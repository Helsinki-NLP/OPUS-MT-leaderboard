The women's platoon is expected to defend the World Cup early!
On 27th, in the game against Dutch women, the Chinese team was taken back in a city by his opponent in two games, and finally won at 3:1 Rick Holland.
The World Cup is nearing its end, and while the crown is on the rise, the Chinese women's platoons are still not to be light.
The first two games with the Netherlands, the Chinese women's platoons were as strong as they were, 25:19, 25:16, two cities, until the third round, and the team had a setback.
Dutch women's platoons have increased the offensiveness of the ball, and the Chinese team was hit, and the girls were attacked, and the mistakes began to increase, and eventually got back to a city at 21:25.
In an interview, after the race, Rongping also stated: " The third round, we sent about eight points because of the mistake. "
Of course, Dutch women are not allowed to be small, and Chinese women are prepared before the Chinese women's platoon, and despite losing one game, everything is still in Rongping's hands, " It's normal to win and win the strong team, and it's normal to play five games, so we say, " Rong Ping says so.
The fourth round, the team is actively adjusting, and Zhang Chang Ning is on fire at the end of the attack, and the single game gets eight points to win the team.
So far, there are only two rounds left in the 11 rounds of confrontation, and the Chinese women's platoons, although one hand has touched the championship trophy, but the more the alarm was ringing the Chinese women's platoon in the Dutch team: the more the critical moment, the more you have to do it.
In another race on 27th, Russian and American women were full of five games, and the United States team failed to take three points from its opponent, so that Chinese women could achieve the coronation in all three points in the race against Serbia.
The situation is moving towards a favourable situation for Chinese women's rows.
However, while the six main forces of the Serbian team are missing, this does not mean they will give three points easily to the Chinese team.
In the current form of the score list, the Serbian team is almost ungodly medals, which means they can "lightly fit" in the Chinese women's platoon, and put down their burdens to hit the opponent, while the Chinese team is under the pressure to win the crown, but they may rise and fall.
Moreover, the replacement Serbian team was not a lamb who was killed by anyone, who had previously fought with the Dutch team in five games, and Serbia II finally turned the Dutch main force formation, thus showing the depth of its formation.
Before the third stage of the game, Rong Ping also said that both teams of Sey were hard: " Osaka's game will be very difficult, and we're still going to be prepared as usual. "
Now the horn of the coronation has blown, and the game is really in the "white heat phase."
In terms of power, Chinese women's rows are above their opponents, but at the last moment, and see if the girls can play normal and release themselves on the field.

However, if a hero walks around, it seems like you are as ordinary as me.
Yuan Rongping, a small rice research, has grown up a lot of people, and has left a billion people from hunger, and is not a good thing, and it's like an old farmer who likes to walk in the field; Nan In-dong, the Qin-dong, the chief scientist who has been so angry with China's eyes, one person, one life, a pot, a life-long one thing, eating cold buns in the mountains in Guizhou, and the old man in the castle is like a man in the mountains of Guizhou; Zhou Chang, a red scientist, a village boy who has been in a very late village, still like a red son, learning to the west, and a white hair, and he says, "I'm going to be a big fan, and I'm going to be a big fan of the world, and I'm going to be a big fan of the world, and I'm going to be a big fan of the world.
They, who seek kindness, live in a simple life, be simple and committed, and if they don't understand, they're easy to live, and they don't care about the famous, rich and rich.
Like in the Golden Man's novel, the scavenging monk of Shaolin Temple, who is in the middle of a world of martial arts, is not a man of joy.
Every "sweeping monk," every red heart, has a home for whom I am.
The country is not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hands of millions of people.
Once, a female high school student was turned crazy by the Internet, "When heroes pass, someone has to sit by the road and applaud I don't want to be a hero, I want to be a man sitting by the side of the road. "
Actually, it's not a contradiction to be a hero and a hero.
The man who applauds the roadside is also passing heat and light, and he's a luminous body.
As ordinary as me, there's always a chance in my life, some moments, a day of time, and a hero.
Shanghai's excellent judge Zou Beihua, who took responsibility for judicial reform, gave the teacher of the room to tell his story at the annual meeting, and received numerous newspaper letters a year, and never wrong, "Do simple things, it's not easy." Zou Beihua led the judge gave a round of applause to the old "Sweep Monk."
It's a hero's relationship. It's a hero who's applauding another hero.
The monk has a temple of Shaolin, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experiment field, Nan Indong has a "eye" and Qin Yi has a stage, Zhou Yuchang has a forum... whether to be a hero, not on its own, to work on its own, to have a better environment and a positive incentive.
Like "China Sky Eye," and now it seems, it's a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese technology community was still climbing hard, and novelist Liu Tzu-hyun had not yet written "three bodies."
The best eye at that time was the single-calibre radio telescope in the Puerto Rican Valley of the United States -- Arecibo, 350 meters in diameter, considered the most unexcessable world.
The Chinese radio telescope was less than one tenth in diameter.
South Indong, who enjoyed world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insisted on returning home to bring back a near-crazy idea: building a new generation of radio telescopes in China, receiving more messages from outer space!
China is a waste of money to play stars?
The country trusts South Indong, the Skyeye project is a huge opening.
It took 12 years to set up a project and nine years.
The 500-metre sky eye opened, and China made no precedent, "the world's unique scientific engineering."
So, the Eye of Heaven is great, the South In-dongs are great, the big-looking republics are great.
With the trust of the nation, the good faith of the nation, the South Indong side has the opportunity to become the spirit of the nation.
A young man with talent, a hero with white hair, and a man applauds on the side of the road, a country like this, beautiful and harmonious.
Waste classification education first entered Jilin Kindergarten, and the environmental concept started with dolls.
On 27th, a kindergarten in Jilin, Jilin Province, conducted garbage classification education, teaching young children to identify recycled waste and other types of garbage.
According to the information received, this is the first time that garbage classification has entered local early childhood education classes.
Recently, the nine departments of Jilin Province jointly issued the Work Programme on the Classification of Waste Classifications for Local Urban Life in Jilin Province.
On the basis of the mandatory classification of waste in Changchun City in 2019, the province decided to conduct a classification of household waste in local cities.
Jilin is one of them.
We want to promote environmental protection through this event to achieve the social impact of young children driving families, kindergartens.
The director of the International Kindergarten, Liu Li-chun, said.
That day, the gardener read the environmental initiative, hoping that the garbage was classified from the child.
After the kids dance low carbon bees, they're grouping up to make a little garbage sort of game.
The mentor also issued a "recoverable" label, suggesting that the kids stick the label to the trash can when they get home and record a little video.
Liu Lijun introduced the kindergarten to promote low-carbon, green and environmental concepts and regularly open environmental lectures.
The garbage dump in the park also has classified trash cans marked with the type of drop.
Teacher teaching the kids what can be recycled garbage, geese, shoot.
According to preliminary statistics, the urban waste generation in Jilin province in 2018 was about 5.652 million tons, all of which were processed in the waste disposal.
Of these, 32.29 million tons of sanitary landfills were burned, 209.23 million tons were burned and 801 million tons were processed using integrated use processes.
After years of effort, the province and municipalities have the capacity to treat waste harmlessly.
In the already released work programme on the classification of waste for urban life in Jilin, it clearly requires in-depth activities such as garbage classification into schools, teaching materials, classrooms, etc., to strengthen interaction between students and parents through the creation of garbage classification songs, songs, comics, microvideos, etc., to "Education a child, influence a family, drive a community, train a generation of new people."

Chirac died. Political heritage is long.
On 26th local time, former French President Chirac died long and was 86 years old.
In the moment of a hundred years of change in the world, the political heritage of this French politician when he was in power was still worthy of our praise.
Chirac was president of France in a very personal way for 12 years.
He inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of De Gaulleism and strongly supporting European integration as a representative of the European Dream.
At the same time, he has a strong advocate of multipolarization and multilateralism in the world, a strategic politician.
That's why the French media judge him as "the distinguished representative of France on the world stage."
One of the political decisions of Hirac is the American-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined Germany to hold the pressure of the United States and walk in the forefront of the war.
A year after the war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increased terrorist activity and made the world more dangerous.
Later, it turns out that Chirac's warning was correct.
In European integration, the unilateralism of the United States is becoming more and more prominent, and the past has been followed by Chirac is undoubtedly a strong inspiration for strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs.
Chirac is also a French politician who makes Chinese familiar and friendly.
He was one of the advocates and creators of the Golden Decade of Central and French relations, and after his first election to French president in 1995, he driven the rapid development of Chinese-French relations with a strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, the Chinese law established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral Chinese-French engagement entered a new phase.
During the period of Chirac, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and cooperation between the two countries in various fields, such as aviation, nuclear energy, rail transport, has made breakthroughs.
The year of the Shirac Initiative, which created a new model of cultural exchange in the history of China.
Chirac's life is particularly impressive about Chinese culture.
His Chinese diplomat is known to present that Chirac can carry Li Bai, Duft's poems, and even accurately judge the history of Chinese copper.
"Not looking at the pyramid, not really to Egypt, not really to China " — a golden sentence comes from Chirac.
In an interview with Xinhua journalists, Hirak said: " The West has concerns about China ' s political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China ' s economic growth and China ' s political position at the international level ...
But I have faith in China myself.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, with experience enough to help it build ideas and values that achieve harmonious development and assume its responsibility on the world stage for a long time ... "
I also believe that China's revival will bring new creative energy to world culture and enrich world culture.
The people have gone, but the political heritage and revelation that Chirac left to the world will last forever.

The Hong Kong District Legislative Council formed a coalition of members against the United States-related Port Act
The Hong Kong District Legislative Council partially formed members issued a joint statement on 27th, expressing strong opposition to the adoption of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 by the Senate of the United States Congress.
This statement, co-sponsored by 40 formed members, states that the current rights in Hong Kong are granted by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including the maintenance of free trade ports and separate customs zones, and bilateral and multilateral agreements in different areas such as the economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, culture, sports, in the name of Hong Kong, China, and trade and development relations.
These rights are not imposed by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has been strictly committed to international agreements, international rules, law and business ethics, cooperation with different countries and territories, and has been very well seen.
The statement states that the actions of the Foreign Committee of the United States House of Representatives are not necessary to respond to the call of its bad Hong Kong agents as a means of brutal intervention in Hong Kong's internal affairs and seeking political chips for their agents in Hong Kong.
The formed members deeply regret that the US will do this and strongly oppose it.
The statement states that Hong Kong is a major trading partner and the largest source of trade surplus in the United States.
Hong Kong's good rule of law, fair and free business environment, a clean society, makes it a good site for American businessmen.
If the United States adopts this bill, in addition to combating Hong Kong and the United States itself, it will make relations between China and the United States worse, without any benefit or damage.
The statement states that Hong Kong will continue to enjoy the rights granted by the Basic Law and effectively fulfil its obligations, as always, without a wave.
In the past, present or in the future, Hong Kong will continue to contribute to the international community and international commerce.
According to the European Times, the French Parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
French President Marlon recently claimed that France could not "take everyone" but also try to "take it properly."
According to reports, Marlon tried to find a compromise route on immigration, slowing down the upcoming debate.
Recently, Marklon, interviewed during his participation in the General Assembly general debate in New York, USA, expressed the hope that there was a real "two-pronged" programme in immigration policy to find a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
Marlon said: " If France wishes to be properly accepted (immigrant), it cannot accept all " .
Marlon lists four priorities of immigration policy: to grant asylum qualifications to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; more efficiently promoting the integration of migrants; receiving and protecting all immigrants entering French territory; more efficient resettlement of persons who are not suitable for illegal entry into France.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance (AME) system, the most discussed topic in all sectors before.
Marlon said he wanted to be able to "evaluate" the system, but did not cancel it, but rather limit it.
After Marlon made this statement, Le Pen, the leader of the extreme right-wing National Union, tweets that Marlon's statement was "empty talk."
Right-wing Republicans, Senate Speaker Rachel, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "reducing" but "to-real" approach and indirectly criticize Marlon.
Left Socialist Congressman Varau believes that France should "take more, better" on immigration, and criticize Marlon for "playing."
The report states that the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act has been enacted for a year, leading to differences within the ruling party, but it is unable to calm the right opposition.
In the next 2022 election, immigration policy topics will once again become the focus of extreme right-wing attacks, and Marklon needs to do something on this issue, but will also risk angry the left-wing within the ruling party.
It was reported that the lower house of the French National Assembly would debate immigration policy as of 30 September, while the Senate had a debate on 2 October.
There are signs that China A shares are on the way to buy back, and many listed companies have come back to the company's shares.
According to the financial data service provider Eastern Wealth, as of 27 days, the total amount of A listed companies repurchased in 2019 exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, same), far above the same period of previous years, and had a record high in the amount of A stock repurchase funds.
In response, Xu Yang, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Maikoron Information Consulting Limited, stated that the overall valuation of the A stock market was lower this year, repurchased shares at relatively lower prices, which would facilitate the efficiency of the use of funds by listed companies, as well as the willingness of listed companies to manage the market value and the full cash flow position, which would help to boost investor confidence.
In addition, a well-developed stock buyback system has contributed to the active repurchase of listed companies.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued rules for listing companies to buy back shares, providing detailed rules and guidelines for repurchase of shares for listed companies.
According to the media, since this year, listed companies that have implemented an additional buy-back scheme have been concentrated in the infrastructure industry, the real estate industry, the information technology industry and the electronics manufacturing industry.
In addition, from the amount paid for the buyback, six listed companies have repurchased over $1 billion this year.
Of which, the first of them was the Ely shares, which returned to over $5 billion.
What will happen to the market when listed companies buy back stocks?
In an interview with a journalist from the Chinese New Society, Zhao Sijun, Vice-President of the Chinese People ' s University School of Finance and Finance, stated that the buyback showed that listed companies had a strong economic strength and a better financial position, and had the ability to maintain stock price stability and confidence in investors; on the other hand, indicate that listed companies and their controlling shareholders were responsible for the company, accountable to the market and to investors.
The former is based on good corporate performance, while the latter requires higher quality for listed companies and their controlling shareholders.
For capital markets, this is the core fundamental element.
Repurchase of shares by listed companies helps to boost investor confidence and support the stock prices of listed companies.
According to the Eastern Securities Research, the increase in the stock market for the A stock market is expected to exceed $150 billion this year, based on the projected stock buybacks as a whole since the beginning of this year and the average price of repurchased shares.

To protect, save mother's ancestors, the ancient cultural street board and the Queens Palace in Tianjin City launched the restoration of the temple and interior murals.
The restoration was led by Cai Chang-kyu and invited four famous national painters to join us.

We've also made innovations and attempts in color, materials, pen ink, etc.
After repairing, the original mural was maintained, spiritual, spiritual and artistic style.
The Queen's Palace was built in 1326, formerly known as the Mother's Palace, commonly known as the Mothers' Palace, the oldest complex in Tianjin City, and one of the first mother temples in China.
On September 25, the launch ceremony at Beijing International Airport was held.
The Beijing Dae-Hing International Airport terminal is called the top of the Seven Miracles of the New World.
At present, Beijing Capital International Airport is an overloading state, carrying 100 million plus passengers last year, becoming an airport in the second year of the world, after Atlanta Airport, the second year of the world.
It is expected that by 2022, the volume of passengers at Beijing Dae-Hing International Airport will have reached 45 million times, with an international flight of 20 per cent; by 2025, 72 million passengers will have been swallowed and international flights are expected to reach 30%.
As the New Gate, how cool is it?
Beijing Dae-Hing International Airport, located between Beijing and Guangyang, is 46 km from Tianan Gate, the largest new airport in the world.
The roof-cover steel structure of its terminal has a surface projection of 180,000 square metres and 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Dae-Hing International Airport is the world's first terminal with two arrival and two departure floors — F1-F4 international arrival, domestic arrival, domestic departure, international departure.
The two-storey bridge outside the terminal is connected to the high-speed and airport, corresponding to the terminal F3, F4 -- international departures on the upper floor, both domestic departures.
Beijing's first flight at Dae-hing International Airport has opened the era of Beijing's "two airports".
The new airport is located as a large international aviation hub, the country has developed new power sources to support the construction of the Kyojin region, and 66 airlines have been interested in entering Beijing International Airport, 20 of which are in the Hong Kong Australian region and foreign airlines, and airline flights have been approved at a time.
In the winter spring season of 2019, Beijing Dae Xing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, 101 domestic routes and 15 international routes; 112 global points, including 97 domestic points and 15 international points.
This is a coordinated development, moderate competition with Beijing Capital International Airport, an internationally competitive "two hub" airport pattern, which eases the saturated operational pressure of capital airport capacity and better meet the urgent need for rapid growth in air transport in Beijing and surrounding areas and effectively improving the international competitiveness of our civil aviation industry.
To ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Da Xing International Airport fully takes into account geographical location, the relationship between the airport and the surrounding airspace and the operating environment, and the airport runway has first adopted a "full-way" layout in the country, using the world ' s largest air pipe automation system, which has established China ' s maximum terminal control zone to maximize aviation efficiency.
Airports of this size in the country use nationalized automatic baggage processing and information management systems for the first time, using innovative baggage transmission patterns to improve the efficiency of baggage systems.
Beijing Da-Hing International Airport is the first flight, which is a sign of Phoenix's wings and cool.
This has created more than 40 international, country-owned, with a nationalization rate of over 98 per cent of the new airports, which will have a direct and indirect economic impact on the surrounding industries and injecting energy into Beijing economic development.
Maverick's meeting in November is scheduled to be transferred to 16 years old.
The Central Congress was held in early November to amend the party to be transferred to 16 years old.
As Congress passed the lower age of voting, Mahua announced that the 66th Central Congress will be held this year, making proposals to amend the party chapter, including the lower age of Mahua's entry, from the current 18 to 16.
According to the President of the Mahua General, Nadusly Wei Jia-sang, the Central Council of Mahua was scheduled to hold a central congress on 2 and 3 November this year, but that the dates of the General Assembly may change as a result of the sub-election of the meeting of the State of Dan Yui.
He said that, since the Electoral Commission would meet only on 1 October to conclude the mid-election and voting days of the Danyu-Ai seat, they would meet the following day, on 2 October, to discuss whether to change the date of this year ' s Central Congress.
He also explained that the purpose of the Chinese Commission yesterday (26) was to finalize the date of the Congress and to modify the party, but had just happened to have just happened to have reached the unfortunate death of Congressman Nadu Mohamfa, a member of Parliament, and thus joined the agenda for the sub-election of the State.
Secretary Wang Bao-sang, Secretary of the Su-gwang County of Shandong, Zhang County, Red Heart, Xinhua Network
Wang Bo-sang, Shandong, born in February 1943, worked in 1967, and served as Secretary of the Towns Party, District Secretary, Mayor, etc.
In 1986, Wang Bo-sang was Secretary of Su-gwang County, Shandong Province, when the lifelight was a poor county in the factory.
In the five years of lifelight, Wang was a man of his heart and focused on three things: the first was to promote the industrialization of vegetables; and the second was to develop the North Salt Beach; and the third was to lay the foundation for the industry, and the lifelights were raised from the pocket and raised the waistboard.
Lifelight farmers have a tradition of food and lessons from cooking.
In the early 1980s, life-light farmers couldn't sell food and rot in the ground.
Wang Bo-sang found that the key to the catch of vegetables is to get the flow.
Lifelight first built the vegetable wholesale market, opening up the development of the market economy.
Party cadres are going to lead, screw up, everything's lost in the county.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Bo-sang, 17 members of the three-dollar village Wang Loi-yi made 17 winter warm vegetable sheds, when 17 "two million households" came out.
The county then established a outreach team, which, with the mobilization of Wang Bao-sang, was guided by Wang Loi's tour in various towns; more than 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted in the first year, and then the vegetable sheds pushed to the whole county and the whole country.
For centuries, 1.6 million acres of land in the north, except salt-alkali beach, are shallow beaches.
The local crowd lives very hard.
Su-nam has a vegetable shed. What about Su-bei?
Wang Bo-sang organized a battle of hundreds of thousands of people, encamped on the desert beach for 40 or 50 days.
Wang Bo-sang and the county's leaders were eating on the site, pushing cars like civilian workers, and the people saw them all stretch their thumbs and impressed... when Subei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a "coup pot" on salt-alkali beach.
In July 1986, Wang Bo-sang participated in the Industrial Conference of the City of Yuen Fong for the first time as a county secretary.
During the meeting, a "Specific Comparison of Industrial Economy in the Twelve Countys of Yum Fong City " was released, and at first glance the total industrial product, good lifelight, fourth place.
But if you take the salt off, the pure industrial value of lifelight is only $119 million, and it's third in the last count.
Wang Bo-sang ran out of the field with a 70-person troupe.
Less than a year later, the county invested $150 million and went on 77 projects.
Every year since then, we've organized the "Create" to Shenzhen, East China and Shanghai.
Life is short of business, less entrepreneurs.
Wang Bo-sang chaired the panel of the special meeting: the director of the factory was publicly selected throughout the county, and 40 "business-minded people" emerged and pushed into the industrial line.
In 1991, Lifelight entered the country's 100-Power county, and Wang Bae-sang was transferred to Deputy Mayor of the city of Yuen Fong.
He left over 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp pools, 4854 businesses, over 100,000 "millions of households" and are recognized cadres.
On 26 September, local time, the Council of State and Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired the Foreign Ministers of China and the Council of African States at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The current member of the Council of Africa, Tano, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Equatorial Guinea, Oyono, Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa, Pandor, Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa, and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Niger, Kera, Tunisia, attended the meeting.
Wang Yi made four recommendations on strengthening cooperation between the Central African parties in the Council.
First, by unity.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, with direct consequences being challenged by basic norms of international relations, and the role of the United Nations has been hit and the interests of a wide range of developing countries, including African countries, and small and medium-sized countries.
To address this challenge, it takes Central Africa to pull hands and stand side by side, to unite.
In the Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, and the focus is not just three votes, but the continent as a whole.
China and Africa stand together, not only four votes, but will lead other countries to follow up, influence and shape the agenda of the Council.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with Council members of the Council, which needs to be fully used.
Second, we'll settle the dispute by negotiation.
China has been advocating political solutions to hot spots, Africa has a good tradition of consultation and experience with successful good offices of African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex challenges on the Council ' s agenda, particularly the African hotspots, are mostly the root of colonial burying, while others are directly related to external factors.
We're going to use chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations together to play the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation, etc.
Third, self-empowerment.
African countries and peoples know Africa's most well-known problems, and Africa has the capacity to solve their problems with wisdom.
In addressing the issue of hot spots in Africa, the Council should focus on listening and respect for Africa ' s will and should play the role of regional and subregional organizations and should encourage and support internal solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with the African side and firmly advance capacity-building for autonomous peace operations in Africa.
Fourth, it's based on development.
China and a wide range of African countries are developing countries, and we must insist on putting economic and social development first and support each other in their own path of development.
China is willing to build the "Away" with the AU Agenda 2063, the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, which is closely linked to African development strategies to help African countries strengthen their development capacity and address the root causes of conflict.
We're going to work together to increase the United Nations's investment in Africa's development.
The Ebola outbreak has re-emerged, and China has and will continue to be fully supportive, providing within the capacity of manpower, material assistance and is willing to coordinate action with African countries to mobilize additional assistance such as the United Nations, WHO and others, to play a good role in the United Nations Democratic Republic of the Congo (KIM) Stabilization Mission.

Trudo's "The Man Falling." Can he still be re-elected?
This time, Trudo tripped out of a big hole, and Trudo dug it up a little bit.
Recently, Canadian media have been exposed to several old photos of current Prime Minister Trudo, where Trudo dressed himself as black.
It's considered a clear act of racial discrimination, which is causing a huge wave in Canada.
Trudo apologized repeatedly after what happened.
However, the Canadians don't buy much.
Trudo was a rock and hit his feet.
As political commentators Riley et al. have pointed out, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party have been high-profilely accusing opponents of "defeating" in this regard, and has repeatedly threatened that "who makes such mistakes should be fired immediately."
In short, this time Trudo tripped a big hole, which was a little bit dug up by Trudo himself.
Trudo was the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudo, young and handsome, who had just left the road with a cyclone of political idols.
He was originally a political man, who took over as the head of the Federal Liberal Party, and after taking over as the head of the Federal Liberal Party, had an unexpected battle in the 2015 federal legislative election – the Federal Liberal Party had half the seat in the lower house of the Federation and gained valuable individual rights.
At this time, Trudo has proposed many deaf-haired political platforms, such as "ethnic and gender equality " " eco-environmental " economic revitalization " , emphasizing the elimination of corruption and "the wind of injustice".
However, for five years in power, he has been a snake tail in almost all of the above, " walking down " .
Take the issue of "ethnic and gender equality" without talking about this black face incident, and he was "not really good" on a series of indigenous issues, which moved the protest tent to the gate of Congress on the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.
In the end of last year, Trudo was involved in the boiling Lanwanling incident at the beginning of last year.
It was exposed to a major violation of the personal fraud of the construction company Lanwan Ling, who was in charge of the investigation, demanding that the latter be "higher."
Moreover, Trudo, after the big deal, was angry with the officials who disclosed the ills – Wang Cudi, mentioned earlier, was the first to disclose the wrong case, when the Canadian Attorney General was directly involved.
Although the case itself is suspicious, it is difficult to wash.
Many observers have pointed out that Trudo has been in power for five years, mainly by his own "scratch" and that the biggest pit is no better than the three of the tiger's tails, "self-eating their own fruit" and "broaden themselves, and the lawman."
Canada's most authoritative Angus Red poll data show that since 2015, respondents supporting Trudo have slipped from over 60 per cent to over 30 per cent, while opponents have soared from less than 30 per cent to over 60 per cent.
Despite the same poor performance of other opposition parties and their party leaders, even a significant proportion of voters who still vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now not concerned about the federal prime minister, the head of the ruling party.
On October 21, the new Canadian federal legislative election was about to begin, and Trudo could re-enact the winning play five years ago?
The answer could be just one word: hard.
Whether at the competitive level of enterprise, consumer experience level, or regional aviation integration, Kyoto wants to develop integration, has far-reaching implications and positive implications.
On September 25th, Beijing Dae-Hing International Airport officially sailed.
The New Kyoto newspaper journalist learned from the Beijing City Development Commission that the capital airport is in a state of oversaturity and that the opening of the International Airport will enhance the capacity of the capital aviation services.
Following Shanghai, Beijing became our second city with two airports, mainly serving domestic aviation services, and the Pudong Airport is based on international shipping aviation, and future capital and Da Xing Airport will be located to serve the differential positioning of domestic and international aviation operations, providing more detailed services.
Da Xing Airport has a better impact on the capital airport from a business development point of view.
Passenger throughput at the Capital Airport exceeded 100 million times in 2018, at the top of the country, but there is still a significant poor transport capacity compared to the rapid growth of business demand, especially in international route demand.
To better serve domestic and foreign passenger tourism, travel, etc., to adapt to the growing opening of Beijing and international integration of cities, Da Xing International Airport is located as a large international hub airport, and plans to meet 100 million passengers in the future and 4 million tons of mail.
So, the two airports are not overlapping, and there are enough market space for different client groups.
At the economic accounting level, the navigation of the Great Hing International Airport clearly creates a win-win effect to mitigate Beijing air transport tensions, accelerate the growth of passenger and cargo throughput and build incremental cakes for dual-nuclear operation in the capital aviation.
From a user point of view, as the flight of the Great Hing International Airport is not required to focus on travel in the capital airport in the future, or reduce the number of problems posed by over-recentration of routes, such as the increase in the time of over-site security, the speed of passenger boarding, indirectly increasing the time of the stay of aircraft and passengers at the airport, increasing the burden of operating at the airport, which has also improved the travel experience of passengers.
According to the media's measurements of the time and cost of multiple traffic routes to large international airports, such as taking the high-speed direct speed from the south five rings to the high-speed airport, 50 minutes to drive, the oil money is about $40, and the high-speed fee is $15; and the distance is 20 km, 30 km, at a rate of $10, $25,35; citizens can also travel between Beijing West Station to Da Xing Airport for more than 20 minutes.
Overall, citizens have a variety of means of transportation to the airport, and the cost and time are within a reasonable range.
And from the point of view of trend: The location of the airport is located at the Kyojin-Zin-Yong transport hub, and therefore a little distance from the Beijing city area, but reinforced radiation against Hebei, Tianjin, which has facilitated more people to travel, and is of great importance to the economic development of the Hebei, Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei, Tianjin passengers will have access to more international aviation line services at Da Xing International Airport, as can be seen in the traffic planning of the Hing Airport.
The transport facilities at Da Xing Airport are very well equipped, and in addition to the new airport line at Beijing City, there are multiple highways connecting the airport to the surrounding area.
As urban passengers like Dongdong, Fushan, Qingxiang, Qingxiang, can travel to the White Cloud Airport in Guangzhou through the Guang Buddha, the vast and deep highways, and so on, the Beijing surrounding gallery, the Yu An Xin district, and other residents will benefit from the airport and access to easy and efficient aviation services.
As can be seen, the navigation of the Great Hing International Airport has not only added a few runways and several aircraft, whether at the competitive level of business, consumer experience level, or regional aviation integration, the development integration dimension of Kyoto, which is far-reaching and positive, not only about the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, but also to provide a diversified choice for the travel of the population in Kyoto, to promote further improvement in the quality of services in Beijing, and to promote the development of the Beijing shipping industry, and to promote economic and trade development in the surrounding areas of the airport.
So, for the flight of the Great Hing Airport, we have to count not only the small accounts of individuals, but also the big accounts for overall development.

Viet Nam Forum on Economic and Social Issues, held in Tianxiang Province, 2019
Nguyen De-Kin, Deputy Director of the Economic Commission of the Vietnamese Congress, revealed that early this year, Viet Nam ' s economic and social development had shown many new developments and continued to grow.
The Forum focused on economic and social issues highlighted in the previous months of 2019, proposing measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, participants shared views and views on the impact of economic development and partial FTAs in 2019, some prominent issues in Viet Nam ' s economy, prominent issues in Viet Nam in 2019 and four topics such as projections and recommendations for economic and social development in Viet Nam in 2020.
Representatives generally believe that in the first few months of 2019, global economic growth slowed and increased risks and challenges.
Trade friction between major economies has further reduced global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that, despite the global economy's uncertainty, 70 per cent of the world’s economies are stagnating, economic development in Viet Nam remains many welcome achievements, macroeconomic smooth operation, inflation is effectively controlled, with an average of 2.64 per cent growth in the consumer price index in the first half of 2019, the lowest increase in almost three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, although lower than 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, the increase remained high compared to the same period in 2011-2017.
In predicting trends in economic development in Viet Nam for 2019-2020, Dundeying, Deputy Director of the National Centre for Economic and Social Forecasting of Viet Nam, stated that Viet Nam ' s economy had shown a high growth momentum in 2019 in the context of world economic turmoil.
It is expected that Viet Nam ' s macroeconomics will remain largely stable by 2020, and the implementation of FTAs will contribute to trade development, economic restructuring and further strengthening business environment improvement, and Viet Nam ' s foreign export activities will be declining as a result of trade frictions.
Therefore, the monitoring of forecasting early warning mechanisms is needed to actively seek trade relief measures for exports of Viet Nam, to find opportunities to expand new export markets and to facilitate foreign exports of goods such as agricultural and water products.
At the same time, keeping inflation rates at reasonable levels, thereby promoting the development of assistive industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and eco-agriculture.
Liu Chijie, Director of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, held a reception in Siem Reap in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of New China.
Liu Zhijie said that for 70 years of its establishment, China was actively involved in international affairs, contributing more Chinese wisdom and China ' s programme to improve global economic governance and promote global common development, to make an important contribution to world peace and development and bring real benefits to Cambodia ' s economic development and well-being.
Liu Zhijie described that, as the second largest economy in the world, China contributed more than 30% to world economic growth, especially the China "Away Forward" initiative, and that cooperation between local provinces and municipalities in China and Siem Reap and the provinces of the territorial region continues to deepen.
He said that this year was the beginning of the 61st year of China-Cambodia's relationship, and that China's mutual cooperation would be the driving force of local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siem Reap, Disaha, highly commends the great achievements of the new China over 70 years, congratulated China on the results of friendly cooperation between China and Cambodia.
Disaha expects both sides to continue to work together to advance China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, to strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit and to continuously improve the living standards of people.
Disaha said that the friendly interaction between Siem Reap and the provinces and cities of China has so far established a friendly relationship with 28 provinces and cities of China, the large cultural show project "Ugo Smile" and "Ugo Dynasty" landing, Siem Reap-Gangxi Agricultural Model Park, Siem Reap New International Airport Project, Siem Reap Government Officials Specialized Training Course, Siem Reap School Scholarship, Rural Clinic, Change Urban Roads, White Barrier Reming Public Interest Project, "The Light Line" and, in the friendly cooperation of Cambodia, the people of Siem Reap became a direct beneficiary.
The Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Kenvinson, President of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, the Governor of the 5 provinces of the district, Siem Reap Branch of the Cambodian Council, volunteer teachers, Siem Reap Branch of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia, representatives of Chinese-owned enterprises and representatives of the foreign Siamese Consulate attended the reception.
The 10 years of digital China's "The Cloud Rise" in the town of Yunming.
If the 2009 local website forum is the original point, the 2019 Cloud Habitat Congress in Hangzhou has been in Hangzhou for 10 years.
From a concept of "in the clouds" to the "up cloud" practice, big data, cloud computing became one of the core technologies to support China's economic development, social management, public services for 10 years.
At the new energy photovoltaic battery workshop in Heining, Zhejiang Heining, recently a number of new "co-worker" with Aliyun's artificial intelligence.
It's 24 hours away, and it's more than twice as fast as manual, and the quality check accuracy rate is more than 95%.
According to the head of the company, the "quality examiner" with the camera has focused on over 40,000 defective samples, which, with the cloud computing behind it, can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages and place defective battery plates.
This company is just a microcosm of today's cloud computing-aided manufacturing transition.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the Guide to Promoting the Implementation of the Clouds in Enterprises in 2018 (2018-2020), which proposes to achieve a significant increase in cloud awareness and motivation in enterprises by 2020, with a significant increase in the proportion of clouds and applications.
Wang Kin, founder of Aliyun, said that today, data-centred cloud computing has built bridges for the digital economy of key elements and has opened a way.
Meanwhile, the cloud computing industry has grown in 10 years.
The White Paper on Cloud Calculator Development, published by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July this year, shows that the overall market for cloud computing in China was $96280 million in 2018, an increase of 39.2 per cent over 2017.
Besides becoming a key technology to support industrial transformation, digital economic development, invisible clouds have changed urban management and social life without knowing.
At this year's Clouds Congress, the city brain, which was seen for three years in a row, remains a matter of concern.
In the case of Aliyun, the urban brain has now become a central urban management hub from transport governance tools, and the collaborative applications have expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brain, through a strong computing capability, allows new urban management services such as "stop and pay first" "in real time perception of the number of visitors" and "tourism route design".
In the area of government services, the "one cloud" is connected to one thing, and the "hand office" is moving forward, cloud computing has facilitated both ends of the supply of government services.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform throughout the province through the government.
As of 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million resident population and over 15 million legal persons in the province, which brings together data from 3066 categories of 19,080 billion.
The average monthly call between the Zhejiang government departments has been shared 12 million times, and every time the data flows on the cloud may mean that the crowd is running less.
Be careful with plastic tea and make tea!
According to Central Society, a recent Canadian study has found that a pack of plastic tea packs may release billions, even billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than the number of microplastics estimated by a person throughout the year, but there is no evidence to date that the intake of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
Researchers at Margil University, Canada, reportedly found that plastic tea bags were immersed in a glass of almost boiled hot water (95 degrees Celsius), and that the tea bag would release about 1.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This number is significantly higher than the number of microplastics estimated by a person throughout the year.
According to research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
According to the information received, the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea packs at Montero Shop and Café, opened the tea bag, and soaked the tea bag into almost boiling water for five minutes, and then analysed with electronic microscopes and spectrometers.
According to this study, they found that a single tea bag released over 1.6 billion plastic particles, " several levels higher than the plastic load of other foods " .
According to reports, most tea bags are made of natural fibres, but many of them still use plastic to seal them.
Some of the branded tea bags are no longer made of paper and plastics, and these plastic tea bags are the subject of researchers.
Plastic particles are small pieces of plastics, and researchers define these microplastic sizes between 100 and 5 cents, mainly from plastic waste decomposition.
Researchers find plastic particles, tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer in air, soil, rivers and the deepest ditch around the world.
Researchers first found plastic particles in human excreta samples in several countries in different regions around the world in October 2018.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea packs, the Canadian research team put fleas in contaminated water, and found that microplastics could affect the behaviour of these fleas and caused them to develop malformations.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that the intake of plastic particles is a threat to humans.
However, WHO noted that more research was needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what impact they had on humans.
Researchers assume that the reason why these tea bags release a large amount of plastic particles may be in contact with boiling water, and even when "eating grade" plastics are heating to 40 degrees Celsius, toxic substances may be broken down or infiltrated.
Gutierrez says that climate emergencies are the greatest threat to the survival of small island countries.
There, a natural disaster will erode the development of a generation.
This is clear in Barbuda, Dominica and the Bahamas, which have been hit by hurricanes since this year.
About a quarter of the small island developing States live at 5 metres or lower above sea level.
Relocation may seriously affect their social and lifestyle, even causing sovereignty and national identity problems.
At the Climate Action Summit this Monday, small island countries worked together to achieve carbon and 100% renewable energy by 2030, thus bringing the world in the right direction.
Gutierrez said, " The climate crisis is building up new injustices on old injustices ...
Despite the small contribution of small island developing States to global warming, the highest cost is paid.
As these countries are middle-income, many countries are also trapped in a accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and it is time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States ... "
Today ' s high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for assistance to small island developing States in managing disaster risks, investing in climate-adapted infrastructure and ways to transform renewable energy; urges international institutions to help small island developing States, particularly heavily heavily heavily financed middle-income countries.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of the conservation and conservation of the Earth ' s lifeline — the oceans.
The latest special report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week confirms that the oceans have suffered the "crowd" serious consequences of the climate crisis.
By mid-century, many regions may have seen some extreme sea level rise that will only happen once a century.
The report warns that some island States are likely to become uninhabitable without investing heavily in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.
In the last 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, and plastic pollution has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.
Industry, shipping, mining and tourism demand is leading to reduced resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small island countries also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets that are subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.
Gutierrez said: " By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere ...
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples available worldwide ... "
He stressed that small island developing States were special examples of sustainable development.
They require long-term attention and investment from the international community as a whole.
The Ministry of Finance of India has indicated that the financial system is fully liquid.
Indian Minister of Finance, West Taraman, stated that the financial system was currently fully mobile and that, driven by the demand for holiday consumption, India's economic growth was expected to recover in the second half of the fiscal year.
Setaraman made the statement following meetings with representatives of private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks, etc. in India.
Setaraman didn't explain what these statements were targeted.
Some of the previous Indian media and overseas media blame the continued slowdown in the Indian economy on the liquidity tension of non-bank financial institutions.
Setaraman, for example, took the example of a decline in car sales, denying liquidity tension as the main cause of the decline in sales.
Setaraman notes that the decline in car sales is mainly affected by cyclical factors.
Setaraman expects that India's economy will recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
India's annual shopping season will begin in September and will continue until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will greatly contribute to India's economic growth.
The Jiangxi Department of Education recently issued a notice that schools in the province are strictly prohibited from breaking the rules during the Fourth of July and to conduct random visits by the organization.
In the next "Notice on the Prohibition of the National Day of the Day of the Republic", the Department of Education of Jiangxi Province stressed that primary and secondary schools everywhere should be firmly done during the Fourth of July: no students may be organized or new classes, no subject training courses, special classes, Osei classes, interest classes, promotion classes, etc., and that no school buildings may be rented to other educational institutions for various types of training courses.

The notice is clear that, with regard to the investigation of violations in small and secondary schools, the local education administration will be increased in the district government ' s high-quality development education appraisal of the year; teachers involved in violations will be taken seriously in accordance with the relevant provisions of the teacher ' s style.
Supporting pig production and ensuring market supply
The loyalty requires six measures to be implemented.
The provincial video conference to promote the supply of raw pig production security markets is held today to implement the Central and Provincial Councils, and the provincial government's policy measures to support the supply of raw pig production to secure market supply.
The loyalty requires that measures be implemented in six ways to capture the production of raw pigs.
The mayor of the basket is responsible for the implementation of the 45 million pig-born pigs in the province this year.
Take care of policy measures and effectively address the "last km" problem of policy implementation.
Catching the production of sow pigs, seriously implementing the policy of subsidies for the breeding of pigs, encouraging pig-planting enterprises to expand the scale of pig breeding and systematic selection of good pigs from the commodity pig group.
Take the offer and make it work, and make it a top priority for large domestic farming companies that have not yet entered our province.
Take care of the market flow system, accelerate the construction of the cold chain logistics facility for the pig, and promote a full shift from "piggy" to "smelting meat".
Take care of the modern disease system, with grass-roots quarantine personnel adapted to the scale and tasks of farming and work to build the first line of prevention and control of the disease.
Faith requires that the meat market supply be fully guaranteed, ensuring that there is no large shortage, a wide-scale supply and a steady supply of pork on major holidays.
The meeting also continued to capture African pig plague control, and the suspension of important waters in the Yangtze Basin in our province was deployed, and the city's mid-night rice acquisition was deployed.
The old Shanghai word for the motherland, the spirit of the nation, the white rabbit, is a party class for college students.
"Me and my country" campus are a little bit of a game for college students to be happy.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Shanghai soap, Shun Man-sung, the big white rabbit, has come to four famous Shanghai old-names of the Chinese Polytechnic University on 27th day, and four representatives of Shanghai, with an average history of over 90 years of old Shanghai, and a national spirit for over 200 youth students.
The old brand of the scene is displayed.
The love in the classroom has made the students wonder that the old-named product display outside the classroom and the "Me and my country" campus are making college students happy.

"Some overage farmers on sites are estimated to account for more than half.
Where are we going to find young workers now?
There's no way to use so many old people on the site. "
Recently, there have been a lot of overage migrant workers (over retirement age) on the site, and Zou Qui, who has been a contractor in the construction industry for a long time.
In recent days, the pen's college has been conducting rain-smuggling projects, and there have been a lot of farmers on campus, and if you watch it, you'll find a lot of overage farmers in here.
Overage farmers' workers are not "free" but because "can't be free" and have "necessary" and hard work – whether saving money to solve their old age and medical problems, or helping children, drive these old people who should be "free" to continue working hard.
The "old man" of overage farmers is not as easy as we thought.
Child-rearing, maintenance of the elderly, for children to read, help children build buildings to buy cars, help children to build up their homes, to raise their grandchildren, and when these farmers have done their "life mission", the bags have been empty and even a lot of debt, mostly without wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag children and to save some wealth for themselves, a lot of migrant workers insist on doing it until they can't do it.
Many new generations of migrant workers after 80, after 90 and after 00, are reluctant to engage in difficult conditions, second industries or low-end services, creating structural "work wastes", which are unattractive jobs that provide opportunities for over-age farmers.
Because of the lack of a skill, a decline in physical and labour capacity, a lot of over-age migrant workers are doing a lot of work with high intensity, low income, high risk, low security.
It's a day to be a day, and it's a little more profitable, and the survival dilemma behind "no free" workers can't be ignored and ignored.
Addressing unpaid and wage-seeking challenges, sound labour protection, reducing security risks, increasing labour income, improving the survival of older farmers, except for their "self-recovering " , and also without the public sector ' s institutional protection and human care.
Some scholars have pointed out that overage migrant workers are unlikely to rely on their home-based land to solve their problems of old age and medical care, and that they must feed their families in other ways.
Reading the helpless and strong "no time" of overage farmers helps us to better understand the love and pain of overage farmers.
Seeing the back of older farmers, hearing their sighs, trying to get them back to the country who really achieve "old and good" and need to share responsibility in the public sector, markets and society in good interaction, and need multiple forces.
Chemezov said that Russia would not export this system in the next five years, because "the first supply of its own army will not be exported until then."
This approach is fully in line with international practice.
The main producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their defence needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Grehoff, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force, stated that the system was about to be developed.
The S-500 system was developed by Diamond-Antai's empty defense, Concene.
This is a new generation of air defence systems that use the working principles used to destroy ballistics and aerodynamic targets.
The main function of S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles and intercept missiles below 3,500 kilometres.
In addition, according to some information, S-500 can destroy high ultrasound cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of drones, more than five times sound speed missiles, even targets in near space.
This weapon can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems, especially S-400, which is very important from a defence perspective.
Sergei Chemezov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said the system was currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian army needed it, including in the Arctic.
S-400 air defence system entry into the Arctic Air Defence Corps.
According to the news of 15 September, the conversion of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system on New Land Island has been completed.
This is not Russian militarization in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is a process within the transition plan to move towards more advanced defense tools in the north strategic direction.
According to the Russian Northern Fleet News Service, " With the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, the controlled airspace in the Arctic has increased significantly ... "
It is important that, according to the military assessment, the system has been used successfully in the polar and Arctic regions.
Air defence forces trained the new system and prepared to enter combat duty.
The S-300 remote air defence system was previously equipped, and it is still part of it.
Speaking of air defence systems, it must have weapons that can destroy various air targets, whether it is a target of high-speed flight in outer layers or a fish that is close to protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Trimph system, developed by Gold Diamond-Antei, was designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high ultrasound targets and other air attack weapons.
This weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within 400 kilometres of range and shoot down ballistic targets at 4.8 km per second within 60 km of distance.
Russia never hides its deployment of air defence forces in the polar northern region to ensure the safety of airspace on the northern sea road.
Not long ago, the first 12 Tor-M2DT air defence missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, sufficient to form an air defence camp to strengthen air defence systems in the Arctic.
The Russian Ministry of Defense then said that the Arctic Tor unit would be extended to a complete brigade-level formation in the future.
Plus the new S-400 remote systems deployed to the New Island and Cora Peninsula and the "Pantsir-SA" short-range system deployed in the polar northern region, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are strongly defending Russia's polar sky.
The enemy's aircraft, helicopters and drones will be difficult to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores will be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complex and long process of opening their own stores.
Russian company, which is an operator of Russian stores, focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Russian products are mostly in Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduodoo, HandQ (ShouQ), Multifunctional Instant Communications Software Wechat, and own their own online platforms, Epinduo.com and Russian retail stores.
The Russian Export Centre will work with Russian products to develop shop marketing strategies and participation standards and screen virtual shelf-mounted enterprises.
The store plans to open and install at least 10 Russian manufacturers' products by the end of this year.
According to Russian export centres, the total number of visits by the Chinese electrician platform was 1 billion times a month.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, with over $1 billion in 2018.
Currently, the Ali Baba Group will also open pilot shops within the framework of the Global Import Strategy to sell commodities from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
According to Alexei Kojevnikov, the new store will display goods of enterprises selling at least 500 million roubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and 500 million roubles are not sold enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers are quite active in their attitude towards Russian commodities, considering our commodities as high-quality and green products ... "
Kojevnikov says that competition for Chinese consumers with a strong purchasing power is intense and is increasing.
He said, " Our goal was ambitious and 500 businesses were launched through this store in three years ... "
At the same time, the platform will be built on the products of Russian enterprises in the Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor, Trade Policy Basics, Plehanov University of Economics, Russia, said: " This is a political project representing the image of both sides, as Russian export centres are state-owned, not private institutions ... "
"I don't see a large number of competitive Russian commodities in the market. "
He thought the project would probably not really be implemented, but would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to the Russian News Agency, Andrey Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Centre, during the Eastern Economic Forum, stated that more than 170 Russian enterprises had been published on the largest international wholesale platform, Aliba.com, and could be purchased in China and other countries.
In addition, there is a model of collaboration with the Ali Baba Group, a training project for Russian enterprises from experts from the University of Treasures, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Centre will also be the organizers of the participation of Russian enterprises in industry exhibitions and commercial projects at the Second China International Import Fair in Shanghai in November this year.
A large exhibition will be held in the exhibition hall of 1,000 square metres, which will also be the centre of business project events, signing of agreements, promotions and talks with Chinese business representatives.
Some 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Russian Export Centre News Service said: " In addition to the agricultural stand, we will hold business meetings, namely, to arrange direct links between entrepreneurs ... "

Xinhua Time Review: We're not going to move our own path.
The White Paper "China and the World of the New Age" was released on 27th: for 70 years, China’s development has been successful because, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the right path of Chinese socialism and followed it with determination.
China is the choice of history, the choice of the people.
In recent times, in a situation of weak and internal distress, generations of people are asking for a search for the way to save the country, and they go back.
However, " Constitutional monarchy, re-establishing the emperor, parliamentary, multiparty, presidential system, have thought about it, tried, and the results were not working. "
It was not until the Chinese Communist Party, and with the new China, the Chinese people gradually opened a path of Chinese socialism in practice.
This path out of China is the path of happiness of the Chinese people, the path of the Chinese nation and the path of China to develop together with the nations of the world.
It's because of the right path that China can do its own business to be the second largest economy in the world, contributing the most to global economic growth, to benefit the world with its own development.
As the White Paper has pointed out, this path to China's development is in line with China's national circumstances and adapts to times, and will show bright prospects for development as times move forward.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people value this right path.
The Chinese know the truth about the South Orange North, and the best thing that suits others is not necessarily for themselves, but only for themselves.
It was with this path of confidence and strategic commitment that China created a miracle of the world.
In the twist of human beings, the final conclusion of history was once known for a while.
Today, the success of the Chinese-specific socialist path has declared the end of the "end of history", the collapse of China's collapse, the failure of the "social failure theory".
China ' s success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve the rich and rich, expanding the path of developing countries to modernization, providing experience and learning on the path of countries and peoples in the world that wish to accelerate development and want to maintain their independence.
The world is rich and colorful.
China has always respected the right of States to choose the path fit for their own national circumstances.
China does not "input" foreign models, nor "output" Chinese models, but will remain firm in moving its own path to achieve its own development, strengthen national governance exchanges with countries and make a proper contribution to the common realization of good governance.
Fair Work Commission found that a owner of the Foodworks supermarket fired a 66-year-old female worker by text message because he prefers to hire employees from Asian backgrounds, and the boss's approach was severely criticized as "defeating".
The committee said that Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, Jianbin Wang, who worked at Wagga Wagga's store, was " extremely unfair " and could be contrary to the anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016, and he had been "wanting to fire me," because she wasn't Chinese.
In this case, Peter Sams, Vice-President of the Committee, conducted a search on the Internet and found that Mr. Wang had published some recruitment advertisements at various Australian Chinese employment forums.
One of the job requirements listed in these positions says "first-time Asian lady" and the other says "first Asian employee."
The third post says, "He prefers overseas people."
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by text message in April this year, later claimed that she was absent from 5.10 to $30 in small cash from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said that Mr. Wang's reasons for firing Ms. Ayton were weak and lack of evidence.
She's only been absent for three years, and the missing amount is a few Australian dollars.
He said that Ms. Ayton was fired "not actually related to her behavior or performance."
He said: " In my opinion, with the evidence of the recruitment ad issued by Mr. Wang, the real motive for the dismissal of her is that he would prefer to hire employees with an Asian background ...
Under article 772(f) of Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's actions constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of applicants ... "
Mr. Sams said that it was inappropriate to consider restoring her position in view of Mr. Wang's "horrious" treatment of Ms. Ayton.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, a temporary worker with an hourly salary of $26.
In view of the possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams stated that he would submit his decisions and documents to the head of the Commission to consider whether Mr. Wang should be referred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He said Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any chance to respond to the alleged reasons for firing her.
He said, " I think it's a legitimate and biased procedure for the defense to fire the applicant, Mr. Wang, "waiting" the opportunity, and he thought it would "prove" to terminate the employment of the applicant. "
"He was wrong... and the defense completely ignored any natural justice to her when he fired the applicant, and it was shocking that he was rude and extremely unfair. "
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks was a small enterprise, " it must be frank that any decent employer would not fire its employees in a very unfair and impurity manner recognized in this case ... "
He said, " It's shameful and extremely unfair ... "

The world's highest barber died at 108 years old, and he cut his hair cut for 96 years.
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's highest-age barber in New York, USA, has never retired to cut his hair for guests every day, but Mansinelli died on 19th, thanks to his 96-year-old hair cut.
According to CNN, Mansinelli emigrated to the United States at the age of 8, not long ago at a barber shop to help clean the floor, and started taking scissors to serve the guests at the age of 12 to ease the financial pressure of the family.
Mansinelli was in elementary school, but he didn't graduate.
The son of Mansinelli, Robert, revealed that Dad loved work and people from all over the world liked him, but Dad was diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and that six weeks before his death was finally unable to work because of his physical factors, he didn't retire because he planned to come back to cut his hair when he was better.
Robert 82 said he had to find a new barber now after his father died because he had his father help cut his hair.
The company's repurchased over $100 billion in the year, and it's a record high-level network.
In order to stabilize corporate stock prices and maintain corporate image, listed companies have started to repurchase their shares frequently in the last two years, and through targeted buybacks, pool competitive transactions, etc., hopes to transmit the company's value to the market, thereby stabilizeing stock prices and enhancing investor confidence.
Eastern Wealth Choice data show that listed companies spent $7.9 billion in 2017 on repurchase of shares, increased dramatically to $51 billion in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of A listed companies has been repurchased over $100 billion, creating a new high amount of A stock buy-back funds and far beyond previous years.
From the purpose of the buyback, the company's repurchases appear to be the same as the increase in large shareholders, but there are significant differences in the implementation of the subject, source of funds, repurchase uses, equity itself, etc.
In an interview with the journalist of the Securities Daily Journal, Xu Yang, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai McCorong Information Consulting Limited, stated that the Views on Support for the Repurchase of Shares in November 2018 had been significantly increased against the narrow scope of the stock buyback, complex decision-making procedures and the problems of existing systems such as the poor stock system, which had previously encouraged listed companies to buy back shares from policy.
In January this year, the Institute, which officially issued the " Rules for the Implementation of the Repurchase Shares of List Companies " , which expanded the source of funds for listed companies to buy back, properly simplify the implementation procedures, guide the improvement of governance arrangements and encourage various listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee equity schemes.
After the opinion was introduced, listed companies were able to repurchase shares, with more application, easier repurchase processes and more active shares.
Repurchase of shares in relatively low positions also contributes to the efficiency of listed companies in the use of funds, thereby increasing the level of profits per share, increase net asset returns and reduces pressure on corporate profit indicators.
The greater significance of listed companies to buy back shares than large shareholders and reflect the willingness to manage the market value and cash flows of listed companies.
Xu Yang believes that undervalued stock prices are the main factor in the buyback of listed companies, and that the company ' s stock prices are no longer reflected in the future prospects of the company, and that such companies deserve the attention of investors, but that they cannot blindly invest, and that they need to focus on the financial statements of such listed companies and the specific operations of such listed companies.
List companies with large-scale buybacks show at least the company's development confidence and financial strength.
The enthusiasm for the repurchase of A listed companies has gradually increased and has regularized repurchases, and data show that nearly 1,000 listed companies have already implemented stock buybacks this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main market for buy-backs.
China has recently disclosed progress in repurchases that companies have accumulated repurchased 575.9 million shares through centralized competitive transactions, representing 0.315 per cent of the company ' s total equity, totalling $5 billion (excluding transaction costs) and that the repurchase shares will be used in the employee holding scheme, including but not limited to long-term service plans that have been considered by the Corporate Shareholders ' Conference.
Eli shares have paid $5,792 million for the repurchase of shares and recently adjusted the use of the repurchase shares, and the original planned "repurchase shares will be used as a source of equity incentives" to "a cumulative repurchase of $183 million shares, of which 152 million shares are used to implement equity incentives, and the remaining 300,000 shares will be used to cancel to reduce registered capital " .
The Ely shares indicated that some of the repurchased shares would facilitate further upgrading each share and effectively increase the return on investment of corporate shareholders.
The TCL Group issued a repurchase progress announcement on September 25th that TCL Group cumulatively repurchased 3.59% of the company's shares at a total cost of $1.65 billion.
TCL Group Board Office said to the Journal of Securities Journal journalists that the repurchase of shares would be used for employee equity schemes, equity incentives or corporate bonds that could be converted to stocks issued by listed companies.
TCL Group insists on established business strategies, constantly improving competitiveness and sustainable health development.
Based on confidence in the future development of the company and the maintenance of investor interests, in conjunction with the performance of the secondary market in the last year of corporate stocks and taking into account factors such as corporate operations and financial position, companies plan to repurchase their shares using their own funds, self-financing funds and other financing methods.
The former chief economist of the Sea Open Source Fund, Yang Drum, stated that the operation of listed companies to buy back stocks could reduce the number of shares in the market and increase the share of the listed company, which was an important profit for the second-tier market; and that listed companies were willing to take the initiative to collect real gold and silver, which greatly boost market confidence.
Repurchases of domestic listed companies have gradually increased in recent years, especially those of excellence, and boost investor confidence through stock buybacks is a very good way and a positive and encouraging approach.
The Standing Committee of Hunan Province, Secretary of the Changsha City Council, Hu Jinhua, and the four main masters of the Engineering Mechanical Manufacturing Army — Jan Jin Xin, Liang Shang, Ho Qinghua, Liu Fei-hyang, has set a small target around Changsha from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing — building a world-led engineering machinery cluster in three or five years later.
Building the world's leading engineering machinery cluster in Changsha, and in the words of now fashionable words, it's the strongest on the surface.
As an inland capital city, Changsha shouts this big word. How does it come to the bottom?
It's the power of the air.
Four engineering machinery companies that participated in the dialogue, one of them, covering the sky, underground, sea, land-wide: mountain river smart light aircraft, concrete transport pumps in Central Union, three heavy-worked ground cranes, iron heavy-work tunnel shields, and their "hard power" is a single-step, proud male.
Once upon a time, China had little voice in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
The Chinese company "go out" double-wheel drive, take the East Wind, Acquisition, Merger, Plant Establishment, etc., and then jump into the global engineering and machinery industry.
Of these, the three heavy workers, the Central Union, the Iron Heavy Work, the Mountain River Intelligence, and other major economic indicators, such as production, market share, sales, etc., have significantly led the same enterprise.
It's the camera that moves.
The Engineering Machinery Army, the Four Kings, is the winner of the Changsha Engineering Machinery Cluster and the head of the global engineering machinery industry.
In the world's industry, who survives and survives well is the hard way to talk.
Earlier, the global engineering and machinery industry was in cold winter, and many internationally recognized engineering machinery manufacturing companies fell down, but Changsha's engineering machinery manufacturing companies used "cat winter" as a winter swim, self-pressure, self-break, transformation through industrial structure, from manufacturing to intellectuals, not only through the past, but also stronger body bones.
With the stars, the moon's government is strong.
Developing dominant industries requires both positive business development and government action.
The reputation of Changsha's "the capital of engineering machinery" is to bring together a whole industry chain from upstream to downstream, creating a number of associated industrial clusters, and by optimizing the business environment, improving the support services, simplify the approval process, etc., and the cost of the enterprise's research and development, manufacturing and marketing costs are significantly reduced.
Good business ecology, and engineering machinery manufacturing companies are coming.
History has pushed Changsha to the front desk that built a global engineering machine, and I'm not allowed to do it.
Whether it's government, business, or related production researchers, should take opportunities, and move on, bite targets, keep working, contribute to Hunan power to build a strong country.

Gansu Qingyang: The lake sheep come to the "out of poverty."
The autumn of September is the yellow earth highlands.
In the professional cooperative in the town of Yuma, 58-year-old villagers, Shavili, filled the last grass in the sheep's collar, kept by the sink, watching the white lake sheep chew.
"Eat well, when the autumn winter is full, the bar will be sold at a good price."
Shavili said he fed sheep every day, regularly cleaning, fungicide, and he was waiting for it.
Shavili raised more than 20 years of sheep until he came to the cooperative to work, and I didn't know how thick the sheep were.
Shavili is from the village of the town of the city of Qingyang, Gansu province.
His left neighbor's right house is a sheep's house, but it's a traditional way of dispersing, sheep's quality is poor, and it's small.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Shavili's been working on farming all day because he's always holding a lot of energy.
The people who entered the stock were poor, and they all hosted sheep to the cooperative, and they could all count on him at the end of the year.
Good thing he learned to prevent the disease, and he's got science feeding, became a small number of farming in the village.
The professional cooperative for the pro-people farming industry is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds, with nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
Zou Tao, head of the cooperative, said there was a way out and outside the standardized sheep shed.
"The wool is thick, it is easy to breed bacteria, the lake sheep can't stay in hot and wet places, and the sheep's shed must be built in three ditches, and a wind machine to vent the heat. "
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent the disease, it would also require regular spray to disinfect the sheep's shed and give the sheep three to four times a quarter.
In addition to living well, we're gonna have to eat mixed grass with green corn, wheat grass, tarts, etc., and have a wide enough playground to stretch the bones.
Cooperatives take a hosting approach to leading local farmers to put good lake sheep here, unified breeding, managing, marketing, achieving good breeding, scientificization, standardization, assembly.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep into their shares are divided into over $6,000 per household each year, and four of the pro-poor people working in cooperatives.
From "the whole mountain herding" to "precision feed," from "local mating" to "manual insemination," from "seeing the body, touching the belly" to "be-to-be-to-be-b" in Gansu Qingyang, meat and sheep farming is not just a shift in feeding, but the model of "the Dragon Enterprise + Cooperative + Farmer" has changed the picture of once "sheeping sheep on the hill, selling sheep in the market" and overcome the weak spread of traditional farming, farmers' poor days have become better because of modern sheep.
Zou Tao said that if the market price is weak, the local lead company Gansu China Agricultural Development Co. Ltd. would be bought at a market protection price of $27 per kilo to help farmers spread their market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, General Adviser, Gansu China Agricultural Development Co. Ltd., said that enterprises had led to increasing the growing number of poor households by providing loan guarantees, sheep-planting, order farming, offer acquisition, uniform processing sales, etc.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved a steady increase in the harvest through farming, breeding, scale farming, slaughter division, market sales.
Qingyang City is in the northern farm and livestock, and the grass is rich.
There are currently 913 meat and sheep-scale farming farms, cooperatives, meat sheep raising over 5 million, and two 1.3 million meat sheep slaughter-scale processing production lines, and the sheep are becoming the "lead sheep" of poverty in the land's industry.
The French finance minister said he'd cut taxes by over 10 billion euros next year and called on Germany to follow up.
Reuters Paris 26 September - French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France would cut taxes by over 10 billion euros next year ($10.9 billion), while Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive the depressed economy.
Lemer, introducing the French 2020 budget, stated that the ECB ' s latest monetary easing initiative created an opportunity to increase investment for Governments with capacity to invest.
The ECB dropped interest rates to record a new low on September 12, and plans to restart the purchase debt to lower borrowing costs, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and boost inflation rates.
" Low interest rates will not bring Europe back to prosperity, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough, " Lemel said to journalists ...
"Germany needs to invest now, as soon as possible... don't wait until the situation gets worse and act, he adds.
He has made this appeal to Germany many times.
France has implemented tax cuts of over 10 billion euros this year, which has contributed significantly to France's economic growth.
The German economy, which depends on exports, is the first to be the most powerful in the global economy.
Lemel points out that next year the tax burden on French families will reduce the tax burden of 9.3 billion euros, including 5 billion euros in income tax relief.
In addition, as the corporate tax rate will decline from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over five years, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros.

Research: The United States National Health Diet Index has grown slightly, but still challenges - the new Chinese network
According to the U.S. Expatriate Network, a recent study in the United States has shown that over 16 years, the United States government's health diet index has grown slightly, from 56 to 58.
But with 100 points, it's not worth celebrating.
American nationals still face "a significant challenge" in diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fanfang, a nutrition researcher at the University of Tafts, Massachusetts, said that Americans still have too much food that could cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc., which are the most common diseases among American nationals.
The study was published in the American Medical Association magazine in 24th.
The study was based on the findings of the United States Government ' s health survey of 44,000 adults from 1999 to 2016.
The authors wrote, " Despite significant improvements, significant eating challenges remain " .
These challenges are known to include reducing the intake of snacks, hot dogs, fat cattle, butter, etc., food containing saturated fat.
Research found that the intake of these unhealthy fat in their daily diet increased from 11.5 per cent to 12%, exceeding the recommended 10% intake ceiling.
The biggest improvement in American diet is that the sugar intake has dropped from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
Officially, it is believed that sugar intake should be less than 10% in daily diet.
For the reason for the reduction in sugar intake, researchers believe that it is related to the reduction in the consumption of sweet soda, but Zhang Fan stressed that sugar is often added to less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
American adult intake of fruit, nuts, oatmeal and other whole grain categories has increased slightly.
However, data for 2016 show that the share of these foods in their daily diet is still less than 5%.
Despite a slight decrease in salt intake, the reduction in drinking juice has led to low-quality carbohydrates intake, Zhang Fang indicated that they still account for up to 42% of daily heat, many of which come from processed white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on a biennial personal health survey that reminds adults of the food they eat in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asked twice every few days since 2003.

The deepest record of the Chinese railway tunnel was updated.
On September 27th, the Chinese New Society's security mountain (Zhang Wei Ming) was built day and night, after more than 1,200 days of construction, the construction of a well at the Grand Swe (Ri) railway, the Goligon Mountain Tunnel 1 was dug up on 27th, reaching 762.59 metres below the ground, breaking the deepest record of the Chinese railway tunnel, which was created in a large amount of water surge.
The 34.5 km of the Great Swe Railway, located in Yunnan, is located in Yunnan, and the tunnel is the longest tunnel in Asia's double-line single hole.
This tunnel runs through 19 broken belts, buried at a maximum depth of 1155 metres, as it covers the adverse geological and significant risks that almost all tunnel construction may encounter, and the Goligon tunnel is called the "geological museum" built by the tunnel.
The wells are the most important auxiliary pits of the Goligon tunnel, with an important task of increasing the surface of the operation of "long-twirl" and late railway operations.
The first well was successfully dug to the bottom of the well, marking the official entry of the high-level tunnel into the horizontal tunnel, which could be increased by four more operating surfaces under the well, and the tunnel was being dug up by digging and equipment at the bottom of the well.
"The wells are all in granite layers, because of the large cracks in granite, and the water cannot stop, from top to bottom, basically as deep as the well is pressure ... "
The Chief Engineer of the Dari Railway Project at the Central Iron Tunnel Department told reporters that during the construction of the well, there were multiple risks such as mud and collapse, and the builder invited experts to put a pulse and more than 20 seminars on the scene.
" When the water is pouring in the well maximum, it is over 300 cubic metres per hour, and the bottom of the well is over 700 metres deep, and water pressure is equivalent to 700 metres deep under the sea floor ... "
Shigeki said, " If we don't drain in time, we'll drown 10 meters in an hour, and we'll have almost 85% of our time to cure water, 15% to dig in. "
To overcome geological challenges such as vertical rhythm development, mud surges, water-rich granite, tunnel construction uses a combination of "prospecting, bets, digging" systems to reduce construction risks.
After several improvements, the construction of well 1 has developed a dig-out system, a suspension system, a winch lift system, etc., and has achieved a full process mechanization of eye-playing, blasting, gilling, template installation, concrete construction, etc., and accelerated construction.
Eventually, after more than 1,200 days and nights, the well was successfully completed at 762.59 metres of depth.
The Da-Swe Railway, 330 km long, is an important part of the Central Myanmar International Channel, an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the "Away the Way".
After the construction of the car, Da Lisi's travel time will be reduced to two hours from the current road to two hours, and will significantly improve the transport patterns in the Fixi region and contribute to promoting economic and trade cooperation and friendly contacts between China and South-East Asian countries.

The United Nations awarded the Earthguard Award for the Ant Forest.
In a warm applause and rejuvenating music, the director of the Ant Forest project, Seo-di and user representative Shen Xian-Lang, walked to the stage and took the 2019 United Nations Earthguard Award from the host.
The 2019 Earthguard Award ceremony was held in New York, USA, on 26th, and the "Ant Forest" project, which led hundreds of millions of people to participate in environmental action, won the Incentives and Action Award.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced its award list at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but the award ceremony was still hard to hide.
In an interview with the journalist of Xinhua, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Ine Annosen, stated that the Ant Forest was an exciting innovation that allowed hundreds of millions of people to move on to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans could do for the environment.
It connects people to the environment with technology, allowing every individual to participate in the protection of the Earth, which will have a huge impact.
The Ant Forest was launched by the China Ant Financial Services Group (known as ant gold suit) in August 2016, where users "plant trees" by recording green trips in their daily lives in the Ant Forest, paying online for electricity and electricity, etc.
Every time a user grows a virtual tree, the Ant Forest and a public interest partner plant the next tree in the desertification area.
As of August this year, 500 million ants forest users had a cumulative reduction of 7.92 million tons of carbon emissions and 122 million trees in desertification areas.
In the Earthguard Award awarded that day, Costa Rica won the award for national environmental efforts, and the President of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado, who came to the award, praised the contribution of the Ant Forest on the scene, "to stimulate so many people to participate in green action, impressive."
Ii Hyun-dong, Chairman and CEO of Ant Gold, said that the Earthguard Award was a recognition of the Ant Forest project.

Ii Hyun-dong says that the ants forest has affected 500 million people over the past three years, and the goal of the ant forest for the next three years is to lead 1 billion people around the world to participate in low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers more of their income from green water in Qingshan.
In addition to providing employment opportunities through tree planting, it is hoped to help farmers achieve increased revenue through agricultural development projects, electrician platforms, etc.
The public good environment model created by the Ant Forest is also successfully developed by other countries.
In June this year, the largest electronic wallet in the Philippines, GCash, launched the Philippine version of Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low carbon.
GCash was described as working with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, the Environmental Public Interest Organization, and plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within a year of project launch.
The Earthguard Award is the highest United Nations award in the field of environmental protection, awarded annually.
The "Ant Forest" award was awarded the "Incentive and Action" award for the third consecutive year after the Green Innovation Project from China, the Green Innovation Project from China, the "Incentive and Action" award was awarded the "Incentive and Action" award for the third consecutive year.
Trade friction affects the US economy's report card.
The US economy report card for the second quarter of this year shows that the growth rate of GDP in the United States is significantly slower than last quarter, affected by a sharp decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts have pointed out that economic and trade frictions and their uncertainty are the main causes of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revision data published by the United States Department of Commerce on 26th day show that US GDP grew by 2% per year in the second quarter, which was the same as previously published, but significantly below 3.1% in the first quarter.
Data show that consumption growth has become a major factor in supporting economic growth in the United States in the second quarter.
The share of personal consumption spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the United States economy, increased by 4.6 per cent during the season, pulling 3.03 percentage points of economic growth.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment boosted 0.82 percentage points of economic growth.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter declined by 6.3 per cent compared to the previous quarter, slowing down 1.16 percentage points for economic growth during the current quarter; exports declined by 5.7% from the previous quarter, net exports dragged 0.68 percentage points for economic growth during the current season.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of the United States Macroeconomic Consulting Company, stated that private sector investment not only did private sector investment not only maintain the momentum of last year's growth, but had declined significantly, as economic and trade friction and uncertainty had hit business confidence.
Knap believes that next year, with policy uncertainty, US corporate capital spending is expected to remain declining next year.
Analysts believe that while consumption growth has been strongly supported by the United States economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that economic and trade frictions and their uncertainty have affected consumer confidence and have had a negative impact on the United States consumption prospects.
The head of the investigation, Richard Cortin, Professor of Economics at Michigan University, recently stated that 38 per cent of consumers in the last survey referred to the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, a proportion that was a new high in the United States economy in a year and a half.
For future economic trends in the United States, analysts generally believe that the US economy will continue to slow down.
However, experts have also indicated that if economic and trade frictions are mitigated, the performance of the industrial sector and financial markets in the United States will improve.
The global economist Karin Burch of the British Economist think tank predicts that the future of the United States economy will continue its gradual decline since this year, increasing to lower than the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody Analysis, predicts that, with the assumption that economic and trade frictions will not continue to upgrade, the US economy will grow at 2.3% this year, and will slow further to 1.6% next year.
Ellen Hatchen, the investment manager of Patnan Investment, pointed out that the biggest concern of the current enterprise was economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they brought, and that if economic and trade disputes were resolved, uncertainty would be significantly reduced and the industrial sector would be much better performing than it is now.
The Miller-Tabak Asset Management Stock Strategyr Matt Meryl said that economic and trade friction remained a " primary problem " and was the main cause of significant volatility in the United States capital market this year, and whether economic and trade frictions would be key to affecting the future of the United States capital market for the rest of the year.

Minister of Finance Liu Kun: 67 Zong and financial institutions have been transferred to $801 billion in social security funds.
Minister of Finance Liu Kun stated on 27 December that 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions had completed the transfer of some State-owned capital-rich social security funds, totalling approximately 8601 billion yuan.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the National Transfer of Social Security, jointly organized by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Finance Commission to strengthen the work of the Social Security Fund.
" The transfer of some State-owned capital-rich social security funds is an important initiative to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system and is a full expression of intergenerational equity in the development of State-owned enterprises and a long-term policy measure ... "
In 2017, the State Council issued the " Social Security Fund Implementation Programme for the Transfer of Some State Capital Enrichment " , requiring the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to pilot them.
According to Liu Kun, the transfer has been positive.
At the central level, three groups of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred to total State capital of approximately 8601 billion.
Of these, the transfer of central financial institutions with the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance has been largely completed.
Central enterprise transfer has a certain scale.
At the local level, the forward period of enterprise transfer is carried out.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work of the two provinces of Zhejiang, Yunnan, had been largely completed, with a transfer of $15.8 billion and 1.8 billion yuan, respectively.
In addition to pilot provinces, other provinces have undertaken pre-referral preparations, which laid the foundation for the next shift.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the National Council, the General Tax Administration, the SEC issued a joint notice that the central and local transfer of some State-owned capital replenishment funds were fully pushed in 2019 and were largely completed by 2020.
The meeting held on that day provided specific deployments for the full roll-out.
The meeting stressed the need for practical and efficient completion of the transfer ...
" In accordance with the schedule, the transfer will be largely completed by 2020 ...
The shift of working hours is tight and the task is heavy ... "
Liu Kun said that departments should organize and organize carefully and carefully to ensure that the transfer is completed as required; solid advance work and accurately capture the transfer policy content; enhance communication coordination and timely resolution of the problem of difficulties.
The National Fund for the Transfer of Social Security -- from the beginning of the Full Social Security Fund Money Bag, the destination is to provide strong support for pension security.
But I think it's not a simple "physical shift" of equity, but a "mathematic addition."
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Welfare, the National Finance Committee, the General Directorate of Taxes, the SEC jointly issued a " Circular on the full roll-out of some State capital-rich social security funds " , clarifying the timetable for the transfer of State-owned social security funds, namely, central and local capital-rich social security funds, which were fully launched in 2019.
After the document was published, the Treasury Department and others were implemented quickly.
On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10 per cent of the shares held by business banks, agricultural banks, to the Social Security Fund, which was transferred to the total value of over $11.5 billion.
According to the regulations, such as the Social Security Foundation, which is subject to financial investors, has the right to gain, disposal and the right to know.
In its bulletin, the industry stated in its bulletin that this change in interest does not lead to changes in shareholders and actual controllers in the Bank.
In response, I believe that similar State equity transfers are not a simple change in equity belonging, but rather a "plus operation" that can stimulate a series of effects.
The first step of the transfer of social security in some countries, "plus results " , can naturally reflect the universal ownership of state-owned enterprises and the development results of the development.
After years of reform and development, state enterprises, especially Zong, are mostly in important industries and areas in our economy, with a strong and stable overall profitability.
Among them, the lead company continues to be a great man.
On 10 July, the Standing Meeting of the State Council decided that this year the transfer of some State-owned capital was fully transferred to the work of the Social Security Fund.
The Ministry of Finance then stated that, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Meeting of the State Council, a comprehensive push of the transfer of some State-owned capital to fully reflect the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the development of State-owned enterprises.
The second step of the shift, plus the result, is to enhance the sustainability of our social security fund and to further build the foundation of the pension social security system.
With the ageing of the population, our social security funds are under pressure, and this time, as the subject of the transfer, is mostly profitable and red, not only effectively supplementing the social security fund, but also provides social security funds with source water for the Social Security Fund.
It is measured that each State-owned capital that transfers 3.8 percentage points can support the reduction in the share of basic pension insurance in enterprises by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the shift, plus the result, is to increase the stabilizer for capital markets.
This transfer to the subject is to obtain the proceeds by "red, operational " .
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor in State-owned capital, is indeed based on the share-sharing gains.
However, the Social Security Fund, as a value investor in capital markets, has a strong capital operational capacity.
For listed assets in State-owned capital, the participation of the Social Security Fund in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which will contribute to upgrading business levels and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund, as a wind-oriented investment target, has contributed to further enhancing its influence in the market and as a "stabilizer" in the market.
In addition, it also helps to fully perform the "value discovery" function of institutional investors, leading investors to rational investment, value investment.

The first 45 Apollos, developed jointly with a red flag, the "Red Flag EV" Robotaxi fleet, began to be piloted in the long sand section.
From that date, ordinary Changsha citizens will be able to apply for seed users and have the opportunity to test the experience.
One of the passengers who experienced said he was sitting in the back row of the car, clicking on the front screen of the passenger seat, and then turned on the autopilot trip.
In the vehicle, for the safety of passengers and current policy regulations, the pilot vehicle is equipped with a security officer at the driver's position to maximize passenger safety.
During the course of the journey, vehicles can be intelligently modified according to road conditions, and can also judge the situation of the surrounding vehicles and make automatic avoidance of near-range overcars, etc.
In the course of the journey, the passenger area screen shows the roadwalkers, cars, even some traditional blind areas in real time.
Even if the vehicle is covered, we can see information about the changes in the front of the red and green lights and waiting time, and all the traffic is clear.
The drone has heard of it on TV before, thinking it's far away from us, but today it's amazing to find it in our lives.
We expect it to really get into the lives of the people in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo obtained 45 manable test plates issued by the Changsha City.
Currently, the autopilot test in Changsha is open, passing through the city of Changsha City, the city of Artificial Intelligence Technology, Lake May Creek, the Yang Lake, the Great Wangshan, the High New Zone, which is 135 km long, with a demonstration area of 70 square kilometres, the largest, the most complex coverage of the scene, and the most advanced smart driving demonstration area in China.

"We told the team to focus, and when the attack is not in place, we're going to adjust the attack and we're gonna fight each other against each other."

It's safe overseas. It's always a matter of love.
According to Choi Emin, the number of Chinese citizens "go out" has increased dramatically over 70 years, from "less than millions per year" before reform and opening up to hundreds of millions of people today; at the same time, Chinese citizens are safer abroad, and consular protection and assistance have expanded from overseas Chinese nationals to groups such as Chinese nationals, tourists, students, workers, etc.
According to statistics, since the 18th anniversary of the party, we have organized more than 10 major withdrawals or transfers of Chinese citizens abroad to safely evacuate more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
About 500,000 cases were received and coordinated, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In dangerous times, the country can take you home; I want to go on a trip, and now it's no longer a dream.
According to Choi Ai-min, by the end of August this year, China had concluded mutual visa-free agreements with 14 countries covering ordinary passport personnel.
In addition, an increasing number of countries have granted entry facilities such as visa exemption or landing visas by Chinese citizens.
42 countries and territories, including Thailand, Egypt, have unilateral granted a visa for the landing of Chinese citizens with ordinary passports, while 15 other countries and territories, including Indonesia, are allowed to enter the country without a visa.
In addition to visa exemption, landing, etc., Chinese citizens are becoming easier to apply for visas and more simplified procedures.
By the end of August, China had entered into a simplified visa agreement or arrangement with 41 countries.
These include the agreement with the United States, Canada, Israel, Argentina for tourism, and 10 years of valid multiple visas for business personnel, and multiple visa arrangements with the United Kingdom for travel, business, family visitors, etc.
In the United Kingdom, Belgium jointly launched a visa one-stop service, which reduced visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who often leave the country, multiple entry and easy clearance APEC business travel cards are a good option.
According to Choi Emin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining multiple visas for 16 economies around Asia and the Pacific, which is important for business personnel, especially private business personnel.
China is currently the top of the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa mutual agreements and promote more country visa facilitation measures against Chinese citizens, making the results of diplomatic work more transformed into a gratia people ' s initiative and to continuously increase the " gold content " of Chinese passports.

According to the National Electricity Network, the power transmission distance from the project to the south is 3324 km.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15 per cent of electricity will be lost on the way, while the project is developed and developed to increase the economic transport distance significantly to over 3,000 kilometres.
After the launch of the project, 100 million degrees of electricity can be delivered every 8 hours and 20 minutes to help break the problem of the new energy available in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, the annual transmission of electricity on this line will reach 60 to 85 billion kilowatt hours, which will satisfy more than half of Shanghai ' s electricity throughout the year.
The Suton GIL complex is a control project across the Yangtze River.
If you use a regular empty line across the river, two giant towers above 450 meters on the Yangtze River and build an artificial island of over four football fields for each tower.
In this regard, the national grid has been boldly innovative and has developed compact, high-pressure communication GIL transmission technology, which has avoided the impact on gold lanes through tunnels through tunnels.
Two projects have led to a new leap in the manufacturing capacity of our electrician equipment.

New regulations for advice: social capital requires qualifications for rural land operations
Social capital requires qualifications for rural land operations
Public consultation on the "Rural Land Business Transfer Management Approach" to regulate social capital flows such as business enterprises
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development website published a public consultation on the " Rural Land Operating Authority Transfer Management Approach (Revised Draft Draft) " (hereinafter referred to as " the draft comment " ) to increase regulation and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital flows such as business enterprises.
The draft of opinion is now open to society.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, in order to implement the newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act, further consolidate and improve the basic rural business system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, implement the "three-power division" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development revised the Management of the Management of Rural Land Contracting Power Transfers, which resulted in a "advisory draft " .
The Beijing Youth Reporter learned that the first release of the "views" was a number of important changes.
The newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act identifies the scope of land flows and implements the concept of "three-power separation" and the special section sets up "land contracting rights" and "land business rights " , and makes a clear distinction between land contracting and transfer of land operations (rent, transfer, transfer of shares or other means).
In this draft of opinion, in order to implement the concept of "triple-power division", effectively respond to the main thrust of the Rural Land Contracting Act, and taking into account the wide difference between land operations and the exchange of land contracting rights, transfer in terms of parties, procedures, regulation, etc., which defines the scope of the flow, focusing on land operations flows, including rental, entry, etc., by changing the name of the regulation by the "Rural Land Contracting Authority Authority Transfer Management" to "Rural Land Contracting Authority Transfer Management Scheme".
For the transfer of land contracting rights, swaps will provide for separate management approaches.
The "Views" states that in the context of the "triple-power division", farmers are only the right to operate land for a certain period of time.
In theory, even if insolvency occurs, farmers are at risk of losing a certain period of business rights and therefore provides that the contract return to the original contractor is no longer legally unnecessary and conflict with the insolvency law.
In response to the prevention of the risk of land loss of farmers, priority shares have been created in practice, after-leases, buybacks, etc.
Taking into account the more mature theory of priority shares in corporate law, it is suggested that it be used as an advocacy provision for the prevention of risk of loss of shares.
