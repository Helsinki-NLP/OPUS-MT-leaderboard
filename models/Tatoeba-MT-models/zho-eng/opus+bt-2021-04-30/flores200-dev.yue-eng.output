_ When used for hundreds of hours, the lights in the bulb will eventually burn down so the bulb can no longer be used.
Then the bulb needs to be changed.
First of all, there is a need to turn off the lights or cut the wire connection.
This is because if you touch the bottom of part of the metal inside the plug or the bulb still contact the socket, the current that flows into the socket (i.e., the location of the connecting part of the bulb metal) can cause you to have serious electrical contact.

c) In order to reach a certain focal length, the deficiency of the focus lens is that the complexity of the focus and the requirement of the number of elements of the lens is higher.
This has gradually become unproblematic, as mirror producers have been able to produce higher-water mirrors.
This allows the mutinous lens to take a picture of a quality that is comparable to that of a focus lens.
The other flaw in the muscular lens is that the largest radial (velocity) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes cheap modulation lenses difficult to use in low-light environments and without flashlights.
