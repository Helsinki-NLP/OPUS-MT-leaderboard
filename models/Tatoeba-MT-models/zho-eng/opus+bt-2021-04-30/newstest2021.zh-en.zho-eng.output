This year's 34-year-old Zhang Yu's family is in Orchard Village, Sichuan Meishan City, where he quit Beijing's monthly salary of 10,000 jobs to start a business back home in 2010.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after several years of struggle, he now operates a grape-growing family farm that earns more than a million dollars a year, becomes a small, well-known leader of wealth and is also selected into the village's "Two Commissions" squad.
In recent years, inspired by a series of agricultural policies such as national poverty alleviation, rural revitalization and so forth, more and more good peasant workers like Zhang Hsiung chose to return to their homes to start a business and activate a pool of spring water in the country.
In the western part of the country's population province, Sichuan, the labour-exporting province, which has led to the implementation of the "Best Farmer Worker Returning to Cultivation Project", in 2019 alone produced more than 8,000 village branch clerks, raised village reserve strength of 61,000 and development party members of more than 20,000, providing strong guarantees for the fight against poverty and the implementation of a rural revitalization strategy.
It's important to look at the country.
Since the opening of the reform, a large number of our country's rural young and adult labour force has increased their earnings from work, some of which have started their own businesses by cluttering.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If elements such as rural talent continue to flow one way to the city, the country is in a "blood loss" "anemia" for a long time, and revitalization is an empty word.
To attract back farmers who are capable, conscious, and interested in serving their homeland, to guide them back home to start up their businesses as leaders of wealth, from which merit is chosen to form party members, village cadres, and to enrich the cadres at the grass-roots level, which is the solution to the problem of poorness in the ranks of rural and grass-roots parties.
Good peasant workers can be drawn back, and they'll be able to stay, and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has started with the hard-hitting of the Peasant Labour Party by establishing, on the basis of strict criteria for selection, institutional mechanisms such as orientation, service security, training and selection and use, so that they can be empowered, secure at work, hopeful at life, and truly rooted in rural areas, with a sense of success in entrepreneurship among officers.
This year is the year of a strong receiver, ready to fight against poverty and to connect with rural revitalization, and talent is a key factor.
The party councils at all levels need to give high priority to the group of good returning peasant workers and, through integrated measures, to create a team that can stay, fight, take no steps, force forces, and provide strong organizational security and talent support for rural recovery from poverty and development.

The natural ecology of the capital continues to be good and attracts wildlife cities "settling."
There are over 500 species of wildlife in Beijing.
This newspaper (journalist Wang Bin) Beijing Youth Reporter has been informed by the Greening Bureau of the City Gardens that in recent years, as the natural ecological environment of the capital has continued to improve, the variety and number of wildlife has continued to increase.
Currently, terrestrial vertebrate wildlife living in Beijing has increased to over 500 species, including brown horse chickens, black storks and other state-level protected animals, as well as state-level protected animals such as antelopes, large swans, ash cranes, and quails.

In the end of 2019, in a green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, the head of the National Nature Reserve Administration of Matsuyama, who lived in 178 wildlife species, including the protection of animal gold sculptures at the national level and the protection of animal spoon chickens at the national level, and antelopes, were able to see traces of nearly a third of the wildlife species in the city.
"In Pine Mountain, wildlife is the true 'owner', and our staff can at best be a 'guardman' to others. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . in order to get a real picture of wildlife in the protected area, Hu . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"In the course of the tour, not only the recording of biodiversity, but also the installation of artificial bird nests, the rescue of injured wildlife, the installation of field infrared cameras, etc. "
The Pine Mountain National Nature Reserve has now installed more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living state of wildlife in the forest.

Zhang Zhi Minh, Chief of the Wildlife and Wetlands Conservation Branch of the Beijing City Gardens Greening Board, described the increase in terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 today, and the continuous increase in wildlife species and numbers in Beijing in recent years.
The image of wildlife in the city is becoming more common and is closely related to the rising greening of capital cities in recent years.
In particular, the construction of a new million-acre afforestation greening, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecosystem, upgrade the ecological function of the greenlands of the woodlands, and highlight the concept of "near nature".

I'm committed to helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are a lot of ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.
Given this scenario, a modern computer visual algorithm, can tell you that there's a woman, and there's a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It can even tell you that this dog is very cute.
I deal with this and think about how humans understand and live with the world.
Those thoughts, memories and stories in a scene like this, may draw human attention.
The interlinkage of related situations.
Maybe you've seen a dog like this before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this, and you've raised memories and ideas of past holidays, spending time on going to the beach with other dogs, running around.
One of my guiding principles is by helping computers to understand what it's like to understand what we believe and feel in common, and then we have the ability to begin to develop computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
So, dig deep into this, a few years ago I started working to help computers produce human-like stories, from image sequences.
So, one day, when I was working with a computer, I asked about its views on the trip to Australia.
It looked at the picture and saw a bag bear.
It doesn't know what a bag bear is, but the computer says it thinks a bag bear looks like a funny creature.
Then I shared a series of images with the computer about the burning of the house.
The computer looked at the picture and it said, "It's an amazing landscape!
It makes my spinal back cold.
The computer sees a terrible event that changes life and destroys life and thinks it's a positive thing.
I realize that computers recognize the red and yellow contrast, and think it's something to be positively evaluated.
Part of it's because most of the computer I entered was positive images.
That's because when people talk about their experiences, they tend to share positive images.
When was the last time you saw a self-portrait at a funeral?
I realize that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, it's task-to-task, dataset-to-data set, in computer understanding, creating huge gaps, flaws and blind spots.
While doing so, I'm encoded for all sorts of prejudices.
Prejudices reflect a limited view, derived from a data set -- which reflects the same of human beings, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
I recall that technological development, which brought me to the position I was in that day -- the first color image was calibrated to the skin color of a white woman, which meant that color photography was biased against the black face.
And the same deviation, that blind spot went on to bring in the '90s.
The same blind spots, even today, still exist in the application of facial recognition techniques, how to identify the faces of different characters.
In today's study, I think of state-of-the-art technology that tends to limit our ideas to a data set and a question.
And in doing so, we are creating more blind spots and prejudices that will be further amplified when artificial intelligence is used.
And then I realized that we had to think about how we invented the technology today, and how it would be seen in five to ten years.
In human interaction with the environment, humans use time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is developing at an incredible rate.
It means it's really important, and we need to think about it now -- reflect on our own blind spots, and prejudices, and consider how these prejudices affect the technology we're creating now, and discuss what today's technology means to the future.
CEOs and scientists, have weighed their ideas, about future artificial intelligence development.
Stephen Hawking warned, " Artificial intelligence will kill humanity. "
Elon Mask warns that this is a present risk and one of the greatest risks we face as a civilized society.
And Bill Gates said, "I don't understand why people aren't more worried about artificial intelligence."
But these views -- they're just part of the story.
That math, models, the basic components of these artificial intelligences, we can all access and use.
We have source code tools that are open to the public to learn about machines and to make our own contributions at the same time.
Besides, we can share our experiences.
We can share the technology and its relationship with us, and the places where we can leap.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, which may be more beneficial in terms of technology, or more problems may arise over time.
If we all focus on opening up discussion of artificial intelligence and looking to the future, it will help create a conventional dialogue and consciousness about what artificial intelligence is, what can it be, and everything we need to do to achieve the results that best suit us.
We've seen and understood this in the technology we're using today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and auto vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they good?
Yeah, so are they.
They're not exactly the same.
There you've seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to start with what we're building and creating now.
We activated the domino effect, which opens the evolutionary pathway of artificial intelligence.
In our time, we shaped tomorrow's artificial intelligence.
Let us be immersed in the technology that strengthens reality and revives the world of the past.
When people have trouble communicating, technology helps them share their experiences.
The technology established in the online visual media can be used for auto-drive in cars.
Technology, based on image understanding, produces language that can evolve into technology to assist people with visual impairments, helping them to better own the visual world.
We also see how technology leads to some problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth -- the color of our skin or the expression on our faces to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, to process data on gender or race, to determine whether we can get a loan.
Everything we see now, it's just a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now, it's a moment of evolution.
This means that what we're doing now will influence the way things are going, and extend to the future world.
If we want artificial intelligence to help humans evolve in a way, we need to set strategies and targets, and open that path immediately.
What I want to see is the direction of culture and environment appropriate to humans.
Technology can help us heal people with nervous system diseases or other disabilities, making them as challenging as everyone else.
The operation of technology doesn't take into account your characteristics or skin color.
I'm concerned today about tomorrow and 10 years later technology.
- Artificial intelligence can appear in many different ways.
But in this case, it's not an unmanned car with no destination.
This is a car we can drive under control at the same time.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.
We choose if we need to turn.
We choose what an artificial intelligence will be in the future.
There will be a vast arena where artificial intelligence can be everything.
It'll turn into a lot of different things.
It's up to us to figure out what needs to be done to make sure that the result of artificial intelligence is better for all humans.
Thank you.

Xinhua Harbin, July 26, Question: Black Land "Species" Out of Agriculture Modernization
In the summer, two jets of spraying agents were looted from the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration field at the second operating station of the Friendship Farm Division V, forming two white lines, and the green field was particularly visible with the "first-ever" large words of black rice seeded in the green field.
This station, long hole, said that such aircraft could spray agents on more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, about eight times more efficient than drones and hundreds of times more artificial.
This farm is located within Friendship County, Heilongjiang Province, the country's first grain-producing province, and runs from the sound of past rice cuttings to the sound of Mada, which is now "Longlong", where traditional Chinese farming and farms are undergoing change on this black earth.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . On the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precision fertilization, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can increase the standard operating level in the field of agricultural machinery.
In rice production this year, the farm expanded the operational area of satellite navigation unmanned plug-in technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes the planting of seedlings more even, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources and saves $16 per acre of manual costs.
The farm tried new technologies such as information, intelligence in agricultural production, which formed the largest agricultural machinery in the country, from the ground to the sky.
The total holdings of farm machinery are currently 49,000 units (in pieces), with an integrated mechanization rate of 99.8 per cent in the field.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"Green agriculture, intelligent agriculture, and digital agriculture are the direction of agricultural modernization ... "
The head of the friendly farm, Liu Zilian, said.
The key to the modernization of agriculture is progress in science and technology.
In recent years, the farming of the Heilongjiang, represented by the farm, has played a leading role in the demonstration of modern large-scale agriculture, the carrier, and in the initial establishment of a modern agricultural industrial system dominated by scale cultivation, standardized production, and industrialization.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in the suburbs of Friendship County. . . . .
Here's a collection of more than 140 farm tools that have been introduced and used by Heilongjiang farming for many years.
These farm tools and farms bear witness to the process of the modernization of our agriculture.

"I got a call from the village officials for the transfer, and I'm still mopping up in the field. "
Fou Qungbao said that he had passed more than 60 acres, planted rice, and had a good look at it, " yesterday he was drugged, tools and nothing was packed. "
Fou Qungbao points to the pesticide sprayer in the corner, " Nobody wants their homes flooded, let's go to the house for everyone. "
In response to the continued high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in the nave lake, the city of Fatty, Anhui Province, is preparing to open the Chiangkou River Union reservoir, where Fu Qungbao's family lives, on 26 days.
The Chiangkou River Union is located in Fatsy County and is adjacent to the lake embankment of the nest.

At 1600 hours on 25th, the fifth largest freshwater lake in the country remained at a height of 13.2 m, exceeding the guaranteed water level of 0.7 m.
The kitchen of the Fu Qungbao family was clean and clean, with a pot of pumpkin headbread on the table, eggs and some halogen in the fridge.
"Unexpected to move, the water of Chiangkou is now looking good."
Zhou Yan said that the house was a flat and that some big objects had not yet been decided where to put them.
" Pack the valuables first, refrigerators, television sets, and these big items can be placed in high-lying neighbors or relatives ' homes for the time being. "
The village's cadre, Wang Ri, made an idea for Fu Quinbao.
. Wang was in charge of the relocation of 13 villagers, and one family notified the identification of everyone's resettlement programme.
The nearest settlement to the Fu Qungbao family is the Su Elementary School, a two-kilometre roadway.
In addition to the large items, Fou Qungbao's head hurts with more than 1,000 pounds of food and some of the newly purchased furniture in the family.
"The food is ready to be dragged to the relatives, and the furniture can't be moved."
The couple talked about putting a bench under the newly bought bed and raising the bed by about half a metre.
At 6 p.m., Fu Qungbao began shipping things to relatives in a tricycle, and Zhou Yan went on to pack them at home.
At more than 11:00 p.m., the couple looked back and forth at the house, pulled the electric switch and was ready to go to the settlement.
"I hope the water will retreat early."
Says Fu Qungbao.
At 9:30 a.m. on 26 July, journalists saw on the Chiangkou River Union site that local preparations had been made for the distribution of the flood.

. . . . . . . . . . on 26 local time, Nanter Public Prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer who was in charge of defending the cathedral had been indicted for "the arson destruction".
He has admitted it was himself who set the fire in the church.
According to reports, the local prosecutor, Senas, said that the 39-year-old, parish volunteer from Rwanda, admitted that he had set fire to three of the cathedrals at night.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The man entered France a few years ago by way of asylum, was granted asylum in the parish where the fire took place and was admitted to the church.
The prosecution noted that he had recently tried to update the visa and was engaging in dialogue with the police station on this.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On the day of the fire on 18 July, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police for a lack of logic in his account, but he was later released.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On the evening of the 25th, the man was again summoned as a result of the acquisition of new evidence by professional engineers at the Paris Central Police Laboratory.
This time, the man confessed to his arson.
The suspect is reported to face 10 years' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros if the crime of vandalism is committed with intent to arson.
The fire reportedly caused serious damage to St. Pierre and St. Paul Cathedral, the organ inside the church was completely burned down and the glass windows behind the organ were badly damaged.
The chief architect of the French historical preservation architecture, Brunet, believes that conservative estimates suggest that the restoration of the Nant Cathedral takes at least three years.
Comprehensive message: U.S. unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries, and international public opinion supports China's anti-US-Sinhua network
On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Office informed the United States Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its permit for the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and made a specific request to the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion is of the view that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States have seriously troubled the relations between China and the United States, and that China has responded to the unjustified provocations of the American side and that it is legitimate and necessary to take counter-measures.
The Director of the Chinese Research Centre of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, Andrés Borges, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States had destroyed the bridges of understanding between the peoples of China and the United States and had put the relations between the two great Powers in crisis.
China has informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate-General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures taken by the United States and is in accordance with diplomatic practice.
The above-mentioned decision by the Director of the Centre for Académie Studies, Patricio Justo, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina, believes that the Chinese side is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the earlier provocations of the United States, and is not directed against the ordinary American population.
The United States tried to distract the American public by pressuring China to achieve its goal of concealing its failure to respond to the new coronae outbreak.
The Chairman of the Asian Center for Innovation Studies in Indonesia, Bambang Suryono, said that the provocative diplomatic gesture of the United States had seriously troubled relations between China and the United States, which faced serious challenges.
China informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate-General in Chengdu was a normal countermeasure and was in line with diplomatic practice, reflecting both China's principled position of determined defence of its own interests and China's legitimate and well-founded diplomacy.
The Tanzanian current affairs commentator, Francis Semwanza, said that the above-mentioned decision by China was a legitimate and necessary response to the provocations of the United States.
In order to restore normal relations between China and the United States, the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to win economically and politically with China and how to benefit both peoples and the international community as a whole.
The Executive Director of the Sudanese-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, Ali Yusuf, said that the counter-measures that China had been forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified actions of the American side, in accordance with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as with diplomatic practice.
before the American side called for the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston to be a serious violation of international law and basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the American side will reverse the previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the normalization of relations between the two countries.
The Singapore United Morning Post published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intent of the United States was to block China and prevent it from continuing to rise.
In the face of the tight pace in the United States, China, while reluctant to see that relations between China and the United States continue to deteriorate, has had to take counter-measures.

On July 26, the Xinhua news agency Guangzhou (journalist Mao) journalist learned from the Guangdong Sea Police that in recent days, the Bureau, in association with Guangzhou Customs, the public security department, had eliminated a mega-smuggling group of manufactured oil, which had initially verified that it had smuggled about 120,000 tons of finished oil, worth about 800 million yuan, and had stolen about 240 million yuan since 2019.
The Guangdong Sea Police, in conjunction with the Customs Department, gradually map the division of labour and organizational structure of the group.
On 8 July, the naval police, customs and public security departments conducted a unified network operation in Guangzhou, Foshan and the Pearl River Junction area, where four suspected smuggled ships were seized on site, bringing the total to 4,700 tons of finished oil seized by the vessels and the oil depots involved, respectively, and a number of funds accounts were frozen.
It is understood that this joint operation involved eight ships and two helicopters, divided into multiple operational teams to work in concert to conduct a full chain of attacks on the maritime smuggling, land-based illegal operations and the arrival of all 35 major suspects.
The case is currently under further investigation.
The relevant officials of the Guangdong Sea Police Department have said that they will continue to maintain high pressure in the future to combat all types of smuggling offences at sea and to maintain good order in the waters of the jurisdiction.

Poland will withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women
The Polish Ministry of Justice said on Saturday that Poland would take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The Polish right-wing government cabinet stated that the treaty required schools to teach students about gender issues, trampling on the rights of the students ' parents.
The Polish Minister of Justice, Giablo, held a press conference and said that on Monday his Ministry of Justice would submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family to start withdrawing from the treaty.
The treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
" The treaty contains elements of a morphological nature that we consider to be harmful. "
The Polish governing law has a close alliance with the Justice Party and its governing coalition partners with the Roman Catholic Church, advocating a conservative social agenda.
The Polish President Duda made hostile homosexual rights one of the main topics during this month's successful re-election campaign.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, held protests against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
One of the organizers of the protest, Lempat, said in a protest march in Warsaw that "the purpose of withdrawal from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence."
Some protesters carried banners, which read "The hell of women in the Law and Justice Party."
The Law and Justice Party has been complaining about the Istanbul Convention for a long time.
The Convention was ratified by Poland ' s previous centrist government in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government stated that the treaty did not respect religion and called for the teaching of liberal social policies in schools.

Jiangxi has opened a "green channel" for youth on the front line to fight the floods.
The Conscription Office of the People's Government of Jiangxi Province of Xinhua Nan Chang on 26 July (Kou Dongming, Yong-Lang) recently made it clear that individuals or their children who had been prominent in this flood relief mission were eligible for recruitment and medical examinations, political examinations were qualified, and priority soldiers were given.
" After the registration of the young recruits, we will jointly enlist the youths in their communities, the Street Armed Forces and the Conscription Office of the Zhongyang District to give priority to the recruitment of soldiers ... "
The Deputy Minister of Wu Wang Hui, the deputy minister of Xinyang District in Kyushu City, said that, as a result of the floods, they had been organizing a youth medical examination for three days, starting from the 25th day.

Between now and the end of 2020, the province of Kitajiang will have the necessary conditions, especially in the areas of infrastructure, human resources and land, to proactively attract inflows of foreign investment, especially transnational groups with value chains and the transfer of advanced technologies.
In addition, the province of Kitajiang will be ready to submit to the Prime Minister of the Government a decision to invest in infrastructure development and operation projects in the Vietnamese industrial zone and to approve the addition of the two industrial-city-service areas of Anshan-Northang and Anjiang Province to the overall plan for the development of Viet Nam industrial district by 2020.
At the same time, the province of Kitajiang is investing in accelerating the pace of projects, particularly infrastructure-building and business projects for clusters of industrial parks such as Fuu, Guangzhou, and Twin Creek-Nei-Kyoon, to form a land fund for hiring.
In 2020, the North Jiang Province Bureau of Trade and Industry participated in the establishment of industrial zones and industrial cluster planning to provide advice for inclusion in provincial planning.
The province of Kitajiang has determined to combine the development of industrial park clusters with defence security, protection of the ecological environment and food security, thereby contributing to the balanced development of industry; with comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water, transport and telecommunications; and with other social infrastructure such as city-building, trade services, workers ' housing and health care, and education.
In the industrial zone, the province of Kitajiang has focused on calling for investment projects in high-tech, clean technologies in such areas as electricity, electronics, telecommunications equipment, sophisticated machinery, support industries, etc.
In the industrial park cluster, the province calls for small and medium-sized investment projects in production, utilizing local labour, especially in the areas of agricultural products, food processing and so on.
In the future, the province of Kitajiang will focus on accelerating investment in the infrastructure of the Kitajiang logistics centre, developing in parallel with the clusters of industrial parks in order to optimize goods, currency flows and help reduce production costs, improve the value of goods, optimize supply chains and develop multimodal transport, thereby creating an attraction for investors to invest in the province.
Upgrade of Russian helicopter gunship card-52M for the first time out of the factory - Xinhua Network at the end of the year
On July 25, Xinhua Moscow, according to plans of the Russian Ministry of Defence, the upgrade of the Russian helicopter gunships (hereinafter Wu Nai) card-52 — the card-52M will be completed for the first time in December of this year to replace and leave the plant, and the aircraft will be significantly upgraded in terms of reconnaissance, communications and weapons performance.
According to Russian News, the development contract for Wu Naika-52M, known as the Super Short Kiss Crocodile, was signed last April between the Russian military and military engineering units, and the first two of the upgrades are currently undergoing refitting at the Far East helicopter manufacturing plant of the Russian Progressive Aerospace Group, whose national testing and improvement finish will be completed by October 2022.
According to Russian experts who are aware of the above-mentioned upgrade, "Super short-kissed alligators" — Wu Naika-52, which was officially loaded in November 2011 — the aircraft revealed some weaknesses in its use, and the upgrade was made in order to "fill the panels".
It was reported that, compared to card-52, the card-52M would partially introduce new types of protective materials that would not add weight, and that its pilot cabin would be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of survival on the battlefield; more power-powered generators would be fitted to power more sophisticated on-board electronic equipment; the photovoltaic system would be upgraded to enable reconnaissance and identification of more distant battlefield targets; new light-use missiles with major attack on armoured combat vehicles and concrete fortifications would have a range of 20 kilometres, which would increase approximately 1 times the range of similar missiles used in Russian active force; and its defensive weapons and communications equipment would be used to the maximum extent possible with the Mi-28NM armed helicopters that could attack air targets, thus making the associated maintenance simple and economical.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Russian expert also stated that it was of concern that the card-52M would be equipped with communications equipment to communicate with drones, thereby obtaining information from nearby drones in real time in the air, such as displaying images taken by drones on the cabin screen of the helicopter.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Hebei has had 1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological rehydration of the lake since this year - a new and medium-sized network
On July 26, Xinhua Shijia (journalist Wang Quin) journalist learned from Hebei Water Hall that since this year, Hebei Province has implemented ecological rehydration using a combination of 28 rivers such as the River and the local reservoir, and has been running towards the River Zhui, the Tang River, and the Noma River, and White Hays, cumulatively completing 1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological rehydration of the river and lake.
The province of Hebei closely seized the favourable opportunity of the Southern Water Transit Midline Project to increase the flow of water, and implemented ecological refilling of water using rivers such as Tang River, Sand River, and Zilong River.
At the same time, ecological rehydration was implemented using the Western Ocean, nine large and medium reservoirs such as the East Wushu and the White Ocean starling towards the Zhongyang and Qinglong rivers, which accumulated over 90 square kilometres of surface.
In order to do ecological rehydration work, the Water Department of Hebei province has actively organized water rehydration river infestation and drainage, overhauling and river cleaning, fine-tuning of practical measures, and strengthening of surveillance and supervision.
The timely resolution of various problems through supervised inspections and centralized covert visits ensures the safe and orderly recharge of rivers.
According to the relevant head of the Water Department of Hebei Province, the orderly implementation of the ecological recharge of the river and lake has effectively restored the water ecology of the river and lake in Hebei Province, contributed to the restoration and culpability of the coastal groundwater, greatly improved the habitat and economic development environment along the route and was important for achieving the conservation objectives of the "water clear, shore green, river well-off, and simmy" river and lake management.
You should all know the truth I'm going to tell you.
I think the intuition that inequality could cause social division and corruption existed before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the effects of inequality by comparing societies, societies with varying degrees of equality.
I'll show you some data and explain why those data do exist.
But first, let's see how hard our lives are.
I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This figure shows the relationship between our average lifespan and our gross national income -- the latter measure the average wealth of the country.
You can look at those countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, which are twice as rich as those on the left of Israel, Greece, and Portugal.
But that doesn't affect the average life expectancy of their nationals.
There are no signs of a correlation.
But if we go to understand within society, we can find that there are significant differences in health status within their society as a whole.
It's still an average life expectancy.
These are the towns of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There's a big difference between the poor and the others.
Even those who are just below the top, their health is worse than those who are at the top.
So income in our society means very much, but comparisons between different societies don't make sense.
The explanation for that contradiction is that, in our society, we look at relative income or social status, identity -- the interrelationship between us and the size of the gap between people.
Once you have that idea, you should start thinking, "What happens if the gap widens, what happens if the gap is narrowed, and what happens if the income gap is widened or reduced?
That's what I'm about to tell you.
I don't use any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations — as from the World Bank — about the income gap between these rich, developed markets and the democratic countries.
The method we use, simple and easy to understand, and you can download, is to compare the top 20 percent of each country with the bottom 20 percent of the income gap.
You can see that countries on the left are more equal -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- and their first 20% wealth is about 3.5 to 4 times that of the second 20%.
But on the other side of the relative inequality - the United Kingdom, Portugal, the United States, Singapore - the income gap is twice as large.
In this way of comparison, the level of inequality in our country (the United Kingdom) is twice as high as in other equally successful democratic markets.
I'm going to show you what this has done to our society.
We've collected data on problems arising from differences within society, which are more prevalent at the lowest levels of society.
Internationally comparable data include average life expectancy, children's mathematical and linguistic performance, infant mortality rate, suicide rate, percentage of prison population, early pregnancy rate of adolescent girls, level of mutual trust, obesity, mental illness - all of which meet the standard diagnostic classification of drug and alcohol addiction - and social mobility rates.
We put all of this in a coefficient.
They're all weighted on average.
The score of a country is what these factors averagely get.
As you can see, these scores are related to the inequality comparison I've just shown, and I'm going to show these data over and over again.
The more unequal the country, the worse it behaves on a variety of social issues.
It's very relevant.
But if you look at the same health and social issues as the index of per capita national income and gross national income, then you won't find anything, and it's no longer relevant.
We have a little worry that people might think that we're picking specific questions to suit our theory and then artificially creating evidence, so we're also publishing a paper on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index in the British Medical Journal.
It contains 40 different parts, from other people's summaries.
It includes the ability of children to talk to their parents, the availability of books at home, the level of immunization, and the existence of bullying in schools.
It's all covered.
This is the relationship between the index and the same degree of inequality.
In the more unequal societies, the worse the performance of children.
The relationship and its visibility.
But once again, if you look at child welfare in relation to national income per capita, you'll get nothing... no signs of association.
All the data I'm showing you right now reveals is the same thing.
The average welfare of our society is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They're very important in poorer countries, but not for rich developed countries.
And the difference between us and our position vis-à-vis others seems very important today.
I'll show you some of the divisions of our index.
It's a mutual trust index.
It means the proportion of people who agree that most people are credible.
This is the data from the World Values Survey.
As you can see, on the more unequal side, about 15% of people feel they can trust others.
But in a more egalitarian society, the proportion rose to 60% or 65%.
If you look at community participation again, or at the assessment of social capital, there are very similar connections that are closely linked to inequality.
I'd say we repeated this work twice.
And for the first time, in these rich developed countries, we replaced the test, and we repeated the test to 50 states in the United States -- to investigate the same question: are the more unequal states doing worse on all these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality that the federal government has drawn from a general social survey.
Very similar scatterings are distributed on similar levels of trust.
The same thing's going on.
Basically, we found that almost all of the confidence-related factors reflected in the international survey were reflected in the 50 states we surveyed separately.
It's not a coincidence.
This is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization, through random sampling, uses the same diagnostic interview method to gather data that allows us to compare the rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the rate of the population suffering from any kind of mental illness the previous year.
It ranges from 8% to more than 24% - which indicates that the proportion of society as a whole suffering from mental illness is three times as high as that of other societies.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This figure is the crime rate.
The red dots indicate the states of the United States, and the blue triangles indicate the provinces of Canada.
But look at the difference in their numbers.
The murder rate was from 15 to 150 per million.
It's the rate of prison inmates.
It's a 10-fold gap, and the index function widens that gap.
But the range of incarcerations is from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain some of the reasons.
But more severe trials, or harsher trials.
The more unequal society is, the more inclined it is to retain the death penalty.
This is a picture of children dropping out of high school.
Again, there's a big gap.
If we discuss the selection of social talent, we'll find that the danger of this gap is very serious.
This figure is the rate of social mobility.
It's actually an income-based flow rate.
Basically, what it's asking is, do rich dads have rich kids, poor dads have poor kids, or do they have nothing to do with that?
On the more unequal side, Dad's income is even more important -- in the United Kingdom, in the United States, for example.
And in Northern Europe, Dad's income isn't that important.
There's more social movement there.
As we used to say -- I know there's a lot of American listeners here -- if Americans want to realize their American dream, they should go to Denmark.
I've already shown it in italics.
I can also show you some other questions.
Those problems are more prevalent at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are infinity problems with the social gradients, which are worse in unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but just two times worse than ten times worse.
Think of the cost, the cost of manpower.
I'd like to go back to this image that we've shown before, and we combine it all together to illustrate two things.
First, through one chart after another, we find that the less performing countries, whatever they may be, seem to be the more unequal ones, but the well performing ones seem to be the Nordics and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between general social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things went wrong, but almost everything.
Another important point I'd like to point out on this chart is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show in all respects that they're very different countries.
The status of women, their adherence to small families, in rich and developed countries, is at two extremes.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden is very different in terms of income, but it closes the gap with taxes, state benefits, generous relief and so on.
Japan is quite different.
First of all, the Japanese pre-tax wage gap is smaller.
It has lower taxes.
It's also less well-being.
And in the study of the U.S. states, we found a sharp contrast.
There are some states that are doing well through redistribution, while others are doing well because of the small pre-tax income gap.
So we conclude that it's not important to achieve greater equality, it's important to be able to achieve that equality.
I'm not talking about full equality, all I'm talking about is actually in rich developed-market democracies.
Another unexpected thing about this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
The words of John Dorn (British poet) seem to make sense: " No one is an island. "
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behaviour of people of every social class in different countries that are more or less equal.
It's just an example.
This figure is the infant mortality rate.
According to the general socio-economic classification record in the United Kingdom, some Swedes are very kind in classifying many infant deaths.
It's an anachronistic classification based on fatherhood, so single mothers make up a set of data.
But we're looking at what's called the "low class of society," which is a hand job that doesn't require technology.
The middle is skilled manual work, then advanced non-hand work, up to professional work -- doctors, lawyers, managers of big companies.
Here you can see that Sweden is doing better than Britain, doing better in every social class.
The biggest differences occur at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We showed five different sets of data, including educational outcomes in the United States and internationally, and health status.
It seems that on the whole - more egalitarian societies display the most visible differences at the bottom of society, but there are also advantages at the social level.
I should explain what's going on.
I think I'm showing and discussing the psychological impact of inequality on society.
More attention is paid to the sense of superiority and inferiority, to being valued and despised, to being respected and devalued.
Of course, those feelings that arise from the competition for identity have inspired the advance of social consumerism.
But it also leads to a lack of security in status.
We're more concerned about how people judge and view us, whether we look attractive, smart, or something like that.
Social value assessments reinforce fear of these social value assessments.
Interestingly, some similar work in the area of social psychology is being done as well: some people have consulted 208 different studies; in the study, volunteers are invited to a psychological testing centre and then tested their stress hormones and their reactions in carrying out stress missions.
In this observation, scientists are interested in what kind of pressure is most likely to increase the level of cortisol in the body, the most important of which is Holmon.
The result is precisely those tasks that include social assessment threats -- tasks that threaten self-esteem and social status -- in which others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These pressures have a very special effect on stress physiology.
So far we've accepted the criticism.
Of course, some people don't like this, and others find it surprising.
And yet I should tell you that when people criticize us for picking data, we never do that.
We have an unconditional requirement that if our data sources contain data from the countries observed, then we include it in our analysis.
Our data sources decide whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise, there will be deviations.
What about the rest of the country?
There are 200 studies in academic peer-reviewed journals on the relationship between health and income and equality.
It's not confined to these countries here, hiding a simple proof.
The same country, the same method of measuring inequality, the problems one by one.
Why don't we control other factors?
I've shown you that per capita national income doesn't have any impact.
Of course, others have applied more sophisticated methods in the literature, excluding poverty, education, etc. in the experiment.
What about causality?
. Relevance does not in itself prove causality.
It took us a lot of time.
Indeed, people have a good understanding of the causal connection between our results.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in rich and developed countries is how important it is that long-term stress from society affects the immune system and the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, violence is becoming more common in more unequal countries because people are very sensitive to being despised.
I'd say, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of problems after and before taxes.
We should limit income and curb the top bonus income culture.
I think we have to do everything we can to hold our leaders accountable to our staff.
What I want to conclude is that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
In that case, we'll find out that all of a sudden we've solved the social and mental health problems of society as a whole, and that's great.
Thank you.

In the past two weeks, Spain's new crown cases have risen dramatically, with thousands of new cases occurring over the years.
The British government decided temporarily on the evening of Saturday (25 July) to remove Spain from the security travel list from the area at 00:00 local time, and that persons entering the UK from Spain must be isolated for 14 days.
The British tourists who are on vacation in Spain have heard the decision express surprise, fear, and even anger, as the news is unexpected.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Prior to the release of the British quarantine measures, Norway had also announced a 10-day quarantine for those returning from Spain to Norway.
France and Belgium recommended that their residents abandon their plans for vacations in front of Barcelona and the surrounding areas.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded and social distances cannot be maintained between people, and at one point the police needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach visitors.
Tourism is an important pillar of Spain's industry.
Spain: It's safe here.
In response to the decision taken by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Sunday that the outbreak in the country was under control.
The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Arancha Gonzalez Laya, stressed to the media: " Spain is safe, not only for the Spanish, but also for tourists. "
The Spanish Government will try to convince the British Government to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason for this is that the infection rate in these two tourist resorts is far lower than in mainland England.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Spanish region of Catalonia has also re-established the "Fulfillment Order".
The tourism industry is an important pillar of Spain, which is one of the most favoured resorts for British tourists.
This decision by the United Kingdom is expected to have a significant impact on Spain's tourism industry.

The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency seaworthiness directive on 24 December, requiring an emergency check of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737 NG and 737 Classic airliners registered in the United States, on the grounds that the corrosion of the above-mentioned airliner's air stop valve could lead to engine air parking.
The Federal Aviation Agency said that it had received four reports of 737 NG and 737 Classic passenger engines stopping in the air so far, and had made an urgent inspection request for passenger aircraft parked for seven consecutive days or more and aircraft that had flown less than 11 times to date since they were re-entered.
The Federal Aviation Agency warns that the 5th-degree stop valve of all two engines of the airliner, if all are corroded, may be stuck in the opening position, causing the airliner to lose power completely and not be able to restart the engine.
This aviation regulator ordered that, once the stop valve was found to be corrupted, the air operator must replace this key component before the airliner is put into service again.
The Boeing company responded later in the day that the outbreak of the new coronae outbreak had led to a reduction in the need for travel, and that many passenger aircraft had been sealed or less used, and that the " stop valves were more susceptible to corrosion " .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Associated Press reports that major United States air operators usually fly multiple flights in one day, but that a large number of airliners have stopped after the outbreak of the new coronae outbreak; some have been put back into operation as passenger travel needs have recently grown slowly.
The Federal Aviation Agency did not issue details of four air parking reports.
The Alaska Airlines revealed one of the events later on 24th.
This air operator said in the statement that on July 15, a passenger under the flag was on its way from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, where an engine suddenly went off fire and the passenger eventually made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
The Alaska Airlines said that the engine of the airliner had been replaced and that the engine of the six airliners had been inspected in accordance with the instructions of the Federal Aviation Agency.
The U.S. Airways, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on 24th, respectively, that there were no engine outages of the associated air stop valves.

A Boeing 737MAX airliner from Indonesian Lions Airways and Ethiopian Airways crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing 346 people.
This series of passenger aircraft subsequently ceased to fly globally, it ceased production in January of this year and resumed production in May.

In addition, the show invited Professor of Economics Xue Mupfeng to act as the "knowledge sponsor" of the show, to join the "Ting Tong Helping Teacher" Du Haitao and Jinmong Jia, to chat with viewers about youth and build "All-People's Youth Open".
Head of the Political Affairs Department of the HKSAR Government: The situation is dire.
Zhang Jianzong, Chief Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong, Xinhua, July 26, July 26), said that the New Crown pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong was continuing to be severe and that if the epidemic deteriorates, the Hong Kong Government will decisively take stricter controls to further restrict business operations and reduce public space.
But at this stage, it is not the intention of the D.C. government to introduce a "home order" or a "basket order" to restrict citizens from going out.
On that day, Zhang Jianzong published a weblog entitled "The situation is dire, fight the disease at all".
He said that the outbreak was the worst in six months and that the next two weeks would be critical, and that every effort should be made to prevent further spread of the virus in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the District Government, citizen self-regulation and co-operation are also very important.
He called on citizens to make sure to stay at home as much as possible, to reduce social contact and out-of-home meals.
The citizens should cooperate with the imposition of masks to protect themselves and others, with a focus on personal and environmental health and on hand washing, and should, more importantly, suspend non-necessary family and friends gatherings or gatherings and reduce them to the streets.
He stated that the Centre had been very concerned about the change in the Hong Kong epidemic and had supported the Hong Kong Government's efforts to combat the epidemic, and had responded positively to the Chief Executive's latest request to assist in the expansion of detection capacity and the conversion of the Asian International Expo to work on similar "square" hospitals.
Zhang Jianzong stated that the free viral testing provided by the Government of the District to specific high-risk groups, namely, the Angian Home, the Disability Home and the Nursing Home, the restaurant staff, taxi drivers and property management staff, had been fully implemented, involving up to 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about the cases of infection that occurred in the home, and the Government of the District had arranged specific temporary quarantine centres for the family members of the home.
He said that the Government of the District was building quarantine facilities in the vicinity of the Bay of Bamboo Quarantine Centre, located in Taipei Hill, New Territories, and that it was expected that an additional 700 isolation units would be available by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on 19th that the District Government would build an additional 2,000 isolation houses at the Bay of Bamboo Quarantine Centre and aim to be inaugurated by the end of this year.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There are currently four operating quarantine centres in Hong Kong, providing a total of about 2600 isolation rooms.
In addition, the HKSAR Government reactivated the Carpgate Park Resort, located on Hong Kong Island, as a community quarantine facility for the treatment of patients under the age of 50 with independent self-reliance.
A regular party history, a "nutrient" in the history of New China - China's New Net

History is the best textbook, and for party cadres, party history, New China history, is the most important chapter in this textbook.

A close understanding of party history, important events in the history of New China, important meetings, important figures, not only intuitive mind shock, mind baptism, but also from the depths of the soul, understanding the meaning of the first mind's faith, and knowing the weight of the mission.
For party members' cadres, to continue to struggle for their first mission, and for ever to advance, it is necessary to find out where we left off from the history of the party, the history of the new China, the focus of the first heart, keeping a sense of consciousness and firmness, to provoke the strength of the country's brave struggle for its people, and to ensure that the red Jiangshan generations of revolutionaries pass on with blood and life.

Since the formation of the Communist Party of China, a series of great spiritualities such as the Red Ship Spirit, the Iiokayama Spirit, the Long March Spirit, the Yanan Spirit, the Struggle Spirit, the Sipapo Spirit, the "two-shot one-star" Spirit, and the space spirit have been shaped.
These great spiritualities, which have been deposited in history, provide a strong spiritual incentive for our party to overcome the various risk challenges on the way forward, and are invaluable spiritual wealth that cannot be broken, washed away and taken away.
The process of learning party history, Chinese history, is a process of retrospect and self-spiriting of these spiritualities, consciously mirroring the noble spirit of the revolutionary forebears, holding on to the spiritual homeland of the Communists, building firm spiritual foundations for the advancement of great causes and the realization of great dreams, and rejuvenating these spiritual successions and promotions with a new era of light.

The Yellow River, which has aroused the pride of countless humans, the Red Zhou, has spawned the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plains, and today, the beautiful Ningxia, who has "Seokai Gangnam", is insisting on the idea of "an ecological priority, green development", and is pursuing the poetic dream of the Yellow River.

However, with industrialization, rapid advances in urbanization, imbalance in river and lake development utilization and management protection, over-plained drainage, lake-building, encroachment on waters and so on, the resulting black stench of water, over-standard water quality, environmental disrepair, and ecological degradation.

The water is to be treated from the source.
In Ningxia Sinkuan, the local approach of "lifting + anti-fouling + tightpipes" resulted in the complete centralization of sewage from industrial parks, the full implementation of level I A standard discharge from municipal sewage treatment plants, the basic elimination of black stinking water bodies from urban built-up areas, and the successful declaration of a third batch of Chinese model cities for black stinking water.
In addition, Ningxia fully introduced the river and lake long system in 2017, and has now achieved full coverage of the district city and village five-level river and lake long system of responsibility, with river and lake long cruises becoming normal.

The yellow rivers pass through Ningxia and along the way form a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands, swamp wetlands, and other wetlands, which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water, as well as being an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, Ningxia-related departments have invested cumulatively in wetland conservation projects in the amount of RMB 34.5 billion. Currently, the area of the Sinkuan wetlands is 19.2 million hectares, wetland conservation stands at 78.5 per cent, there are natural lakes, nearly 200 marsh wetlands, with five national wetland parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous wetland parks, and eight municipal parks.
The Deputy Director of the City of Silverkawa Wetlands Conservation Center, Lu Jinhu, told reporters that wetland conservation has increased biodiversity and is particularly evident in birds, "The gulls are an endangered bird, with just over 20,000 birds around the world, of which more than 2,000 are inhabited.

At the same time, Ningxia has legally assigned a red line between the 500-metre zone to the area of wetland protection on both sides of the Yellow River Galactica section, stipulating that no unit or individual shall carry out development construction and business activities within the protected range, except for projects of public interest.
Zhao Xiaoyong, Deputy Director of the Water Service Centre in Silverkawa City, introduced the fact that, through the management of pollution sources, the integrated remediation of the lake's ecology and the construction of the end wetlands, today Ningxia's 9 entries, mainly into the yellow drain ditch, have met 100 per cent of the IV standard, "The water is now clear, the fish are swimming, and the flowers are blooming. "
The Dream of Drinking Water.
The city of Silvergawa in Ningxia once had a name for "an embarrassment": the only city along the Yellow City that was "watching the Yellow River for water".
Since 2010, the city of Silverkawa has been facing a continuous shortage of water during its peak summer period, and the "suffering from water shortage" of nearly a decade has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents, but water scarcity has become a problem for the city in the face of the fact that major water sources are at overextracted limits and that large areas of groundwater overextracted funnels have been created beneath the city.
Thanks to improvements in the quality of the Yellow River water, drinking the purified Yellow River water has become a good solution to the drinking problems of local residents.
The Deputy Director-General of the Water Authority of the City of Silverkawa, Ding Ming, presented the timely launch of the Water Supply Project for the Urban and Rural West Lines of the Silver River Metropolitan Circle in order to improve the living needs of the urban and rural residents of Silverkawa, replacing the original groundwater source with quality Yellow River water.
"On 29 December 2019, the water supply project officially reached the three districts of the city of Silverkawa, and in 2020, residents of the town of Guanning, Horan County, also drank of the Yellow River. "
Ding Ming said that the Silver River Water Department would take into account the regional adaptation of the integration of rural and urban water supply in an integrated manner, and that "the next step would be for us to fully access the West Line water supply project through the integration of rural decentralized water points, which is expected to largely achieve integrated water supply between urban and rural areas in the Silver River region by the end of this year. "
Sectors to strengthen disaster response -- the new and medium-sized network
:: Strengthened disaster response in all sectors
The news from the Ministry of Water, today (July 25), at 1200 hours, the river below the King's Dam in the Huai River was over-alarmed at 0.64-3.31 metres, the river below the middle-downstream dry-stream sand market in the Yangtze River at 0.05-2.02 metres, and the two lakes.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At 1200 hours today, Lake Taipei has an average water level of 4.67 metres and an over-secure water level of 0.02 metres.
Today, the National Defence General Council, in consultation with the Ministry of Justice, has decided to continue to maintain the Yangtze, Huai River Defence II-level response, requiring local authorities to assume responsibility for the further implementation of disaster relief efforts.
Today, the National Defence Office, the Ministry of Emergency Management, urgently deploys Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian's professional rowing vehicles to help Jiangxi address local problems such as urban flooding caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States conducted a countersubsidization survey of China with an " underestimation of the RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce, it was decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation of Zabelt (beam belt) products originating in China and an investigation on the "Underestimation of the RMB exchange rate" project.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce noted that this was the first time that the United States had investigated the so-called "RMB underestimation of exchange rates" project in a neutral countervailing case, which China strongly opposed.
In particular, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a press release on the evening of the 23rd, in which it stated that China implemented a market-based supply and demand-based regulation with reference to a basket of currencies, a managed floating exchange rate system, and that the market played a decisive role in exchange-rate formation.
The press release stressed that, in general, the RMB exchange rate was at a reasonable level of equilibrium and was not underestimated.
Since 2005, the yuan has accumulated an appreciation of over 17 per cent against the United States dollar.
According to data published by the Bank for International Settlements, between early 2005 and May 2020, the effective exchange rate of the yuan currency rose by 38 per cent and the real effective exchange rate by 49 per cent, the strongest currency in the G20 economy and one of the largest currencies in the world.
The Department of Commerce noted that the exchange rate issue went beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
In February this year, the United States amended its legislation to carry out countervailing investigations of foreign exchange rates, which are suspected of violating the WTO WTO rules and are subject to multiple oppositions.
The press release stated that even under U.S. law, there were numerous errors in the content of the applicant ' s complaint, lack of financial support, benefit award and the necessary elements of countervailing.
The Chinese side urges the United States to comply with existing international rules and to stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called "overestimation of the RMB exchange rate".
Influenced by a further rise in tensions in relations between China and the United States, it was offshore, which at one point deflated on the 22nd day of the Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Cai-Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Chong Cai-Cai-Cai-Chong Chong Chong Chong Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Cai-Bun-Bun-Bun-Bun-Bun-Bun-Bun-Bun-Bun-Bun-Bun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Chong-Chong-Chong-Chong-Chong-Cun-Chong-Chong-Chong-Cai-Chong-Chong-Cai-Cai-Cun-Cai-Chong-Cai-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Chong-Chong-Cai-Chong-Cai-Cai-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Cun-Chong-Sun-Sun-Sun-Sun
It is a matter of concern whether the United States Department of Commerce intends this move to push the RMB up.
The RMB rose to 7.0 on the 23rd day of the current exchange rate against the United States dollar, at 6.9961.
The officially regulated yuan versus the United States dollar exchange rate averaged 17 basic points down on 24 days, reported 6.9938.

. . . . . Lewis's public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There are two memorials on the first day.
On Saturday, at a public memorial at Troy University, Alabama, Lewis's five siblings and a grandson spoke of him as a man full of love, fearless and family-focused.
The youngest brother of Lewis, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting, "He's devoted his life to helping others. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . Samuel Lewis said that his mother had warned John " don't cause trouble, don't go to trouble."
He added that John did not listen to his mother ' s warning, saying, "We all know that John always gets in trouble and always gets in trouble, but that's because he's sticking to the right thing, and that's good trouble (a good trouble). "
The brothers and sisters of Lewis remind people at the memorial that John's most famous argument is to create "good trouble", that is, not to shy away from causing things as long as it's just for justice.
John had applied for the University of Troy in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but the University of Troy, which was all white at the time, refused his application for admission.
This child, John Lewis, who preached gospel to chickens on his own farm, later received a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
. . . . many years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
. . . . congressional Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters "are peacefully, non-violently protesting", as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . even if President Trump slams a boat and speaks of all the protesters as thugs, he is wrong.
The protesters were patriots who wanted the United States to move towards a more equal country. "
. A series of six-day events in honor of Lewis will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
On Saturday Lewis' coffin was stopped at a public memorial at the University of Troy, and people came to pay tribute to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.

In 1965, he and the crowd calling for black voting rights were beaten in front of the bridge by Alabama State police, who also gave tear gas to demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed.
The day after that is called "The Bloody Sunday".
The remains of Lewis will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
The mayor, Steven Reed, encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and finish this last trip with Lewis.
At the same time, officials need to wear masks and maintain social distance when they ask the public to participate in the event.
. . . . . . . . Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered half-flags to be dropped on Saturdays and Sundays in honor of Lewis.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . during the commemoration for almost a week, Lewis' remains will be divided between the Alabama State Assembly House in the city of Montgomery, the Georgia State Assembly House in Atlanta, and the United States Congress House in Washington, D.C., for a short time for the people to express their condolences.
The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, announced last week that people could come to the United States Capitol this Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Owing to the coronavirus outbreak, a public event in memory of Lewis will be held outdoors.

The costs of medical examinations falling within the basic catalogue of the health examination project are covered by the Social Health Insurance Consolidated Fund, at the standard rate of one per person per year.
It is clear that employers should rationalize their human resources, schedule their working hours, introduce a system of rotational breaks for workers with heavier mental and physical labour loads, and avoid excessive physical and mental loss or injury to their health, while strictly enforcing the system of paid leave for employees.
In addition, the employer is required to have a part-time health manager and to organize periodic staff health examinations.

The introduction or approval of implementation shall not take place without assessment or if the assessment will have a more serious adverse effect on the public health of the city or on the health of the population.

Insisting on party-building as the lead in bringing party leadership into all aspects of grass-roots governance is a fundamental requirement in the direction of grass-roots governance.
c) Raise the level of grass-roots governance by insisting on party leadership, by strengthening political leadership, building battle forts, rallying red forces, promoting party political superiority, organizing strengths and mass work strengths into governance advantages, and passing party power and claims to the "nervous end" "last kilometre".
The focus is on filling the calcium cast spirit and strengthening political leadership.
The political leadership of strengthening grass-roots governance must be carried out well in the "climate-refilling spirit" project.
The primary task is to learn from Xi Jinping's new-era Chinese socialist ideology, to "not forget the beginning, keep in mind the mission" as the eternal theme of the party's construction and the life-long subject of its members, cadres, to strengthen the principle of reading the original texts, to continue to promote the party's innovative theory by means of thematic training, training in batches, seminars, lecture halls, etc., and to encourage party cadres to further enhance "four consciousness", assertive "four confidence" and "two defence" to better perform their duties and responsibilities.

Coco Sicily hides antelopes into the backseason - Xinhua Network
A reporter from Xinhua Xin Ning (journalist Wang Jin) on 25 July was informed by the Coco Siri Administration of the Yangjiang National Park Authority that monitoring indicated that the Tibetan antelope, which had previously travelled to the Coco Siri's abdominal region of Zoroa Lake, was ending the child's birth and began to return to its original habitat with the young.
The surveillance footage near the five-lane protection stations shows that on 25 July, approximately 40 females led three Tibetan young children through the 3002 km of the Cheeky Way, the five-lane north bridge of the hidden railway, and the Tibetan antelope had begun to move back.
The expert analyses that, in recent years, the number of young antelopes in the herd has been between one quarter and one fifth of the total number of antelopes.
The Deputy Fellow of the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biological Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shin Ming, said: "In the early days of the return, the Tibetan antelopes were at higher risk of being arrested and eaten, so that the number of young children in the flock would be relatively small and could even occur without young children. "
The total number of Tibetan antelope returns is rising year by year, according to the Coco Siri Administration of the Yangjiang National Park Administration, and in 2019 the number of Tibetan antelope returns was 4860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Even Shinming said, "It is expected that this year ' s return to the antelope will end in early September, and that the number of returns to the antelopes is expected to continue to increase. "
. . Antelopes are protected animals at the national level.
Every year, at the end of May, Tibetan antelopes from the Qinghai Sanjiang, Tibet Tong, and Xinjiang Alkin Mountain travel to the Zoroa Lake, which is located in the interior of Cocoxie.
My country's antelope conservation expert, Wu Xiaomin, a researcher at the Xanxi Provincial Institute of Animals (Northwestern Institute of Endangered Animals), said, "The return of antelopes is the process of returning to their habitat with young children after the return of the female antelopes has ended the birth of their children ... The return group that initially left the birthplace is larger, but then the hideaways will return to their respective habitats along different paths, based on different geographical populations. "
In order to ensure the safe return of the herd, journalists learned that the Coco Siri Administration of the Yangjiang National Park Authority had arranged for staff to carry out continuous video monitoring and district patrols in the main areas of return.

So, how exactly do we relieve the heat in everyday life?
The experts suggest that summer trips avoid high temperature periods, preferably by not walking or working around noon in the hot sun, as the sun is strongest and the possibility of a stroke is higher.
If you have to go out at this point, you must do your protective work, such as putting on an umbrella, wearing a sunshield, wearing sunglasses, and under conditions best coating sunscreen in case of sunburning.

Based on the high and low temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, and the high-temperature operator, 3 to 5 litres per day.

In addition, the human body in the summer is prone to a shortage of potassium, which makes people tired and tired, and the potassium tea is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, more fruits with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, almonds, watermelons, melons with 80 to 90 per cent moisture, can be used to supplement moisture; dairy products can both fill water and meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high-temperature environments should be properly supplemented with drinks containing elements such as potassium, magnesium, etc.
The summer is short, the temperature is high, the body is rich in metabolism and consumption is high, and it is prone to fatigue.

I want you to spend some time thinking about a very simple fact that, so far, most of our knowledge of the universe comes from light.
We stand on Earth and look up at the night sky and see the stars in the sky with our naked eyes.
The sun is so bright,
We can see the light coming back from the moon.
Ever since Galileo aimed his simplistic astronomical telescope at celestial objects in the universe, to this day the universe we know is present in front of us through light.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we've been able to gather the loud and silent images of the universe – a series of images that can be traced back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent play, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own chorus, and the universe itself is playing constantly because space can vibrate like a drum.
So when something big happens, it can make a series of sounds to the universe.
Now, we want to be able to make a sound for this magnificent visual work of the universe.
Although we've never heard a sound from outer space, we should be able to turn the volume up over the next few years and hear what's going on there.
In response to capturing the sound of the universe, which is an ambitious goal, we focus our attention on the black hole and the prospects it shows, because the black hole is able to strike the space and time, making a very special sound like the drums hit the drums, and I'm very happy to play you some of the voices that we predict.
One day we might see a shadow and a black hole can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but it's not seen yet.
Although black holes can't be seen, they can be heard, because they hit space and time like drums.
The idea that the universe can sound like a drum comes from Albert Einstein, and actually many of our thoughts come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this picture, except for those auxiliary lines painted on it.
But if we are free to fall in the universe, even without these auxiliary lines, our tracks will draw them, because we will find us moving along straight lines, along straight lines that do not bend through the universe.
Einstein also realizes that -- this is the most crucial part of the world -- that if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe bends.
That's Einstein's great broad relativity.
Even the path of light will be curved.
When curved to a certain degree, it revolves around the orbits of the sun, like the Earth around the sun, and the Moon around the Earth.
This is the curve of nature in the universe.
But Einstein doesn't realize that if you compress the sun into a ball 6 km in diameter – that is, you compress a substance equal to a million times the Earth's mass into a ball 6 km in diameter, you will create a black hole, an object so dense that if the light is too close to it, it will not escape – leaving a huge black shadow in the universe.
But Einstein has always thought that the black hole is just a mathematical singularity.
He didn't believe there was a black hole.
He believed that nature would prevent the formation of black holes to protect us.
It took decades before people began using the term "black hole" and realized that the black hole was a real object – in fact, they were some very high-mass stars in the state of death after a catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun doesn't collapse to form a black hole.
It's not really big enough.
But if we've done some thought experiments – Einstein's very fond of doing so – we can imagine compressing the sun within six kilometers after crushing it, then putting a tiny Earth around it, for example, 30 km away from the black hole sun.
The Earth will glow itself, because now the sun is gone and we have no other source of light – so our little Earth will have to glow itself.
You'll find that you can even put the Earth in orbit 30 km away from the black hole and make it orbit happily.
This black hole is actually just about the size of Manhattan.
Before it destroys the Earth, it may swell to Hudson Street.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that's compressed to half the size of Manhattan.
So we move this Earth close to the black hole – 30 kilometers – and we note that it runs around the black hole in perfect orbit.
There are rumours that the black hole will devour everything in the universe, but actually you have to be very close before you actually fall in.
But impressively, from our point of view, we can always see the Earth.
It can't hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light coming from the Earth falls into the black hole, but some of it is seen when it bends.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the play in the space fort Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun doesn't collapse into a black hole; it's not big enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them is devouring the galaxy, it's going to look like this.
We'll see the shadow of a black hole pitching hundreds of millions of stars in the galaxy, along with star-lighted dust belts.
If we crash into this black hole, we'll see the light reflected around the black hole, and we won't even feel that some big change is happening when we start to get into this shadow.
If we try to start the rocket and get out of there, it won't work, because we can't escape, and even light can't escape.
Although the black hole looks dark from the outside, it doesn't, because the light of all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, because of the temporal expansion effect of relativity, our clocks seem to be slower than the time of the galaxy, which looks like the galaxy outside is accelerating change, just before we were destroyed by a black hole.
It's like experience of dying, you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a complete death experience.
You can't tell anyone you saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we've never seen a shadow left by such a black hole, but a black hole can be heard, even if they can't be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomy view – imagine the two black holes that have existed together for a long time.
Maybe they used to be stars and then collapsed into two black holes – each mass ten times the size of the sun.
Now we're compressing them to 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times every second.
At the end of their lives, they approach each other at the speed of light.
In the process, they not only bend space, but also create space vibrations in the tailstream behind them, a truly present temporal wave.
The black hole causes a squeezing and stretching of space when it hits the universe.
These vibrations spread in space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was done by NASA Goddard's Relativity Group.
It took almost 30 years before and after the resolution of the problem.
It's one of many groups.
It shows two black holes spinning around each other, these are imaginary curves.
As you can see – it's probably a little blurry – you can see it's being fired from red waves, and these are the gravitational waves.
They are the voices of the real universe, which will spread outward from these black holes at the speed of light as they merge with each other, until the two black holes melt together into a quietly rotating black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the squeezing and stretching of these spaces.
You really can hear these sounds.
Of course, you'll be helpless to find your head squeezed and stretched, so you may not understand exactly what's going on.
But I'd like to play for you the sound of our predictions.
This is my team's research - a relatively brief computational model.
Imagine a black hole of lesser quality falling into a black hole of higher quality.
The sound you hear comes from the collision of a small mass black hole with space in the process of approaching a large mass black hole.
If they're far away, the sound will be very small.
But gradually the sound becomes like a drumming banging space, allowing it to vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what this sound will become.
We know that in the course of falling, small mass black holes will be faster and louder.
In the end, we'll hear the little black hole fall completely into the big black hole.
I've never felt that sound so loud - it's actually amplified here.
When I was listening at home, I felt that the sound was a little bit of a distasteful.
Sounds like, ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound that our research team simulates.
I won't show you images here, because the black hole won't leave any useful trails, and the real space won't show you those virtual curves.
But if you hear this sound while you're on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run.
(laughing) Better get away from that sound.
These two black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they're all shaking hard.
Then, they'll melt together.
That sharp sound is a sign of black hole integration - it makes a sharp sound when it's over.
That's what we're about to see.
Fortunately, we're very safe at Governor Beach.
There's no doubt that two black holes somewhere in the universe have been merged together.
It's no doubt that the space around us can also feel the vibrations that traveled through a million light years, or from a million years ago, and they spread at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But these sounds are so small that we can't hear at all.
Some experiments in the world require a lot of effort to build up – one of which is an experiment called LIGO - which will detect space vibrations at a distance of four kilometres less than an atomic nucleus.
This is a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be surpassed in the coming years - it will be used to detect spatial vibrations.
Another research project on the universe is expected to start in the next 10 years, a project called LISA.
LISA will be able to see black holes of supermass - those that are millions or even billions of times the sun.
In images sent back from the Hubble Telescope, we see these two galaxies.
Looks like they're still hugging each other.
There may be a super-black hole in their center of mass.
But they're not static, they're actually integrating.
These two black holes will collide, and their integration will go through billions of years.
So gathering their voices is beyond the limits of our human perception.
But the LISA can see the final stages of two super-mass black holes that began to merge long before, that is, 15 minutes before they merged.
This detection is not limited to the black hole, but it can also be used to detect any major disturbance in the universe - the greatest of which is the "Cosmic Big Bang".
When the word was created, some mocked and said, "Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This short animated film, made by my friend at Proton Studios, shows the scene of watching the Big Bang from outside.
We would never really want to do that; we want to be inside the universe, because there's no such thing as being outside the universe.
So, imagine you're in the Big Bang.
The universe is everywhere, everything is around you, and space is swaying in disorder.
It's been 14 billion years, and this sound still surrounds us.
A galaxy gradually forms, and a group of stars form in a galaxy. On a planet, at least one such planet exists, suitable for living life.
Here, we're madly building experiments, doing calculations, writing computer codes.
Imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
This sound's been traveling through the air all along.
We didn't even show up here.
It's getting closer - 40,000 years ago, we painted on the walls of the cave.
If the sound we're going to get is from the Big Bang, it sounds like this.
Strictly speaking, it's noise.
It's a white noise, a confused bell.
But it's everywhere around us, as long as it's not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it'll be like music to our ears, because this quiet echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe we look up to.
So over the next few years, we'll be able to turn these tunes up a little bit, so that the universe will be presented to us in audio.
But if we could detect those earliest moments, it would also take us further from understanding the Big Bang, allowing us to pursue some of the most difficult, but also the most distant questions.
If we play the universe backwards, we can know that there was a big explosion in the past, and we can even hear its noisy sound, but is our big explosion the only one in the universe?
I mean, we'd have to ask, have there been any such big explosions before that?
Will it ever happen again?
I'd say that if the significance of this question were to rise to the level where TED advocates a rethinking of people, at least in this last minute, we could ask some questions that we might never be able to answer.
But we have to ask, would our universe be just an episode in a larger history?
Or are we just a branch of the multiverse – every branch of the universe has experienced its own big explosion – maybe some of them exist buzzing black holes, maybe not – some of them exist conscious lives, maybe not – they don't belong to our past or to our future, but are connected to us in some way?
So we can't help but speculate that if there is a multiverse universe, in the other branches of this multiverse, is there life?
It's life in our multiverse universe.
Is there any other life in the multiverse, and will they also speculate about our existence, thinking about their own origins?
If that's the case, I can imagine them, like us, doing calculations, writing computer codes, building experimental instruments, trying to detect the faint sounds that came from their origins, and wondering who else was there.
Thank you.

The journalists learned that this 2020 graduate art exhibition brought together 50 pieces/groups of young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the China Media University and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, and that the exhibition space was extended from two to six floors, and that full use was made of the lampbox in the building for graphic work displays, with the maximum amount of baked out of the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
The significance of this exhibition appears to be particularly special in the context of the outbreak.
"We choose to take the graduation show to the cloud to the bottom of the line again, and hope that more people will see young people exploring and understanding the world and magnifying the healing power of art for society and the mind. "
She revealed that the work in question had been collected from graduates of several major art colleges and that it had been chosen to be suitable for commercial space, and that it took the form of painting from traditional racks, sculptures, to new media devices, interactivity drawings, VR panorama, volume and richness to the greatest of all the years.
Among them, Lee Yunshaw expressed his feelings in the outbreak through mechanical and hand-mixed creative language in the first battle of 2020; Liu Jia-Ling explored the themes of "encrypted currency", "credit creation", and "transaction" through his work "Sound Money" with the Taichai block chain; Zhang Jia-chul's "catlin" and Qiu Da-chang's "trading" was often accompanied by human beings, from which young artists' understanding of the relationship between humans and animals could be seen; and Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu's work, "The winter of faith - gift" was a reminder of growing young people, "When one day's career came to fruition, don't forget that, remembering that simple and sincereness.
Among the few graduates to be personally displayed, there is Lee Hyun-chi, from the Department of Sculpture of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was actually a little worried about the outbreak and had a nucleic acid test three days earlier, which was displayed with alcohol cotton and test reports. "
The structure of his work, Yesterday as a Mystery, is more complex and must be personal.
At the same time, he also took on the task of helping his classmates repair the broken works.
"The cloth is displayed until 4:30 a.m. and then it's fixed, time is tight, it's all forgotten and taken a picture with the work, and it's a little sad."
He hoped that when the outbreak was more stable, he would come to Beijing with his classmates to see his work show.

More than 6000 pentagon sunglasses, 48 square metres per piece, one lap and one lap, like a silver "to sunflower field", turn with the sun and reflect sunlight to the centre's more than 200 metres high suction tower to achieve power generation.
The reporter saw this scene at the mid-electric project Hammy Melting Tower Photothermal Power Plant in the town of Shaggy Lake in Ighu County, Harmi City, Xinjiang.
" The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is the formation of thermal energy by reflecting solar light centrally through the mirror to the suction tower, and then converting thermal energy into electrical energy through traditional power generation technologies ... "
Zhang Yong, Deputy Managing Director, China-Electron Hammy Solar Thermal Power Company Limited, said that its design principles were similar to the solar stoves used in rural areas of north-west China, and that solar light was to be brought together.
The site was built in October 2017 and was connected by the end of last year, covering 6,600 acres, with a total of 14,500 sunglasses planned to be installed.
" The greatest advantage of conventional solar power technologies is that they can store the accumulative heat and also generate power at night... "
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project would allow the generator group to operate continuously and steadily, free from light changes; it could also participate rapidly in the grid thawing according to the needs of the grid load.
When fully completed, the project will achieve an annual capacity of 198 million degrees, save over 60,000 tons of standard coal annually, reduce more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxide, approximately 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a continuous source of clean energy for the local community.

The Hamifer light solar photovoltaic station covers more than 2300 acres, and the 714 power plants that have been built also follow the Sun and keep the sun light in 90 degrees straight angles with the spotlight.
"We use a two-axle tracking fusion power technology, and through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will maintain the efficiency of power generation by adjusting the angle to the Sun ' s altitude ... "
The station's long section, Monkiki, said that in light weather conditions, the power generation technology could increase the efficiency of photovoltaics by about 20 per cent more than traditional ones.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved more than 7 million degrees of power generation, supplementing local demand for electricity.
The Stone City Photovoltaic Industrial Garden is currently the largest single body in Xinjiang, with the fullest type of photovoltaic component, and is a demonstration of the photovoltaic industry, with a total of 38 registered photovoltaic power projects, totaling 820,000 kilowatts.
The completion of electricity generation in the first half of this year was over 110 million degrees, an increase of 6 per cent over the same period in 2019.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megafocals per square metre, with around 3,200 sunday hours throughout the year.
In recent years, the city has been developing the photovoltaic industry with a great deal of success in growing "the sunflower field".
The solar power generation scale of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built, and the city's photovoltaic capacity exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of the year, an increase of about 14 per cent over the same period.
At present, Xinjiang is connected to more than 330 PV stations, with an installed capacity of over 10 million kW.
This year, it is expected that the capacity of photovoltaics will reach 15 billion degrees per year, replacing over 6 million tons of standard coal.
The police have reported the details of the missing female college girl's trip to Qinghai, and the search and rescue work continues - Xinhua Network
On July 26, Xinhua Xinning (journalist Wang Kim Zhou Zhou) recently, the "lost link of a female college student after traveling to Qingagelmu" attracted the attention of the internet.
The Public Security Department of Germou City, Haixi Mongol Tibetan Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, reported on 26th that Huang, a student at a university in Nanjing, is still in a state of disconnection, and that several local police are working actively to find a job along Huang's part of the lost area.
On 10 July 2020, the Security Division of the Public Security Department of Germou City, Heixi State, was informed by its superiors that Huang Xiao, a Nanjing university student, had been travelling in Z164 trains from Nanjing to Germu on 5 July, and that on 9 July, he had been found in a hand-held machine and had lost contact with the south-west part of the Qing Shui River protection station in Tsomalai County, Yushi Prefecture, Qinghai Province, and requested assistance in his search.
According to an investigation by the Germou City Public Security Department, Huang entered the territory of Qinghai Province at 1954 hours on 6 July and arrived in the city of Germu at 0400 hours on 7 July.
At 0800 hours on the same day, the lost party, Huang, left for G109 State Road by the Yellow River Hotel in Gelmu City and arrived at 1200 hours at the Coca Silisonandaj Protection Station, the taxi driver returned alone, and at 1500 hours on some day, Huang arrived at the Clearwater River area near Sonandaj Protection Station until at 1800 hours on 9 September, when it closed in the area.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed through the Nai Jijiu checkpoint at 1707 hours on 13 July.
The Nacque checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by the city of Nacque in the Tibet Autonomous Region at the southern pass of the city of Germou, and, since the checkpoint has no video surveillance to ascertain information about himself and the vehicle he is travelling with, the police can only conduct a search along the way and coordinate with the public security bureau of the city of Germu if Huang is found at various checkpoints along the Tibet route.
According to the update, on 26 July, at 1 a.m., the Germou City Public Security Department organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment, travel to the Frozen Spring Protection Station along the Qingzhi road, search at Sonandaj Protection Station, and actively contact Sichuan Police, Tibet Police, Nanjing Police to work together, and search and rescue efforts continue.
The local police expect a wide range of netizens and members of society to provide timely information to the Germu police and the Nanjing Gangning police in an effort to find the missing person, Huang Chi, at an early date.
At the same time, the experts suggest that visitors should regulate, rationally, civilizedly, keep an eye on roadside warning signs, do not venture into unoccupied areas, encounter sudden events, and call the police in a timely manner.
The American press has revealed the unprovoked demand that China shut down its consulate-general in Houston - China's new network.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Online View by Zhu Yan Jing, responsible editor: Zhu Yan Jing
The American press has revealed the truth about China's unprovoked request to shut down the Consulate General in Houston.
On 24 February, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the United States Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its permit for the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and to make a specific request to the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities, as a countermeasure to the US's sudden request on 21 October to close the Consulate General in Houston.
The U.S. government's action has raised concerns and its political motivation has been questioned by outside media and scholars.
Why did China ask China to close the Consulate General?
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The U.S. Cable News Network (CNN) reported on 23 that the U.S. had asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston to raise questions about its political motivation.
The article states that the United States government's disastrous response to the New Crown outbreak resulted in President Trump's lower opinion support in the run-up to the general election.
. White House officials have privately claimed that the tough strategy taken against China was intended to save Trump's support rate, but also to shift the White House's responsibility for the failure of the outbreak.
According to the article, China's Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven, very cautious" goal chosen by the United States Government as "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of a major conflict."
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The current situation is "a spiral-up, a relative struggle", driven in part by the United States Government from domestic considerations, which only exacerbates tensions between China and the United States.
The United States Columbia Broadcasting Corporation (CBS) reported that Trump's prospects for re-election had been suppressed by the outbreak, which he had repeatedly accused China of.
There are new actions in the United States almost every day against Trump's so-called "China exploits America" absurdity.
"The Houston Consulate General is very important in establishing links between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the demand by the United States that China close its Consulate General in Houston had increased tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the south of the United States face difficulties in accessing consular services, as do United States citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret that the United States had asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to the Associated Press, this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy magazine website believes that this move by the U.S. side "is part of a series of provocative initiatives that will only worsen US-China relations."
According to Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the American think tank Brookings Institution, since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, Reuters cannot think of any move comparable to the United States action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong reported that this move by the United States was unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Chinese Consulate-General in Houston was established in 1979 as the first Chinese Consulate-General to be opened in the United States.
At present, China has an embassy and five general consulates in the United States.

In response to new changes in disease prevention and control, since 17 July, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have been actively involved in disease prevention and control efforts in response to calls from the General Trade Union of the Autonomous Region.
The Tianshan North and South trade union cadres, workers, labour models entered the streets community, the population, carried out activities such as delivery of food and medicine, sterilization, promotion of anti-sterilisation knowledge, and served the workforce, highlighting the union's "hard nuclear power" with practical action.
In recent days, Urumqi City Tianshan General Trade Union mourns a group that delivers a much-needed set of outbreak-proof and controlled living goods to staff at 12 quarantine points.
In the wake of the outbreak, Tianshan spent more than 1.05 million dollars in the first time in total, and was allocated to 23 immediate grass-roots trade unions on an emergency basis.
The Deputy Secretary of the Chinese Xianjiang Construction Worker's First Construction Party, the union president Zhao Zhongxian, after receiving the company's notification of the outbreak prevention and control, offered to stay on duty and protect the workers.
He sends cooks, foods and daily supplies to workers living in unit dormitories and new entrants, and organises personnel to deliver them every two days with essentials for their lives.
"As of 21 July, staff members of the cadres who held the line of the battle 'Epidemic' were sampled and replaced with anti-preventable supplies and living materials by a line-up and a merchant's delivery at home, first acting as a crowd of 704 first-line workers in the Urumuzi area. "
The head of the Xinjiang Transport Union told reporters that, in the face of the outbreak, they were fully committed to the protection of disease prevention and control services, steadily advancing transport development efforts and creating a strong atmosphere of solidarity in the fight against the epidemic.
In the current heat of the summer, trade unions at all levels keep a close eye on line workers in priority areas for the prevention and control of the outbreak, putting "singing cool" care and care to the ground.
On 19 July, the Urumuzi County General Trade Union launched a "Cleaning" condolence campaign to an outbreak-control line of workers, and the county-wide police station, card points and health system received condolences such as beverages, fruits, etc.
"The trade union cadres need to further advance political positions, strengthen their responsibilities, take care of the warmth of the people, and encourage the struggle with action.
To fully realize the role of trade union organizations in bringing together workers, uniting workers, providing protection for disease prevention and control services, actively defending the health rights and interests of workers at large, and bringing care to the first line of workers. "
The relevant head of the Autonomous Region General Trade Union said.

Spokesman for the Embassy in the United Kingdom: Chinese Government is a staunch defender of cyber security — China's new network
According to the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom website, on July 26, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom responded to a journalist's question about the wrong speech about the cyber attack.
The speaker stressed that the Chinese Government was a staunch defender of cyber security and had always been firmly opposed and opposed to any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
Questions from journalists: According to the media, hacker organizations associated with China had interfered with the network system of a British company, launched an attack on British-American technology companies with proprietary data, and invaded the network of national governments of the European Union.
The speaker stated that the Chinese Government, as a staunch defender of cybersecurity, has always been firmly opposed and opposed to any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
The virtual nature of cyberspace, the retrospective difficulties, the diversity of actors should provide sufficient evidence when investigating and characterization network events, and should not be unwarrantedly speculated.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It is in the common interest of all States to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
The speaker noted that China's achievements in science, technology and innovation were not stolen, not robbed, but fought hard through self-reliance.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) channel, with an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a great power of innovation and intellectual property.
The Chinese People's Bank Urumqi Central Branch data show that in the first half of the year, new loans from Xinjiang-related farmers and micro-enterprises exceeded the year-round increase of 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Centre branch of the People's Bank used a variety of monetary policy instruments to guide the banking sector to increase lending and provide adequate financial security for outbreak control and rehabilitation.
Urumqi free nucleic acid testing in most districts has been largely completed, with secondary testing in high-risk areas - the new and medium-sized network
Zhang Wei, Director of the Urumqi City Health Board of Urumqi on July 26, China's new network Urumqi (journalist Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin), said in a briefing on the latest outbreak and detection of nucleic acids in Urumqi city, that at present most of the Urumqi city's free nucleic acid detection work has been largely completed.
The development of the epidemic is being further assessed by the Department of State expert group and the Autonomous Region, experts from the city of Urumuzi, based on the results of the nucleic acid detection and epidemiological survey.
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Press Office held a press conference on 26 February to inform the Xinjiang outbreak and control.
According to him, between 000 and 2400 hours on 25 July, 22 new cases of corona pneumonia were confirmed in the city of Urumuzi (of which 5 were referred to patients with asymptomatic infections) and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infections.
As of 2400 hours on 25 July, there were 135 confirmed cases in the city of Urumuzi and 147 cases of asymptomatic infections.
The 25-day addition of asymptomatic infections was also largely proactively screened through free nucleic acid testing throughout the city.
Zhang Wei, Director of the Urumuzi City Health Board, stated on 26 February that most of the Urumuzi city-wide free nucleic acid testing had been largely completed.
He also said that, from the experience of other parts of the country, there were a number of factors affecting the results of nucleic acid detection, such as detection of reagent sensitivity, time of infection and detoxification of the person being tested, co-operation of the person being tested at the time the specimen was taken (a poor degree of co-operation might have resulted in the specimen not being taken in place) and detection of the environment, and operational proficiency of the test personnel.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . for various
The so-called pseudonegative means that the person being tested is indeed an infected person, but the results of the nucleic acid tests are negative.
Also, for those who are in close contact with confirmed cases, a suspected case usually requires two nucleic acid tests to be ruled out.
For those who have been to high-risk areas of the outbreak, if there are symptoms of fever and respiratory tracts, a nucleic acid detection negative may have a pseudonegative potential, so two nucleic acid tests are also required to be excluded.
In view of the above, he said that, in the interest of the physical well-being of the population of the city as a whole, the city of Urumuzi would conduct a second free nucleic acid test in priority areas such as Tianshan, Shaybak District, and "recovering leaks" as of today.

Quite diverse anti-septic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between the regions, although the epidemic varies from place to place and requires tailored responses.
The outbreak in one area will eventually affect the rest of the region.
"Now is not the time for complacency," said Fouch, "Our work is not complete, we must intensify our efforts, and we must also be vigilant about the uncertainty of the future."
A Chinese-American medical expert, the founder of the treatment of AIDS cocktail therapy, Ho freshman, noted at the conference that the new coronae outbreak in the United States had not reached its peak.
"Every one of us must do our part to slow down the spread of the virus. "

Since this year, relations between China and the United States have rapidly deteriorated, with disputes between the two sides covering a range of issues such as the origin of the new coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
The President of the United States, Trump, while boasting at the beginning of the year about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, has recently changed his attitude.
. . . . . . . . . . . at the White House press conference, he said that although China had recently purchased a record amount of American corn on a single day and had also bought a lot of soybeans, "the trade deal now means to me less to me than it did when it was made."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also argued that a new round of trade negotiations was unlikely to take place due to poor US-China relations, and that "trade issues have lost weight in US-China relations."
But he revealed that China's trade-related units had still met on the 23rd day to discuss a range of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We've tried to buy them, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
The Vice-President of the National Council for American-China Trade, Peng Jening, said that maintaining the momentum of the first phase of the agreement was "more important than ever" and referred to China's progress this year in further opening financial markets to U.S. businesses.
"It's better to talk than not to talk, though it may only be considered routine." said Plenum analyst, an independent research company.

Is this the best time for Chinese businesses to go to the US market in the wake of the outbreak and the Sino-China crisis?
" As far as the recent IPO case and the company that is going to go to the US market are concerned, the IPO is essentially unaffected, and the market is now very good, even at this point, the best time point for a Chinese company to go to the US IPO in the last 10 years. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . at the 2020 Listed Corporate Leaders Summit, hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the United States Securities Commission (SEC) and the United States Public Corporate Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued a "Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information – A Discussion on the Challenges of Current Access to Information by United States Listed Companies with a large number of operations in China".
The statement states that, despite the significant increase in international cooperation and coordination in recent years, problems with access to information still exist in the United States regulatory authorities, and that the SEC and the PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; in contrast to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies and their auditing agencies that have experienced audit obstacles, with a large number of companies in general.
In addition, in May this year, the Senate of the United States Congress passed the Foreign Corporate Accountability Act, which introduced additional disclosure requirements for foreign companies on the United States market.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . does not affect the appetite of investors.
. . . . . . . . . when this news came out, everyone was asking if it was possible to go to the United States in the future, but later we found that these issues were not a matter for investors, who might ask them, or even become a matter of standardization, on their recent journey to the United States IPO, but that was not taken by investors as an important factor in not investing in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that you look at the current situation as ordinary as possible.
This surface, of course, may seem to be the worst in the past two years, but has not been affected in terms of investors' appetite.
So from now on to the end of this year or before the U.S. general election, the rush to the US IPO will continue. "
On May 9, this year, Kim Shanyun was officially listed in NASDAQ, United States, as the first Chinese enterprise to go to the US IPO in the aftermath of the outbreak.
"Gin Shanyun's listing gives the Chinese company behind the preparation of IPO very much confidence. "
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
(c) In terms of total initial fund-raising, 20 enterprises raised a total of $2.725 billion, an increase of more than 52.4 per cent over the same period last year;
The Chinese company that went to the US IPO in the first half of this year is of higher quality and has a hard foundation and growth quality company that will be more favoured by investors, according to Xing.
In the short, medium and long term, Xing-seong continued to be optimistic about Ming China's visit to the United States IPO.
"The short-term is that the rush to the US IPO continues; the medium-term is that Chinese companies have more options, A shares, Harbour shares, US shares, and all will use US general elections and US-China relations as a consideration for market choices and time choices; in the long term, everything will return to normality, with market volatility being a cycle, both political and economic, which will eventually return to normal stages, and the stock market has traditionally been ahead of volatility. "
At the same time, he said, "There are a lot of uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that can be seen by investors, other factors are relatively minor, and investors need to invest in good Chinese companies."

People ' s Daily Reviewer: Focus on doing your own business and building new advantages for future development – learning to follow up on the important speech of Xi Jinping General Secretary at the Entrepreneurs ' Symposium – Xinhua Network
Xinhua Beijing, July 25, People's Daily, July 26, commentator's article: Focusing on doing your own business, building new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still extremely complex, and the challenges to our development are unprecedented.
Stay strategic, increase confidence in winning and concentrate on doing our own business is the key to our dealing with the various risk challenges.
At the recent Entrepreneurial Symposium, General Secretary Xi stressed that in the current external environment of increased protectionism, a world economic downturn and a shrinking global market, we must concentrate on doing our part, fully exploiting domestic super-large market advantages, gradually developing a new development landscape dominated by a large domestic cycle, mutually reinforcing domestic and international double-cycles, upgrading the supply chain of industrial chains, vigorously promoting scientific and technological innovation, accelerating critical core technological challenges and building new advantages for future development.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the external context of the deepening development of economic globalization, markets and resources "outside" play an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the outbreak is undergoing profound change, facing additional uncertainties and uncertainties, and economic globalization is being met with reverse winds and backslides.
A crucial aspect of preparing for a longer period of thought and work to cope with the changes in the external environment, driving our economy to a windfall and to a great deal of stability, is to use the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as a strategic basis for development, to make the best use of its advantages, to give impetus to our economic development through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the opening up of the domestic cycle, and to boost the world economy's recovery.
We need to be deeply aware that building a complete system of domestic demand is related to our long-term development and long-term peace.
The party's central review of the situation, which clearly sets out a firm strategy for expanding domestic demand, is needed to deal with the impact of the outbreak, to sustain the long-term and healthy development of our economy and to meet the needs of the people's growing good life.
The advantage of large economies is internal recyclability.
We have the most complete and large industrial system in the world, strong productive capacity, well-developed matching capacity, over 100 million market subjects and more than 170 million highly educated or skilled people, as well as an over-large domestic demand market of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, which is in the midst of new forms of industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and rapid development of agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
. Public ownership as a subject, the co-development of a diverse ownership economy, the distribution of labour as a subject, the coexistence of a variety of modes of distribution, and the socialist basic economic system such as the socialist market economy system, can both stimulate the dynamism of various market subjects, liberate and develop social productivity, and promote efficiency and equitable organic unity and the constant achievement of common wealth.
We need to be firm in expanding this strategic base of domestic demand, allowing production, distribution and circulation to rely more on domestic markets for a virtuous cycle, defining the strategic direction of supply-side structural reforms, and promoting a dynamic balance between total supply and total demand at a higher level.
In order to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, to vigorously advance innovation in science and technology and other aspects of innovation, to accelerate the advancement of strategic and emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life health, and new materials, to create more new growth points, growth poles, and to evolve a new development paradigm dominated by large domestic cycles and mutually reinforcing domestic and international bicycles.
Openness leads to progress, and closure is bound to lag behind.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Quite dominated by large domestic cycles, it is by not closing doors for closed operations, but by harnessing the potential of domestic demand to make domestic and international markets better connected, making better use of both international and domestic markets, and both resources, to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and expanding openness, and the smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to creating a new pattern of openness and the more conducive it is to creating new advantages of participation in international cooperation and competition.
While international protectionist thinking is on the rise, we are on the right side of history to insist on deepening reforms, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the building of an open world economy, and contributing to the building of a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has experienced many ordeals in its history, but has never been crushed, but has become more frustrated, growing up in it and rising from it.
On the way forward, with strong leadership from the party centre, with Comrade Xi at the heart of the party, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system that characterizes China, strong mobilization capacity and strong combined strength, the unity struggle of the entire national army, we must be able to overcome all the difficult obstacles, maintain the momentum of good economic and social development in our country, fully build a small and prosperous society and successfully embark on a new journey towards the full construction of a modern socialist State!
The balance gains went down "90" instead of "retributive" savings?
As the balance gains went down, not only did the "90s" not escape the balance, but instead began to "retribute" money?
The "Saving up after balance 90 report" published by the Chinese Institute of New Economic Studies in conjunction with the day before the payment of the money (2020 edition) showed that in the first half of the year, "90 years later" was more interested in saving money: the amount of money saved per capita was nearly 40 per cent higher than in 2019.
Interestingly, after 90, it's more likely to start with a pen of "small money", with 60% of the average amount being below $20...
Use the balance to save money, and become a "90-year-old" habit of saving money.
The data show that of the 700 million surplus treasure users, 134 million are "after 90"
There are 174 million "after 90" in China, which means that about three out of every four "after 90" in the country are saving their money with the balance.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of monetary funds, such as balance sheets, has fallen from above 2 per cent at the beginning of the year to around 1.5 per cent.
Even so, it doesn't affect the pace of "after 90" savings.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The payment treasure data show that, as of July 13, the new "kimin" on the payment treasure had more than doubled in the same year, and that more and more young people had achieved "progress" finance on payment treasures.
According to analysts, the flow of funds from surplus treasures into the stock market was also an important reason for the clear decline in IMF shares in June.
The report also shows that "after 90" girls are more inclined to raise more money, on average 20% more than boys; of the users who hold funds on the payment platform, 60% are men and women tend to choose a more robust way of managing money than men.
What's the plan after 90?
The payment data show that "after 90" there is a habit of targeting money, with travel being the most frequent user of money-saving targets.

On July 26, China's famous centre for vascular surgery — Shanghai Long Sea Hospital, Naval Medical University — signed with Xiamen University-affiliated Chinese Mountain Hospital for vascular surgery on July 26, China (Yan Volyama Zhang Shuxian Zhu Jing — Xu Jianxian) to establish a collaborative centre to promote communication between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially in the field of aortic acute disease.
Auxiliary Nakayama Hospital stated that, after the formal establishment of a collaborative unit for the vascular surgery of the two hospitals, remote consultations would be conducted, treatment programmes would be developed on real-time with the Changhai Hospital, skills development would be selected, a joint weekly surgical technical exchange would be conducted, a teaching inspection would be carried out, etc.; in complex cases, longhai specialists could be invited to the hospital for surgery, depending on the patient ' s needs, so that the best medical resources available to patients in the country could be made available to patients in the southwest without provincialisation.
The two hospitals will also work together on surgical innovation research, acoustic disease science and early screening, among others.
The Aortic Seminar, hosted by the Beijing Health Promotion Society, was held in Xiamen on the same day, hosted by Nakayama Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University.
The above-mentioned two well-known hospitals held a signing ceremony at the same time of the meeting for a collaboration centre for blood-surgery and announced the formation of a collaborative unit to work together to raise the level of treatment for blood-surgery-related diseases in the south-western region of Guan.
The Shanghai Long Sea Hospital vascular surgery is the only vascular surgical institute in the army and the only clinical medical centre for diseases of the vascular system in Shanghai City, as well as the first national priority subject of vascular surgery, leading the establishment of the Chinese Medical Association's Professional Committee on Intra-vascular Sciences, which is the top team in the industry that has accumulated a great deal of interest.
Professor Wong Xiaojin, Director of vascular surgery at Nakayama Hospital, Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
Zhongshan Hospital vascular surgery, the first independent discipline in Fujian province, has long been dedicated to the treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases, and was approved for the construction of a provincial clinical focus in 2018.
In the treatment of aortic disease, there is a wealth of experience in emergency ruptured aneurysms, in addition to treatment of interlayeral aneurysms and aortic aneurysms.
" The history of the development, breadth, difficulty and complexity of the vascular surgery at Nakayama Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, is remarkable in the region, so we set up this time a collaborative centre that, in addition to the aortics, can provide a full range of medical, pedagogical and scientific cooperation in the treatment of diseases such as the lower artery, the neck artery, etc. "
Professor Feng Hui, Deputy Director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Long Sea Hospital, said.
The University of Xiamen affiliated Nakayama Hospital and the Shanghai Changhai Hospital had signed a contract in 2018 for the establishment of a digestive infirmary "Lee Moshin's medical studio".
In an interview with the Chinese New Network reporter, Professor Wong Xiaojin, the hospital's chief of vascular surgery, said that the hospital's vascular surgery had also been formally formed as a collaboration between the two hospitals for a long time, allowing them to work together to communicate again on the new steps.
He said that Shanghai experts would be invited regularly to conduct surgical technology exchanges, teaching rooms, discussion of suspected cases, etc., while further remote consultations were being conducted, currently planned for once a week; in addition, the section would select personnel for further training and exchange to enhance the development and development of a cadre of personnel in the disciplines.
At the meeting, journalists learned that vascular disease was the first cause of death in China and that the aortic arteries, as the main cause of the various organs of the human body, flowed from the heart to the whole body, bearing an important role.
The occurrence of acoustic disease is often accompanied by high risks, high mortality rates and the difficulty of treatment, with the roughest section of the aortics up to 4 cm in diameter, which, once an angioplasm is formed, a breakup occurs, or an endomebra break produces a clamp layer, which causes a large bleeding and is very dangerous.
In recent years, with changes in people's way of life, the pace of life has accelerated and China has become the world's first country in high blood pressure, with an increase in the number of aortic diseases, and today, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases has continued to grow in a minimal, rapid and efficient direction.

This academic seminar invited more than a dozen national experts to the field to discuss new developments in the treatment of aortic diseases, to conduct cutting-edge technical training and to discuss difficult cases in the form of conference salons.
At the meeting, journalists learned that, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is now developing in a modest, rapid and efficient direction.

Among them, the Zhengzhou to Yangyang section was opened early on 1 December 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The 26-day-long, small three canyon tunnel is a full-line control project for Zheng Wangao Iron, which is located on the border with Wuqing County in Chongqing City, approximately 18.9 km long and 890 m deep at its maximum.
The tunnel began construction in February 2017 and was fully connected on 26 July 2020.
According to the Royal Army, the head of the design of the Chinese Iron II Engineering Group, Zheng Wangau Iron Tunnel, a survey designer, the geologic conditions of the location of the small Three Canyon Tunnels are very complex, facing risks such as rock solubility, mudslides and large deformations of soft rock, which are classified as high-risk tunnels of class I, and which are extremely difficult to design and construct.
"In the course of the construction of the project, we have adopted a special design program for more than 30 types of soluble holes, using such methods as geological surveying, discovery and supra-preliminary drilling, such as the design of a 24-metre-long bridge that spans the tunnel's longitudinal length of more than 10 metres and depths of more than 55 metres to avoid tunnel deposition. " The Royal Army said.
The construction of the tunnel, as described by the Iron Tunnel Department in the construction section, was carried out in a manner of diversion and congestion, through the construction of cross-hole smoothing, sloughing, enhanced tunnel structure support and the construction of sewage treatment stations, which both ensured orderly advance of the project and avoided damage to the water bodies of the small three canyon landscapes, while successfully overcoming construction difficulties such as the 7-kilometre-long soft rock large deformation, with a maximum daily influx of 157,000 cubic metres of more than mud.
The construction of the entire Zheng Wangau railway line will become a new convenient and fast passenger main route to China, North China and North-East, in the south-west of the country. It will be important to improve the capacity and quality of the north-east rail route to the south-west, improve the layout of the regional road network, accelerate the process of tourism resource development and urbanization along the route, promote coordinated regional development and promote the implementation of the major western development strategy.
Experts say it's unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the U.S. Census for the allocation of seats in the House.
Some civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties sued the U.S. federal government, saying that it was not feasible and unconstitutional for the Trump Presidential Office to attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census.
The United States Census will determine the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
American Civil Liberties Union executive lawyer Sara Brannon said to Voice of America, "It's not going to work. "
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of the person surveyed in the census was difficult to achieve and was "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties organization, the common cause organization, filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.

The United States Supreme Court prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship in the 2020 census table last year.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing the regulation of U.S. Census Department business minister Ross' data on the unlicensed population that he submitted to the census so that the administration could exclude these unlicensed populations from the census figures of the states and thus determine whether each state has increased or reduced or maintained the seat of the House of Representatives.

Heavy rains in 33 districts of Chongqing Local emergency response for the Zhongqing IV class - China New Network
A reporter for Xinqing's July 26 (journalist Ko Gaoyang, Li Song) has learned from Chongqing City's Command for Drought Prevention that Chongqing City has seen a new round of heavy rainfall weather processes starting on July 25, heavy rainfall in 33 districts, and over-alarm water level flooding in four small and medium rivers, and that a local emergency response to the Zhongqing Class IV has been launched.
According to Chongqing City Hydrological Monitoring Terminal, between 0800 and 0800 hours on 25 and 26 June, heavy rains occurred in 33 districts, including Wanzhou, Yunyang and Namchuan.
The largest solar rainfall occurs in Longsan Village, Kinsan Township, Namchuan, at 197.5 mm.
The water levels are still rising.
The heavy rains also led to landslides in the village of Six Wells, a land village in the Wulong district, resulting in the disruption of road traffic in the village, the slides into the Ujiang tributary along the river, blocking the course to form Lake Lüsse, and the local emergency organization of a downstream mass transfer.
In response to the heavy rains, the Chongqing City Command for Drought Prevention released early warning information on River Flood III at 1300 hours and launched an emergency response to the Zhao IV level, requiring the districts and units concerned to strengthen their patrols, mobilize emergency relief teams and supplies in a timely manner, and evacuate people in the threatened areas.
In response, the construction of industrial projects-view headlines-Hunan Daily News Network-China Voice Online
The summer's Hunan, the heat wave is poking.
The province-wide industry project, which builds a live viewing passion, has covered the heat of three volts of heat, "with industry over strength, with project heroism" encouraging the thievery four.
The development of Hunan always depends on the construction of projects and the development of industries.
In the face of a very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the party center, with Comrade Xi at the centre, the entire province insisted on a game of chess, with all its efforts to fight the disease, fight two hard battles, and use industrial projects as a "first hand" for the implementation of "Six Stable" six-prosecutions.
The decline in GDP from 1.9 per cent per year in the first quarter to 1.3 per cent in the first half of the year, the difficulty of the period, the great effort, is self-evident.
On this valuable report card, industrial project construction is the key support for Hunan's acceleration of economic recovery and the development of stability for good.
It's smooth, it's irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects, to be put in the big picture, is both powerful, aggressive, aggressive, and knowledgeable, change-oriented and responsive.
Against the backdrop of the current complex and difficult international situation, it is necessary to take a quiet look at the new features of the current new situation, to be more disciplined, to be more scientificly accurate, and to be better integrated into the new development patterns that are based on a large domestic cycle, with domestic and international bicycles mutually reinforcing.
Increased focus on upgrading the industrial base.
In the first half of the year, I saved not only a large number of new and emerging industry heavyweight investment projects to open up, sowing hope, but also more traditional niche industries to accelerate the plaque point in the digital, intelligent, greening industrial transformation, falling off like a fly.
The Liyang Oscon 3rd Science Park project is retrofitting existing production lines, with high-end printing circuit board smart production lines taking the lead; Hunan's new factory area is dedicated to the intellectual transformation and construction of modern plants, as well as a vivid picture of the "new budding of old trees" ... with a strong focus on strengthening niche industries, actively developing new industries, increasing technological innovation and national production alternatives in order to continuously build the basic conditions and build transformational energy.
Increased focus on the development of a new business model for the development of a new economy.
The sudden new coronae outbreak, which brought the "cloud economy" red-hot, inspired the potential of the digital economy to provide new opportunities for industrial change: in the first half of the year, I saved the computer and office equipment manufacturing industries, the electronic and communications equipment manufacturing industries by 12.6 per cent, the online retail sales of retail businesses above the limit increased by 32.2 per cent over the same time, and the online meal revenue of catering enterprises by 35.6 per cent over the same time.
The new machines in the crisis, the opening of a new era in change, the active promotion of digital industrialization, the digitalization of industry, the guiding of the digital economy and the integrated development of the real economy are the main trends.
Increased focus on optimizing and stabilizing the supply chain of the industrial chain.
The engineering machinery is the main force in the Hunan industry, but two thirds of the associated businesses are out of the province and there is room and potential in the accompanying chain.
The Project for Strengthening Industrial Chain Thinking requires not only the sustained accumulation of head-to-head businesses to achieve technological breakthroughs at key links in the industrial chain; it also needs to be cultivated locally to stimulate the "chain" lock reaction with strong chain-to-chain extensions, to promote the synergistic layout of the relevant supporting industries and to accelerate the building of autonomous, controlled and secure supply chains of industrial chains.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There are frequent calls, new moves, and real moves across the province to think that the "reducing" of high-quality development by enterprises is an "acceleration" of the "reduced" of high-quality development; Shaoyang's "shaulent" service, which does nothing to do with the business and does nothing to pay for the policy, can't solve the problem at night ... In recovering the damage caused by the outbreak, there are "many ways" to find a quasi-short-plate pain point and achieve the rare living stories that are at stake.
Quite a mind to study the industry, to nurture it, to develop it, to firmly optimize the business environment, will win the favor of more investors.
The front winds are still in place, but the state of windbreak has become the norm for building industry projects across the province to advance high-quality development.
In this critical period, it is important to learn well, to follow the spirit of important instructions from Xi Jinping's General Secretary series, to respond effectively to external uncertainties with certainty of his work, and to continue to advance industrial project construction with enthusiasm, sweating together to ensure the successful completion of the "13th Five" and full-scale construction of a small Kan society.

The overall flatness of employment and prices suggests that the economy has a "temperature" - a new net.

The general level of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature"
Journalist of the Economic Journal China Economic Network
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new corona pneumonia epidemic, the country has integrated efforts to prevent and control the epidemic and to promote economic and social development. The situation of disease prevention and control has continued to improve, the economy has recovered steadily, and employment and price performance, which are closely related to the livelihood of the people, have generally stabilized, and the Chinese economy has handed over a thermostat of economic performance.
In the first two months of the year, the survey unemployment rate rose.
In February, in particular, many business activities were largely out of business, the demand for workers in enterprises was reduced, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the unemployment rate in town surveys rose.
As the situation with regard to the prevention and control of the outbreak gradually improves, the social order of life in production continues to recover.
The party's center has maintained the overall tone of steady and well-advanced work, further increased macro-policy leverage, strengthened employment priorities across the board, and actively promoted job-stable support.
We have stepped up our policies to stabilize jobs, put in place a combination of "recession and respite" policies, a phased reduction of the contribution component of three social insurance units, allowing the extension of social insurance premiums, expanding the return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized micro- and micro-enterprises, benefiting from the employment-training policy, receiving subsidies for enterprises to absorb the employment of priority groups, traineeship subsidies, etc.
As the implementation of stable employment policies has fallen, the demand for employment in enterprises has steadily recovered, the employment situation has gradually improved, the unemployment rate in town surveys has declined, and in June the unemployment rate in surveys was 5.7 per cent.
Zhang Yi, Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of the National Statistics Office, said that employment policies continued to work during the second quarter, with the return of the labour force from the previous period due to the effects of the epidemic, and the urban labour participation rate rose by about 10 percentage points in June compared to February, close to the same level in the same period last year.
The data show that total urban employment increased by more than 19 per cent in June than in February, with most industries reaching pre-epidemic levels; the average weekly working hours for employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours from February and a slight increase of 0.1 hours from January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
This January, the CPI increased by 5.4 per cent the same year, creating a new high for many years.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The CPI increase is high at the same time, with pre-spring consumption demand pull factors as well as spring fault months and lower than the same base.
However, the impact of the new corona pneumonia outbreak on prices is particularly evident.
As a result of the outbreak control, logistical delays, delays in supplies and increased costs of transportation of goods occurred throughout the country in January and February, as well as the hoarding and purchase of goods by some citizens, resulting in a marked rise in prices for some of the essentials of life.
In response to the disturbance of the price situation caused by the outbreak control, the authorities included vital goods in the emergency transport guarantee to ensure the smooth transport of the goods.
The market supply of vegetable melons is strongly guaranteed by a series of policy initiatives.
In response to the rapid increase in pork prices at the beginning of this year, the central policy of securing price stability was quickly implemented in the various regions, with a marked improvement in the supply of pork reserves, an orderly restoration of raw pig production capacity and a gradual normality in production and marketing.
Since March, pork prices have been declining continuously, driving food prices back to 10.6 per cent in May, and in June, pork prices have risen slightly over the cycle, influenced by factors such as a slowdown in the production of pigs, a decline in imports and a rebound in group consumption demand.
The seasonal variations in the prices of fresh vegetables are evident, with an average increase of 3.4 per cent in the first half of the year.
. As a result of the higher comparison base in the same period last year, prices for fresh fruit continued to decline in comparison with the previous year, averaging 13.3 per cent in the first half of the year.
The basic life of the masses is effectively guaranteed, and the economic and social situation remains stable and orderly.
The market supply and demand improved as transport logistics gradually recovered, increased coverage everywhere.

Heilongjiang carried out a special clean-up operation under the name of a well-known hospital - China New Network
In recent years, the names of some medical institutions have been irregular and inappropriate, and the unauthorized use of the names of well-known medical institutions without authorization from the law has led to the misleading treatment of the population.

The play's reading was entirely composed of the background of the Beijing Humanist Young Actor, and was rehearsed for two weeks under the director Don Zhong, and each created a small profile to in-depth profiling of the characters, with a view to being able to re-examine, after nearly 40 years, the light of this realist drama as a rejuvenating charm.

As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work of art, I try to make it clear that human beings are not separated from nature, but that everything is connected to one another.
I went to Antarctica for the first time about 10 years ago, and I saw icebergs for the first time.
I feel awe.
My heart is banging fast, dazzling, trying to understand what's going on in front of me.
I can only feel strange that a snowflake is covered in another snowflake, formed year after year.
The formation of icebergs is when they break from glaciers or from ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their surrounding environment and their circumstances.
Some of the icebergs refuse to compromise and stick to the end, while others can't bear to collapse and burst under a sudden burst of passion.
When you see icebergs, it's easy to think that they're all isolated, they're independent, they're separate, they're more like what we humans sometimes think of ourselves.
But the reality is far more than that.
As the iceberg melted, I breathed to its old smell.
As the iceberg melts, it releases fresh water rich in minerals that nourishes everything.
I started shooting these icebergs as if I was making portraits of my ancestors, and I realized that at these individual moments, icebergs existed in that way, but never again.
When they melt, it's not death; it's not an end, it's a continuation of the way to life.
I've filmed icebergs, some of which are very young -- thousands of years old.
Some ice, over 100,000 years.
The last picture I want to show you is an iceberg I shot on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
It's a very rare opportunity for everyone to actually witness an iceberg roll.
So that's what the figure shows.
You can see a boat on the left.
It's a boat about 15 feet.
I want you to notice the shape of the iceberg, the shape of it on the surface of the water.
Here you see it starting to roll, the boat moving to the other side, and a man standing there.
It's an average size Greenland iceberg.
It surfaces about 120 feet high or 40 metres high.
This video was shot in real time.
Like this iceberg, they show you different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.

Qinghai Province, Zhang Jian-hoon, Deputy Director of the Department of Industry and Information, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Region, said.
On the same day, the live delivery of the "Community Battle Slurry Helping Farmers" bee products was held on the shores of Qinghai Lake, and various parties such as the Chinese Bee Products Association and business representatives, and the Hinnon, joined forces to promote the Qinghai feature bee products, selling nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau bees under the line totalling nearly $3.8 million.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It is known that this live delivery event, which builds on the Beijing Heidelbergs chain network, fast-handers, and domestic-renowned bee retail businesses such as poachers, live broadcasts, electrician platforms, has led to "business + bee farmers + growers" exchange cooperation and continued distribution of "green sea highland spasm consumption coupons" to consumers via online, offline channels, with the company expected to make a total of nearly $5.28 million a year.
In response, Chena, President of the Heidelberg Bee Industry, Inc., Beijing, argued that "it's worth it": "It's a move that can increase the visibility of the Qinghai bee products, attracts more consumers to understand, prefers to add pure natural bee products, and drives the bee farmers to gain. "
At present, the company has entered into a production cooperation strategic agreement with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Ltd., Qinghai Bees Shares Corporation, with a view to jointly promoting the growth of the local bee industry in Qinghai.

"The bees are ‘environmental scouts' and the heavily polluted area bees cannot survive." "The Chang Xiaochuan, Standing Vice-President of the Chinese Bee Products Association, introduced that bees pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and has an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination increases the quality of crops, especially in areas with widespread and poorly managed conditions, where pollination is of greater significance.
Research data show that pollination can increase the production of oil cuisine by 15 - 30 per cent.
The figure presents the products of the Qinghai bee for Chang Xiaochuan (right), Permanent Vice-President of the Chinese Bee Products Association.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of the bee product itself, and the bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological conservation, which has been poorly known ... "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Today, however, the number of beekeepers is decreasing, and in addition to the year-rounded humming farmers, there are still many poor households that are not well-equipped to act, who choose to enter stock cooperatives with beehive boxes.
" The State has financial support, we have contacts with technicians to help guide, the lack of understanding and judgment of the market environment by the hindstores, and the help and coordination of governments, businesses, and industry associations in order to open up the market. "
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"It is hoped that you will pay more attention in the future to help raise the bee group," said Tina, "our bee products are also strictly screened and regulated in accordance with national standards, ensuring quality and protecting consumer rights while helping the bee farmers. "

In his address, Minister Counsellor Zheng Chong Chong said that this was an opportunity for both Vietnamese and Laos to remember the revolution in the two countries together and to express their gratitude for the great sacrifices they made for their independence, as well as a good opportunity for the two peoples to recall the two countries' joint efforts to combat the common enemy, fight for national independence, national unity, build national development and consolidate relations between the two countries.
74 years ago, on 23 January 1946, 28 fighters of the Old Vietnam Combat League died heroically while attacking the Phonehe stronghold.
The victory of this attack became a historic victory for both countries in the early stages of the revolutionary struggle for national liberation.
Ms. Zheng Chong stressed that the peoples of the two countries will always remember the great sacrifices made to the cause of the struggle for national liberation, while stressing that the young part of the two countries will continue to build on the heroic and strong traditions of their predecessors and make their due contribution to the results of the continued flowering of old relations and the prosperous development of the two countries.

The statement stated that the drone had fallen inside Lebanese territory while the army was carrying out its mission near the Blue Line on the Israeli-Lebanese border.
The statement does not mention the reason for the drone crash.
There are Israeli media reports that the drone may have crashed as a result of a malfunction.
The Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Ganz reportedly said during his visit to northern Israel that afternoon that Israel would continue to act against Syria and Lebanon in order to ensure its security interests.
Israel has long seen Hezbollah in Lebanon as a major security threat, and has accused the Iranian side of delivering weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon through the Syrian land corridor, which is tense near the Israeli-Lebanese border.
On a number of occasions, Israel carried out air strikes against targets in Syria on the grounds of attacking the organization.

Greenfield opens a new round of remodeling, Shanghai is planning to transfer 17.5% of the shares - Economic Watch Network - Professional Financial News
On July 26, Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) released "an indicative announcement that State-owned shareholders intend to transfer part of the company's shares and rebrand cards by means of an open solicitation agreement".
The announcement states that, in order to further deepen the reform of State enterprises, optimize the restructuring of the State capital structure, and improve the structure of equity in the greenlands, the Shanghai Productions (Groups) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Productions") and Shanghai City Throws (Groups) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai City Throws") are to transfer part of the shares of the company held by means of an open solicitation of the concession, with the total share to be transferred not exceeding 17.5 per cent of the total stock in the Greenlands.
The price of the shares to be transferred this time is not less than the average of the arithmetical averages of the daily weighted average price for the first 30 trading days of the indicative announcement date (27 July 2020); and the value of each net asset audited by the company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investors in green land are still uncertain, and according to the bulletin's public information, it is estimated that the new strategic investors will have to pay about 14 billion yuan in money to take 17.5 per cent of the shares transferred in this greenfield mix.
It is worth noting that after the completion of this transfer of shares, the greenfield is expected to remain unheld shareholders and actual controllers, but the structure of control may change significantly.
Since its creation, the Greenlands Holdings has undergone a number of institutional institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, operating under the rules of marketability under a purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, the establishment and continuous improvement of shares in State-owned, employee-owned shares; from 2013 to 2015, the introduction of strategic investors to form State-owned and non-publicly owned cross-stocked, mixed ownership; and from 2015 to date, the overall listing became a public company.
The Greenfield's current mix-up scheme is similar to that of Glig, who in December 2019, in December 2019, the Takashi Capital-Leaved Seaming took over a 15 per cent stake in Gwig Electric (000651.SZ) for $41,662 million, Gwig Group retreated from small shareholders and completed the mix-up, implemented a senior incentive scheme, with modern business management methods such as an uncontrolled structure.
In Shanghai, Shanghai City pitches are fully owned by the Shanghai City Council of State, the chairman of the Greenlands Holdings, and President Zhang Yu Liang stated that the Greenlands initiative is an important step towards comprehensive reform of State enterprises in Shanghai, in line with party central requirements, to accelerate a new phase of reform of State enterprises, and that it fully demonstrates a new approach to reform, tailored to local conditions and tailoring, by introducing new strategic shareholders to listed companies, supporting businesses to further increase marketability, enhance the freedom of business management and accelerate the full release of reform dynamism.
The country's first inter-provincial car tour, the Xinhua Network.
On 25 July, at 1220 hours, over 200 Shanghai tourists travelling in D771 vehicles arrived successfully in Lan Creek, Zhejiang Province, the first cross-provincial (district, city) tour of the country since the Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed a cross-provincial (district, city) team tour on 14 July.
In the city of Lan Creek, in the middle-west of Zhejiang, the city has many famous attractions, such as the village of Zhuge Gossip, the underground Long River, and the village of Shigeku, and over 200 Shanghai tourists will take one look at these attractions during the two-day and one-night journey.
The Deputy General Manager of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Ltd., Lee Li, said that the company, in line with the latest policy, was focused on cross-provincial travel needs, approached the city of Lan Creek at the first time, and introduced the "Shanghai to Lan Creek" and the "Summer Reward Two Days Tour" products, which were sold out less than a week later.

Recently, we have seen the impact of cyber attacks on the business world.
The leak of data from such companies as Morgan Chase, Yahoo, Home Treasure and Taggit, resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars of losses.
A few more attacks like this, the world economy will collapse.
The public sphere is not immune.
From 2012 to 2014, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management had very serious data leaks.
Security clearances and fingerprint information were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also have heard that some government-funded hackers are trying to influence the results of general elections in some countries with stolen data.
The two most recent cases were the large-scale theft of data in the German Bundestag, and the theft of e-mails in the United States Democratic National Committee.
Cyber threats have affected our democratic process.
And there's a growing trend.
The more advanced computer technology, the more vulnerable the means we use to protect data.
In particular, a new computer technology, called quantum computers, uses microparticles from nature to significantly increase the computing capacity of computers.
Its ability to operate is so powerful that it can break through many of the encryption systems we use today.
So are we hopeless?
Shouldn't we start packing electronic survival equipment to meet the end of the coming data?
I don't think it's that far.
The quantum computer is still in the laboratory, and it takes years to get it done.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in the encryption field.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of safe communication.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we unlocked new skills and could create quantum effects that didn't exist in nature.
The idea of using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of cryptographic technology is exciting to me.
Today, some selected companies and laboratories, including mine, have advanced this technology to the stage of practical application.
That's right.
We're going to use quantum against quantum.
How?
First, let's get a quick look at the world of encryption.
You need a briefcase, you have some important papers to give to your good friend, James Bond, to lock it up and keep it safe.
Because these materials are top secret, we're going to use a super-advanced briefcase.
It's equipped with a special password lock, and once it's locked, it converts the contents of the file to random numbers.
So all you have to do is put the file in, lock it, and this time the file has been converted to random numbers, and you give this briefcase to James.
When the briefcase isn't delivered, you call him and give him the code.
Once he gets the briefcase, enters the password, the file is deciphered, it's perfect, and you've managed to pass a encrypted message to James Bond.
A funny example, but it illustrates the three points of encryption.
The password -- we call it an encrypted key.
You can imagine it as a password.
The phone that told James the code.
We call it a key pass.
This ensures that we can safely deliver the key to the designated location.
and locks used to encrypt and decrypt documents.
We call it an encrypted algorithm.
Through the key, it converts the contents of the file to random numbers.
A good algorithm can do this, and it's hard to break the code without the key.
The importance of algorithms is that if someone gets a briefcase and opens it, without the key, without knowing the encryption algorithm, it is impossible to read what's in the document.
All I got was some random numbers.
Most of the security systems rely on secure key delivery, passing the key to the right place.
However, the rapidly growing computational capacity endangers many of the key delivery methods we currently use.
For example, we're now applying a very wide range of systems — RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 40 million years to crack a 426-bit RSA key.
And in 1994, after only 17 years, the code was broken.
As computer performance grows, so does the password we need.
Now we often use a password of 2048 or 4096 bits.
As you can see, the battle between the encrypters and the decryptors is ongoing, all trying to win over each other.
Over the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers will solve the complex mathematical algorithms that are the basis of the encryption system we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our safe castle into a touchdown cardhouse.
We're trying to protect our castle.
Many research institutions have emerged in recent years to study how to use quantum effects to enhance encryption.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the three priorities of encryption, high-quality key, secure key transmission, and strong algorithms.
However, advances in science and engineering have jeopardized two of their priorities.
The first thing to do is the key.
. Random numbers are the basis for forming the key.
But by today, they're no longer really random.
Currently, we generate the key, based on random digital frequencies, generated by software, which we call pseudo-random numbers.
There's always some, maybe not that obvious pattern in the numbers generated by programs or mathematical methods.
The lower the randomity of these numbers, or, in terms of terminology, the lower the gills they contain, the easier they are to be predicted.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked in creative ways.
They shot the Tigers for a while, and then they analyzed them.
Cyber criminals use reverse engineering to create pseudo-random digital generators behind the turntable.
So they have a big chance of predicting the turn of the wheel, making a lot of money.
The key is also not safe.
Having a real random digital generator is important for creating a secure password.
For years, researchers have been trying to make real random digital generators.
But most designs, either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to repeat.
But the world of quantum is really random.
It's important to take advantage of this real randomity.
Devices capable of measuring quantum effects can generate constant random digital flows very quickly.
There's no more chance of the casino crime that I'm talking about.
Several universities and companies from around the world are focusing on making real random digital generators.
In my company, our quantum random digital generator was born on a 2-meter-long, 1-meter-wide optical table.
And then we narrow it down to a box size.
So far, it can be loaded onto a PCI card, plugged into a normal computer.
It's the fastest, really random digital generator in the world.
By measuring quantum effects, it can generate 1 billion random numbers per second.
Today has been widely used around the world to enhance the security of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
But even with a real random digital generator, we're facing the second big cyber security threat: the security transmission of the key.
The current key transfer technology can't fight quantum computers.
And the quantum solution to this problem, called quantum key distribution, is called QKD, which utilizes a base of quantum mechanics that violates instincts.
Watching microparticles is a behavior that changes this particle.
I'll give you an example.
Let's think about it again, and give the code to James Bond.
But this time, we don't call him, we use the quantum effect, we carry this code with a bunch of lasers, and we pass it to James via the normal fiber.
We assume Dr. Norr wants to get this code.
Fortunately, Dr. Noe will leave electronic fingerprints in the course of trying to intercept this quantum key, which James and you can detect.
This way, the key that is intercepted will be scrapped.
And the key that's left can provide a powerful protection for data.
Because this safety mechanism is based on the fundamentals of physics, quantum computers, or any future supercomputer, it's impossible to crack it.
I and my team are working with many top universities and defence departments to improve this exciting technology and develop next generation safety products.
The Internet of things heralds the advent of a highly interconnected era, with 25-30 billion devices expected to access the Internet by 2020.
If our society is going to function in a world where things are connected, then trust in these interconnected devices systems is crucial.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important in building this trust, and it will guarantee us the full enjoyment of these magical innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you.

Three-year-old kid college playgrounds were smashed and then sued for damages. Is it reasonable?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Daily Journal of the Rule of Law by Wang Si-seok Responsible Editor: Wang Si-seok
The scene was smashed, and the children were paid, and then they sued the school.
The correspondent of this newspaper, Zhao Yifan
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . while 3-year-old Wen was playing in a certain college playground, he was accidentally hit in the head by the softball team's Chen.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In recent days, the People's Court of the Haidian District of Beijing City, after hearing the case, concluded that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, that it had fulfilled its proper obligation of safety and that Chen had paid compensation, and that the plaintiff's claim had accordingly been rejected.
. . . . . . . . . during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Wen to play at the school playground, where he was on softball team training.
In order to avoid the risks involved, Mr. Wen, Mr. Wen and many other small friends and parents are operating within the safe zone designated by the softball team.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to the hospital for medical treatment and was diagnosed with a head trauma.
Mr. Wen argued that the facilities at the school field did not meet the relevant safety requirements and did not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The school's negligence led to the above-mentioned events, leading to great physical and psychological suffering, as well as to greater suffering for its family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In response, the school argued that it had set up a protective net in the playground and posted regulations, training notices, informing it that access to the playground must be safe from the training site and alerting itself to safety, and that the plaintiff could not prove that the school was "unfulfilled with safety and security obligations" and therefore did not agree to compensation.
The court considered that the site of the incident was the site where the university was free of charge open to the public, and that while the school had a safety and security obligation to manage the playground, such a safety and security obligation could only be met by a general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school had set up a protective net in the playground, having fulfilled its proper security obligations, and Chen had also paid Xiaowen more than $2,000 for various losses such as medical expenses, transportation costs and so on, in accordance with a previous compensation agreement, and the parties had agreed to a one-time settlement of the dispute.
After that, Xiao Wen's parents again claimed compensation for the school, and there was no legal basis for it, and the court decided to dismiss the plaintiff's entire claim.
After the sentence was pronounced, neither of the parties appealed, and the judgement is now in force.
Under article 37 of our law on liability for torts, schools, as administrators of public places, have a security obligation; in the case of injury to others caused by the actions of third persons, third persons bear responsibility for torts, while those in public places who fail to meet their security obligations should bear the corresponding supplementary responsibility.
The judge stated that, as administrators of public places, it was most likely to know the actual situation of the site as a whole, to anticipate the risks and damage that might occur, to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of loss or to mitigate the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the lowest costs of harm, and that the law imposed on them the corresponding obligation to safeguard the performance of social activities.
In this case, the school's security obligation should be adapted to the social activities it engages in for a specific group of people in the playground, which is open to the public free of charge, in particular by adopting basic security measures and having an obligation to inform about hidden risks.
In judicial practice, it is also inappropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on public sector administrators.
If the school has adopted a safety net and has fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be assumed that the school has no fault and should not be held legally liable.
In addition, in the case of third-person infringement, even if the managers of public places, such as schools, do not fulfil their duty of safety, their liability is a supplement to damages, and, under the recently enacted Civil Code, the administrator can also recover from the third person after assuming additional responsibility.
So in such an accident, the victim should not expand the scope of the claim after having received compensation from the direct infringer.
I'd like to show you today the way we make things in the future.
I believe our buildings and machines will soon be capable of self-assembling, self-replicating and self-remediation.
So I'm going to show you what I think is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years, half a million to a million parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years, two and a half million parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million types of protein that can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, and we can copy DNA with 3 billion base pairs in about an hour.
That's the complexity of our natural systems, but they're very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, more complicated than anything we can build.
They're more efficient in terms of energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can fix themselves and stay alive.
There's something really interesting about the natural system.
If we can convert it into our built environment, then the way we build things has great potential.
I think the key is self-assemble.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we're going to build -- our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences -- basically DNA that works in our buildings.
And then we need the programmable part, which accepts this sequence and is used for folding or remodeling.
We need some energy to activate, so that these parts of us can fold according to the procedure.
We need some kind of error redundancy to make sure that what we've built is what we want.
So, I'm going to show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I are doing to realize this self-assembled future.
The first two projects were MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale refactorable robots — 8 feet, 12 feet long proteins.
They are embedded in mechanical and electrical equipment, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold into a series of angles — negative 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, — something of this kind; a series of angles, or turns, which can be passed over with wires.
Each unit gets its own message -- like negative 120. It rotates, checks if it's in place, then passes the sequence to its neighbor.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, designers working on this project.
I think the project really revealed: Is it really scalable?
I mean, when thousands of people spend thousands of dollars making this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next question is looking at passivity, or passively trying to make the reorganization programmable.
But it goes one step further, and it tries to make actual calculations.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's with the non-door.
Each door to be used for calculation has a tetrahedral, with two input tetrahedrals.
One of them is input from the user, like you're building bricks.
The other is the input of a piece of brick that was put in before coming.
And then it gives the output of three-dimensional space.
This means that users pile bricks in the way they want.
It's calculated on the basis of what you've done before and your instructions.
Now it's moving within a three-dimensional space — up or down.
Look to the left,[1,1] the input equals 0 output, meaning down.
On the right, [0,0] the input is 1 output, which means up.
So what this really means is that our structure now contains the blueprint we want to build.
So the information about what you want to build is all embedded in it.
That means we have some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction, because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If there's a mistake, you can replace a part.
All local information is embedded in it and tells you how to fix it.
So you have something you can climb, you can read it and an output one by one.
It is directly embedded; there is no external instruction input.
The last project I'm going to show is called the eccentric chain, which is probably the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we're seeing now.
It has refactivability and programmability that makes it a completely passive system.
It's basically you've got a string of elements.
Every element is exactly the same, and they're partial.
Each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
If you want to assemble chains, you need to program it.
To tell each unit whether to make a left or a right turn.
When you shake this chain, it folds up programming any structure you encode for it -- so in this case, a spiral, fire, two connected cubes.
Basically you can program in three-dimensional space -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- the chain is completely passive.
What kind of future is this for us?
I think this tells us about the possibility of this self-assembling, self-replicating and self-remediation in our physical structure, our buildings and machines.
There is a new programmability in these parts.
From which you can get new possibilities for computing.
We'll have space to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all the bricks can actually be calculated.
What an amazing parallel and distributed computing ability and new design possibilities.
It's an exciting potential.
I think the projects I'm showing you are just a small step towards the future, if we achieve these new technologies for a new self-assembled world.
Thank you.

The enthusiasm of people to exercise fitness is high under the regularization of disease prevention and control.
The tourism market is about to recover as the cross-provincial tourism business is gradually liberalized.
The province of Fujian resumed its cross-provincial tourism operations from 21 July, and the first weekend after its opening saw a peak in passenger flow as a popular destination for tourism.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are a lot of tourists arriving on the weekends to travel to Xiamen.
The Xiamen railway station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer, while the airport traffic is dominated by students, tourism, and family visits.
The tourist market gradually warmed up, and in July, Xiamen Airport operated 440 flights daily, and domestic flights had recovered to 80 per cent before the outbreak.
The airline encrypted air speed lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, and Sian, and seized the recovered tourist market.
At present, several travel agencies in Xiamen are on the line for a series of summer in-country cross-provincial products, and team trips are mainly based on outdoor attractions.
In response to the train station, the summer passenger peak at the airport, the units involved have increased the number of people in areas where people are able to gather, such as the on-duty counter, the security checkway, and Fujian has also optimized the Eight Health Codes, achieving health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, contributing to an orderly recovery of the tourist market.
Could Liu Dehua Liu Qingyun "dismantling" the new spark-in-the Xinhua network?
The Bomb Demolition Specialist 2 recently announced that it would be released on December 24, becoming the first slotted film in the greeting slot.
The second one is still directed, produced and starred by Qiu Ryotao, Liu Dehua, and unfolded with a whole new story.
The addition of elements of the "nuclear bomb" in the second section is also known to make the challenge for this demolition specialist more difficult, with several flashing shots in the trailer that have been heartbroken, a massive explosion of mushroom clouds, an airport engulfed by fire, quite shocking.
Three years ago, the "demolition specialist" made by the original classman, decapitated the five-one box office championship of the year and received seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Illustrated Award, and Kew Ryotao X Liu Dehua became a gold partner in the audience's mind.
. . . . . . . . . . . . this time 'Expert 2' also gives rise to renewed expectation that this ace combination will be able to wipe out new sparks.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . to find the truth, he had to seek help from his best friend, Dong Zhuo, who was also an expert in bomb demolition.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

What the relationship was between the three men, what did Liu Dehua actually do at the Shantao Hotel and what was involved in, what the waves of his career as a bomb-dismantling expert had been, and the mysteries were curious.
It is understood that the film's major dramas are the field viewing of Hong Kong's world landmark architecture, together with the top special effects production team, which brings shock real visual shocks.

Do you know how many flowering plants there are?
There are 250,000 species -- at least as many as we know -- of a quarter of a million flowering plants.
And flowers are trouble.
It's really hard to make plants grow.
It takes a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why do you bother so much?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, gender.
I know what's in your head when you look at these pictures.
There are many other ways in which plants can reproduce.
It can be done by plugs; it can reproduce in the same gender; it can pollinate in the same strain.
But they do need to spread their genes and mix them with other genes so that they can be ecological.
That's how evolution works.
Now the way the plant transmits this message is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a scanning electron microscope that can see these.
There are many species of flowering plants and there are many different types of pollen.
It's actually quite useful for forensics and so on.
It's a very inefficient process, and that's why pollen always runs into our noses.
Because most of them have been abandoned, hoping that the reproductive cells contained in pollen, male reproductive cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All the grass, that means all the grain, and most of the trees spread pollen by wind.
But most species actually use insects to complete the process, which is, in a way, smarter, because it doesn't require too much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen and move it directly to where it is needed.
Obviously, we noticed the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship, whether a bird or a bee, and they get a return, which is usually nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship can lead to fantastic adaptive changes -- red skirt little moths are a beautiful adaptive change.
The plants also have harvests, and the sac spread pollen elsewhere.
The plant evolved, creating landing runways everywhere, and the bees could be lost.
There's something on many plants that looks like a mark on other insects.
These are lilies' pollen cysts, which are very clever, so when the unknowing insects fall on it, the pollen cysts turn around, with a lot of pollen hitting on the back of the insects, so that they can follow the insects to other plants.
There's a orchid that looks like it's got a jaw. In a way, it does; it forces the insect to crawl over, rub the pollen, and take the pollen somewhere else.
The Orchid: At least 20,000 species of orchids -- a wide variety of amazing.
They have a variety of tricks.
They have to try and attract pollinators to help them finish the process.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, was studied by Darwin and gave a fantastic prediction when he saw this orchid.
Basically what insects have to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it stabs the mouthpiece into the middle part and all the way down to know the nectar tube to get the nectar.
And Darwin said, "Look at this flower, I guess there's something that's evolved with it."
No doubt, it's an insect.
I mean, it's usually curled up, but after it's stretched out, it looks like this.
Now imagine that if nectar, something of such value, is very expensive for plants to produce and attract many pollinators, then, as in human sex, people may begin to cheat each other.
They might say, "I have some nectar.
It's a plant.
This plant is a favorite of South African insects who evolved a long mouthpiece to obtain nectar at the bottom.
It's an imitator.
This plant is imitating the former plant.
There's a fly with a long mouth, and it doesn't get any nectar from the impersonator, because the impersonator doesn't give it any nectar.
So, not only did the fly not get nectar from the fake plant, but -- if you look very closely at the top of the head, you'll see there's some pollen that's going to spread to other plants, if the botanist doesn't come over and stick it to a blue card.
This lie spreads throughout the plant kingdom.
These flowers with black dots: they may look like black dots to us, but I tell you, for the male insects of the appropriate species, it looks like two very, very sexy females.
And when the insect arrives and lands on it, it immerses itself into pollen, which, of course, will be taken to other plants, and if you look at the images of a scanning electron microscope that every family should have, you can see that there are actually some patterns there, three-dimensional patterns.
It even makes insects feel comfortable, and it looks good.
These electron microscopy images -- this is an orchid disguised as an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures for our eyes, and that insects may feel very, very different textures.
This orchid evolved to imitate the metallic glossy surface seen in some beetle.
Under the scanning electron microscope, you can see this surface -- it's very different from the other surfaces we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics as an insect, even if we look like an insect.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It's wonderful and magical.
It's called a black quartz.
I think it's subtle sometimes.
For the kind of bees that fit, it looks like another very aggressive bee, which will fly over and hit it with its head many times, trying to drive it away, of course, and it'll put pollen on it.
Another thing it does is this plant imitates as another food orchid rich in in insects.
But there's nothing.
So it cheats on two levels -- it's incredible.
We've seen Elan, the part with a strong scent.
I actually smelled it before.
These flowers don't actually have to be so glamorous.
They spread wonderful fragrances to attract any interested insects.
This flower doesn't smell good.
This flower actually smells very ugly, and again, it's evolved, it looks like rotting meat.
That's why the fly likes it.
The fly flies in and pollinates it.
This is White Star tarta, also known as Dead Horse tarta.
I don't know what the dead horse smells like, but this flower may smell very much.
It's terrible.
The green head flies can't help themselves.
Fly into it, all the way into it.
Laying eggs on top, which is considered a very good piece of rotting meat, without realizing that there is no food for eggs here, these eggs will die here, but at the same time this plant will benefit, because the hard fur is loose and the fly disappears, pollinating to another flower -- it's amazing.
It's a sea tart plant, a European sea tarta, and a Zephyr, called a long-age weed in this country.
I shot this in Dorset last week.
This guy's heating up to about 15 degrees higher than the ambient temperature -- incredible.
If you look inside it, behind the meat ear is something a little like a dam, the fly is attracted to heat -- it's a boiling volatile chemical, the little bug -- and they're trapped under this container.
They drink sweet nectar and then they all get a little sticky.
They're covered in pollen at night, sprayed down by them, and then the hard hairs we see up there become so dull that these pollen-filled little bugs are able to escape -- it's incredible.
If you think it's incredible, this one's my favorite.
It's spring feather green.
Those who are here from Brazil should have known about this plant.
It's the most amazing thing.
It's brilliant. It's about a foot long.
It has an ability, as far as I know, not to have any other plant, and when it blooms -- it's in the middle of the meat ear -- for about two days, it produces some degree of metabolic change, some similar mammal.
It doesn't have starch, it's plant food, it has something very brown-like fat that burns it at the rate of burning fat, metabolism, about the speed of a kitten.
By weight ratio, it's twice the energy output of hummingbirds -- absolutely amazing.
It also did something unusual.
Not only will it rise to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Celsius, two days, but it will remain constant.
One of them is a temperature-regulating mechanism used to keep the temperature constant.
Why would you do that? I heard you ask.
You don't know yet, some crustaceans like to mate at this temperature.
They're in there, covered in pollen.
Plants fill them with pollen, let them leave, let them pollen.
What a wonderful thing it is.
Now we think most pollinators are insects, but actually in the tropical regions, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, because butterflies and birds are similar to us, and we think, can see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, the birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and UV, and they see all kinds of dark UVs.
There's some color behind this.
"If we could see those colors, wouldn't it be nice?" I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert lichens, half-day flowers, in Dorset.
As we can see, these are little yellow flowers, all over the place.
It looks like this in visible light.
If removing the red looks like this.
Most bees can't feel the red.
And then I put a UV filter in front of my camera, under a specific frequency of UV, and I got this picture for a long time.
It's like a real amazing target.
Now we don't know what the bees actually see, and when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We can't know what's going on in there, either in insects, or in the minds of other humans.
But the contrast seems to be this way... from the background.
It's another small flower -- located in different UV frequency zones, different filters to match different pollinators.
It looks like this.
To avoid you think that all yellow flowers have this attribute -- no damage to the flowers during the filming; just stick it on the tripod, and don't take it off -- in ultraviolet light, look at this.
This serves as the basis for sunscreen, because sunscreen works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So perhaps there is some use of the chemical in it.
Finally, it's a night comedy that was sent to me by the Norwegian Bjorn Rorslett -- a fantastic hidden pattern.
I like the way it's hidden.
I think it's poetic, and these pictures were taken with ultraviolet filters, the main purpose of which was to be used by astronomers to shoot Venus -- actually the cloud on Venus.
This is the main use of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and reproduction, which is the word of flowers.
Just as the flowers spend so much energy trying to attract pollinators to their invitation, somehow they have succeeded in convincing us that it contains rich content and that we send each other flowers, especially at weddings, when you think of it, just within this moment genetic matter is moving from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

The 53-year-old Lee Daigo, interviewed by a reporter, said that grandpas were fishing in the Dragon Creek River, that they had been fishing with their father since he was 11 years old, shaking small boats, walking along the Dragon Creek River, going up to Chongqing Liangping, and down to a long life, each time they left the home, it was ten and a half months to live on fish.
Since 1997, however, as the rural population gradually flows into the town, the population of the town of Gauan is increasing, and the resulting environmental pollution is increasing.
A paper mill, a chemical plant, a farm, and pollution of the river were built along the Dragon Creek River.

From 1 January 2020, the City of Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and the relevant waters of the main urban area have been completely banned from fishing.
According to Chongqing City Development Reform Commission data, to date, Chongqing City has accumulated 3403 retrieved fishing vessels and has signed a repulsion agreement of 4643 fishing vessels, accounting for 63.3 per cent of the total three-year mission, and 86.3 per cent.

As a next step, the city of Chongqing will carry out a number of specific remediation actions to accelerate the clean-up of the Yangtze main stream line using the project, complete a new round of Yangtze entry sewage surveys and carry out the corresponding clean-up operations, complete essentially the "triphosphorus" (in reference to phosphorus mines, phosphorus chemicals and phosphorus plaster banks), clean-up of small hydropower, advance the Yangtze reforestation initiative on both sides of the Yangtze, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the illegal dry stream docks of the Yangtze, and conduct a special remediation exercise for illegal sand mining, and further advance the interdiction of the Yangtze basin.
Israel strengthens repeated control of the outbreak - the new and medium-sized network

Israel strengthens repeated control of the outbreak
In the early stages of the outbreak of the new corona pneumonia outbreak, the effectiveness of Israel's anti-control measures was evident.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on preventive measures, there has recently been a marked increase in the number of new coronary pneumonia confirmed in Israel, and the Government of Israel has taken urgent measures on several occasions to strengthen prevention and control of the outbreak.
On 28 February, the first new case of corona pneumonia was confirmed in Israel proper, with the prompt adoption of the closure of all entry and exit points, the suspension of non-essential industries, the change of schools to online instruction, restrictions on public transport and non-essential social activities, the closure of cities with severe outbreaks, and joint military and police defence and control initiatives.
This series of measures soon yielded positive results, and by mid-May, new confirmed cases of corona pneumonia in Israel had fallen back to a single digit on a single day.
As the outbreak was brought under control, Israel's preventive measures were completely undecoded, and since June, the number of new coronary pneumonia cases has gradually rebounded.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . especially after entering July. . . . . .
The number of new cases in Israel in recent days is over 1,500 for eight days, and as of the time of the 25th of July, 916 new cases had been registered that day.
As of 25 July, there were 59745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the outbreak, the Government of Israel has taken urgent measures on several occasions to strengthen the prevention and control of the outbreak.
On 6 July, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli Government closed public entertainment venues such as gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and, at the same time, introduced a public transport restriction policy, which provided that no more than 20 passengers per bus could be transported.
On 17th, a series of new restrictions were announced by the Government, including the implementation of the "City Seal" on weekends, providing for the "City Seal" to be implemented between 1700 and 500 hours on Fridays and Sundays.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . during this period, the people can go out, but places such as shops, shopping centres, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibitions, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets, pharmacies, etc. will remain open.
At the same time, within all dates and periods, venues such as assemblies, gymnasiums, studios, etc., where more than 10 people are prohibited, restaurants and cafés are closed, and only takeout services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli population has not paid enough attention to the severity of the epidemic and has failed to work with the Government in combating it.
In the wake of the Israeli outbreak, many people went to the streets to protest the march because of the government ' s control measures that affected their own economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-septic policy had an impact on the economy.
In the evening of the 21st, thousands more protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest that Prime Minister Netanyahu had issued protective measures such as a ban on restaurants, cafés, etc. without corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not observe the requirement of wearing masks when they are operating outdoors, maintaining a safe social distance of two metres, and in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their jaws or hang them on their wrists.
During the recurrent outbreak, the school was the worst affected area for the spread of the new coronavirus, and a recent visit by journalists to the kindergarten found that neither teachers nor students in the kindergarten wore masks as required by the Government, nor maintained a safe social distance of two metres to each other, burying the pitfalls of a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council's expert advisory mission to combat the outbreak, believes that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation", noting that the current Israeli outbreak prevention and control measures are not sufficient and that all leisure, recreational sites and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the outbreak.
. Waxman stated that Israel lacked an overall plan to combat the outbreak, and that parliaments and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach agreement on the fight against the outbreak, and establish clear steps to include related restrictions in different sectors.

Despite these two years of inconvenience, Da Tinfu, 77 years old, was counting on "to come here fortnightly, to have an addiction."
This is an eyeless yard in the former state of the city of solidahara, unlike the general farm house, where the Qin cavity is often transmitted, along with wonderful skin scenes, embroidered works, traditional Qin cavities, brows, etc.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he loved skin shadows and sang the play and began planning to build a cultural complex.
With the Liangyun Cultural Complex, the villagers' cultural life became rich and colorful.
The journalist has not yet entered Liang Yun Cultural Complex, and the Qin-clad tune has been passed out.
It's the neighboring village villagers Brexiang who are singing the Qin leg for the folks.
She has loved the Qin cavity since she was a child and is now known locally, and as long as she has some free time, she will come to the cultural complex to perform for her countrymen.
Recently, Brexia also played live on the Internet.
"There's a stage for more people to see themselves perform. It's a happy thing. "

The compound also contains over 300 items of agricultural tools, traditional and handmade tiles, paper clippings, embroidery, leather shadows, etc. from different years.

Why does a common farmer build a cultural complex?
"Picture is my home graft, which I have been learning from since I was 15. "
The Liangyun Cultural Complex was established in 2012 as the first rural "Intangible Cultural Heritage Pavilion" in Ningxia and a model compound for the conservation of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in the city of solidahara.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Complex, the former State District of the City of Solida has more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups, of which there are over 50 on a certain scale, such as the Shen Jia River Cultural Complex, Wang Yonghong Cultural Complex, Yanglang Cultural Complex, which covers the townships and streets of the former State, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grasshoppers are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better, traditional culture can't just be left behind. "

In recent years, the reddishness of plays such as "The Mask" and "The kite" has proved that the battle-type plays have a strong life force.
. . . . . . . . . unlike previous inquiring works, "winner" looks the world, extending the story's background to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
In the context of the final phase of the 1944 anti-Japanese war, it tells the story of the Chinese Communist Party's secret intelligence staff, Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong dynasty), who, under the leadership of the Secretary-General of the Chinese underground party Lin River Province and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carried out the "Mudanura" plot of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not fit to be a spy, "The spy is supposed to be the kind of person who can't find it at all, and if it's the kind of person who can't afford to look at you, can you sneak?" There's a line in the kite, "If you don't come get me, I'll forget that I'm a nationalist," and the spy is going to be elite. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The other side of the "winner" was supported by the Japanese Fukuhara, played by Li Li Li, and the police chief Fang Shibao, played together.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The director Yin Fei used the word "spring" to describe the play's rivalry between Li Li Liqing and Liu Yunlong, "absolutely a sprint, and they are particularly close to each other, and this kind of adhesion in them is very powerful to me. Many times their plays are ‘current', such as we write only half-pages of paper, and I don't yell when I shoot them, and they can continue to perform. "

Director Yin Fei introduced the road, "There's no bad root in these two people, they're just in that era, and that environment is flowing with the waves."
The Yoo Yunlong also offered, "We're going to have someone's taste, which means that there must be good and bad people around me, and bad people are enemies, but we're going to develop them, and our team will grow."
The endings of the two men in the play were also carefully designed, and he was confident that a satisfactory response would be given to the audience.

4 students drowned in NIM's Ah-young flag. Official: The incident sounded alarms - the new net.
On the evening of July 26, Chinese New Network Hurlenbel (journalist Lee Ayiping), journalists were informed by the government of Ahung Fong in the city of Huronbel, an autonomous region of Inner Mongolia, that four local students had died unfortunately as a result of drowning.
On 24 July, at 1550 hours, the Arnze Public Security Bureau received a call that six junior high school students drowned.
After taking the police, the local civilian police arrived at the scene first and rescued two students on the spot, followed by units such as the local emergency authorities, the Water Department and others, who were involved in the rescue.
The rescue scene was described as a total of more than 80 people, including security police officers, Sen police officers, fire and medical personnel, sending three rubber boats to continuously salvage the surrounding waters and hiring specialized rescue teams to arrive at the site to conduct underwater searches through sonar detection.
On 25 July, at 0640 hours, local rescue workers found the first student to be killed, the second student to be killed at 1130 hours, the third student to be killed at 1240 hours on 25 July, and the last student to be killed at 1334 hours on 25 July, after the above four were salvaged to shore, and confirmed by the local 120 emergency centre that there were no vital signs.

At present, the relevant departments of the local government are putting together some knowledge of the prevention of drowning, in the hope that the tragedy will not happen again.
The Director of the Hong Kong SAR Government's Department of Finance and Economics and Treasury, Hsu Jung Woo, said that Hong Kong's financial markets remained active and functioning in an orderly manner.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
At an online seminar organized by Hong Kong's Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong (General Council of Canada) on 24 (Toronto time), Xu Jong-woo stated that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation as a result of the "rehabilitation of windwaves" and the new coronae pneumonia outbreak.
The Hong Kong dollar exchange price is stable and tends to the level of the firm's exchange guarantee.
There is no clear indication of financial outflows from the banking system, but, on the contrary, more than $11 billion has been inflow since June.
The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase over the past few months, with a series of open equity fund-raising activities in the stock market, with market transactions rising.
Shun Jong-woo said that the new corona pneumonia outbreak had put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remained the same.
The many advantages that Hong Kong has, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, the free flow of information and funds and simple low taxes, have kept Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.

In order to support the development of financial science and technology, the HKSAR Government has also launched the "Ten Thousand Plan" to fund local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial science and technology-related business, in order to create 1,000 new jobs, employ local talent and enrich Hong Kong's financial science and technology pool.
In looking to the future, Xu Jong-woo expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian businesses to make good use of Hong Kong's strengths and its position as an international financial centre, the International Centre for Asset and Wealth Management and the Global Offshore RMB Business Hub to develop and invest in the Australasia Bay Region and surrounding areas of Port-au-Prince.
The Willow Blade has praised China for its efforts to combat the disease and has encouraged countries to learn from their experiences - China's New Network.
The 25th Journal of the Lancet magazine states that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a similar size to Europe or the United States, is effectively under control at this stage of the new coronae outbreak without any further widespread transmission, largely controlling the outbreak in the country.
The article states that China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction for nearly a decade, which has allowed China to prepare for the new crown much more than it did for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of the year.
According to the author, at the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, Chinese preparations were initially inadequate, especially as the pathogen was uncertain.
When a new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on 11 January 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had articulated the clinical characteristics of the virus, warning the world of the threat of a new coronavirus through research papers published on the Willow Blade.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, which was carried out very quickly and strictly in the context of a state of emergency declared by the State, through close cooperation within the country, and in May and July, respectively, the results of the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China were published on the Willow Blade.
The experience of China shows that it is important to invest in national health and research systems and effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are very worthy of learning and learning.
In addition, the Chinese experience has shown that, on the basis of strong research, a strong high level must decisively rely on scientific evidence to make the right decisions, which makes the new coronae outbreak effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its value and act on it in the most socially beneficial way.
In the early days of the outbreak, the Chinese National Guard commissioned three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new coronavirus, and their recommendations provided the basis for the decision of the Wuhan "seal" on 23 January; when experts suggested the necessity and urgency of building a square hospital, the government soon took a decision and quickly implemented it; and, at the same time, the wide participation of communities and the masses made the outbreak quickly and effectively under control.
The article concludes by emphasizing the need for countries to strengthen global cooperation and joint responses in response to global health emergencies.

A two-year-old child in the house suffered only minor injuries and was safely rescued.
The rest of the households in the house were not injured in the accident, but the mood was still uneven.
The live footage reported by the Agence de France-Presse shows that at one point the house that was hit by the accident had a rolling smoke and that the firefighters were able to see serious damage to the house after putting out the fire.
At present, the cause of the plane crash is not clear.
The Rhine Post, citing police accounts, reported that there were clues that the aircraft had broken down or had crashed into a residential building.
The police say that several parts of the crash aircraft were found around the scene of the accident.
The German criminal police are working with the Duisburg prosecution, the German Federal Aviation Accident Investigation Agency, to investigate the causes of the accident.
The same day, journalists learned from the Chinese Consulate-General in Düsseldorf that the building had contacted the local police and fire services, and that according to the scene, none of the casualties were Chinese citizens.

The Singapore Interdepartmental Working Group against the epidemic has said recently that the Singapore Government is stepping up testing for the last few dedicated accommodations for foreign workers with higher rates of new crown infection.
The vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work after completing testing in all dedicated dormitories, but they will still have to conduct new crown testing on a regular basis.
The director of Tai Peng, "The Goodness" has entered the Golden Lords Award-Sinhua.
On 18 July, the twenty-third Shanghai International Film Festival published the official list of selected films for the Gold Lords Award.
The first reality film by director Tai Peng, "The Goodness of the Day", was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Lord of this last festival, while the film officially released its first poster.
Posters, tablets and tablets
the film is the first realistic piece of work by Big Peng's director and his second-degree relationship with the Golden Lord's Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who wonders about how to go back to his home in the northeast countryside, hoping to make a literary film about how to make a family over the years, and as a result suffers a series of accidents.

According to director Dai Peng, the creation of the "grateful" came from a series of changes in the family during the shooting, which had to be accompanied by changes in the original shooting plan, and the life without the script was eventually recorded as a film, but released tension beyond the design.
How can the director Tai Peng face this "spirit" and how can he continue to face the changes that it brings?
There is no doubt that "grateful" is an experimental, almost all-American lineup and innovative audio-visual style that transforms life in front of the lens into a film, and that, under the wrap of real images, viewers will also find a shadow of themselves and their families from the family that the film presents, as the family party falls on in the film, calling for a series of reflections.

This year, where the average temperature is less than a dozen degrees, a line of simple barracks stands at the mountain pass, with the camp not far from a flag on the wind, and the warriors are on duty daily in the wind, while regular patrols are required to the higher elevations.
The warriors climbed up the steep slopes of the muddy rocks and needed hands and feet to use them.

Beijing consumption season restart - Xinhua Network
The city of Beijing relaunched its activities for the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principles of "full reboot, focused planning, orderly advance, and closely organized".
On July 26, 1.5 million government spending coupons were issued, of which 1 million were underline catering coupons, 500,000 were smart product coupons, and consumers were able to collect them from the Kyoto APP.
The deputy director of the Beijing City Business Bureau, Liu Mei Ying, presented at a press conference held in 25 years, and the restarted consumption season further reduced enterprise ration based on maintaining the existing level of preferential subsidies for consumer coupons.
Starting in early August, the current 1:1 ration of government and business funding was adjusted to 2:1, for example, if the original consumer received a card package to store consumption, it would benefit from a $120 concession, of which the government subsidized $60 and the enterprise contributed $60; the adjusted government subsidised $80 and the enterprise gave $40.
During the consumption season, the three main operators will subsidize flows and terminals around 5G consumption, further advancing Beijing 5G's new infrastructure and 5G's new consumption.
Chen Mo Bo means that Hong Kong's economy has been hit again by the outbreak.
On July 26, Hong Kong, Chinese news agency Chen Mobo, Director of Finance of the Hong Kong SAR Government, said that Hong Kong was facing the impact of the new coronary pneumonia outbreak on the new wave, and that commercial transactions and economic activities, which had initially seen a slight recovery, had also been hit.
The government of the Region has renewed its call to owners, both large and small, to cut their rents and to spend time with retailers, and to eat and share with small and medium-sized enterprises.
The day Chen Mobo published an article on the Internet entitled "The rugged path to recovery".
He said that Hong Kong's recent number of confirmed cases of new corona pneumonia was high, that the situation was dire, that it affected the livelihood of society, and that it was disturbing the economy.
In case of repeated outbreaks, first and foremost, the case of strict-proof input and the most rapid handling and disruption of the viral transmission chain; when the outbreak is under control, economic activity should be resumed accordingly, as appropriate.
He noted that in the face of the impact of a new wave of outbreaks, commercial transactions and economic activity, which had seen a slight recovery, had also been hit.
. Social responsibility is equally important for the business community, beyond the contractual spirit, especially for those groups that receive large government subsidies in the Secure Employment Scheme.
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong remained critical in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to have slowed slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that the external situation in Hong Kong remains critical.
. . . . . . Chen Mobo said that Hong Kong's past decades of development had shown that every crisis had hidden new opportunities, and every difficulty had hidden the keys to future development.
One winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I drove to work, I found the city covered in fog.
I drive through there almost every day, but this time it's unusual, and I've never seen anything like it before.
Johannesburg is known for its uniquely beautiful skyline, but it was barely visible that morning.
Soon I realized that what I saw was a very serious haze caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment that I knew in the old days and the skylines that are clouded by the fog at this moment, is in my heart.
I'm afraid it's very likely that the once colored sundown beauty will be consumed by the dark fog.
At that moment, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I can't just stand by.
The biggest challenge is, I don't know about environmental science, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm pretty sure I can't solve atmospheric pollution by coding.
What kind of person am I going to solve this problem?
I'm just a town boy.
In the next few years, I've learned a very important lesson, and if we want to achieve a better future, we should all keep that lesson in mind.
Even if you're not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may have implied ways of solving problems in that area.
Sometimes, the unique perspective you hold can inspire unconventional thinking and thus shape the situation, but you need to be bold to try.
It's the only way you can know the results.
What I knew at the time, if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution, so I was a student again.
I did some basic research, and soon learned that atmospheric pollution is the greatest environmental health risk in the world.
World Health Organization data show that in 2012, almost 14 per cent of deaths worldwide were caused by atmospheric pollution in and around households, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
Atmospheric pollution causes higher mortality than malaria and AIDS each year.
In Africa, premature deaths due to unsafe sanitary conditions, or deaths due to malnutrition among children, appear pale in the face of atmospheric pollution, while at the same time it brings with it enormous economic costs: according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, expenditures in 2013 exceeded $400 billion.
In my work, I explore the technological frontier of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, and find a useful foothold and help us make better decisions.
When I think about the problem of atmospheric pollution, things become clear about how to deal with it, and we need to find better ways to make better decisions, considering the magnitude of the problem, it's very necessary to work together.
So I decided to meet some people who work in this field.
I started a conversation with officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I called people who were completely strangers but related.
These experiences of my involvement helped me to understand this more deeply.
And help me avoid the trap that sometimes falls when people in my line try to innovate: to quickly adopt a technology before they really have the problem.
I started thinking, what can I do to improve this situation?
I'm beginning to ask myself how to effectively integrate my knowledge skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the professional skills of the people I'm talking to.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends and make projections to judge what can happen.
I'm sure my idea can be a realistic solution, but I'm also faced with uncertainty, and I can't guarantee it's going to work.
All I've got is a set of specific engineering skills, skills from my work. Of course, for people who have been working in the field of atmospheric pollution for years, my skills are brand new.
I've come to realize that sometimes a new perspective, a new skill mix, can trigger something extraordinary.
Our will and imagination are a beacon that directs us to cross the barrier and start a new chapter.
I had a deeper understanding of atmospheric pollution, looking for atmospheric pollution data for the last decade or so, as well as for weather data in and around Johannesburg... and then, along with my colleagues in South Africa and China, I created air quality resolution support systems and uploaded them to the cloud.
This software can analyze historical and real-time data to reveal trends in pollution over time and space.
We then learned technology with a new machine, a few days in advance, predicting future pollution.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their daily travels and where they settle with their families.
We can anticipate adverse pollution events in advance, define the source of heavy pollution, and allow the authorities concerned to give instructions to adjust their operations.
By supporting scenario planning, urban planners can also make better decisions on how to expand infrastructure work, such as settlement in industrial areas.
We've established a pioneer pilot of the technology, running for 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
Our expected results have been validated, and the predicted data that we've shown and the data we've collected in the field show a close correlation.
Through our management, we introduced the world ' s leading sophisticated instruments to predict atmospheric quality, and its resolution and correctness rates were unprecedented, so that the city that I sailed into in the early winter morning could benefit... when I said to myself, "Something's wrong, I have to do something about it. "
So, the point is, what if I didn't study the problem of atmospheric pollution in the first place?
What if I didn't focus on the state of the country's environment, but rather on certain places, and some other people were in charge of these things?
What I've learned from this is that it's important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequences of inaction, as we all believe in a career.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should inspire us to go further.
So wherever you are in the world, next time, when you find out that you're born into some sort of curiosity is aroused, and it's also about what you want, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if it's not your field of expertise, ask yourself: why don't you try it?
Why don't you try your best, in your own way?
You might have an unexpected pleasure.
Thank you.

A lot of people think driving is something that can only be done by those who can see it.
Blind people wanted to drive a car safe and separate until now, also considered an impossible task.
Hello, I'm Dennis Hung, and we created a car for people with visual impairments for the freedom and independence of blind people.
Before I talk about this blind car, let me briefly say another project I've ever done, called the U.S. Department of Defense's Senior Research Planning Bureau City Challenge.
It's about making a mechanical car that can drive on its own.
You press the start button and don't touch anything again, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
At the 2007 Challenge, our team won half a million dollars to win third place in the game.
Around that time, the National Association of the Blind, or the Blind Association, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would allow the blind to drive independently and safely.
We thought we'd try it, because we thought, hey, it'd be hard to get there.
We've got an automatic car.
All we have to do is let the blind drive inside, so it's over, right?
But we're wrong.
What the Blind Association wants is not a car that can travel around blind people, but a car that blind people can choose and manage.
So we had to give up everything we had to do from the beginning.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a small sandmill prototype to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited a lot of blind young people across the country and gave them a chance to take a ride with this car.
It's definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with this car is that it is designed to allow blind people to drive in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot -- even on a small road made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take an important next step to create a real car that could travel on the real road.
How does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complicated system, but let me explain, let me simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have a sensory phase, a computational phase, and a non-visual interface.
The driver is obviously invisible, so the system must be able to sense the surroundings and collect data for the driver.
And this, we use the initial measurement component.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like human ears, inner ears.
I combined this information and GPS to predict the location of the vehicle.
We also use two cameras to detect the path of the car.
We also use three laser rangers.
The laser scan environment is used to detect obstacles -- the front, the rear leaning vehicle, and any obstacles on the way in, any obstacles around the vehicle.
All the mass information goes on to the computer, which will do two things.
First of all, one thing is to process the information to understand the surroundings -- which are pathways, which are obstacles -- and translate it to the driver.
It's also very intelligent to figure out the safest way to travel.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the vehicle's running program.
But the question is, how can we get information and instructions to the blind fast and accurate enough to make sure he can drive?
For this reason, we have designed many different non-visual user interface technologies.
The original three-dimensional flat acoustic system, vibrating vests, acoustic gears, leg belts, and even shoes that pressure the feet.
But today we're talking about three of these non-visual user interface techniques.
The first interface is called the driver handle.
It's a pair of gloves, and at the finger section it has vibrating components so that you can transmit instructions on how to travel -- direction and range.
Another device is called the speed belt.
This chair -- actually, it's a massage chair.
We take it apart, we recombine the vibration components of different models, we let them transmit information on speed, and there are instructions on how to use the gas doors and brakes.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the surroundings... because you can't see the vibrations, we actually have red glowing diodes on the driver, so he can see what's happening.
This is the sensor data, which is transmitted from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, driving handles and speed bands, are very effective.
But the problem is, these are instructions suggesting devices.
So that's not really freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, brake.
I call this a co-pilot problem.
So we're avoiding instructions suggesting devices, and focusing more on information devices.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called an empty chart.
Look at this as a blind monitor.
It's a small desktop, with a lot of holes on it, and compressed air is excluded from it, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're blind, you put your hand on it, you can feel the course of behavior and the obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency of releases in the air, possibly the temperature.
This is actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here, you can see left, right and right cameras and how the computer pars and transmits this information to the blanks.
That's it, we're showing a simulation program, and a blind man is driving with an empty chart.
This program has been very helpful in training blind drivers on different types of non-visual user interfaces and in rapidly testing different theories.
That's basically how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it won't get on the road unless it turns out to be as safe as today's cars, or safer.
I'm so sure it's gonna happen.
But does society, is it possible for them to accept this radical idea?
What are we going to do with insurance?
How do we get a driver's license?
There are many different obstacles behind the technology challenge that we need to address before it really becomes a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car driven by blind people.
But what's potentially more important than that is the enormous value inherent in the byproducts of this project.
Sensors that can be used to see the darkness, the rain fog.
And this new type of interface, we can use these technologies to make them a safer vehicle for the visual population.
Or for the blind, a domestic device that lives on a daily basis -- educational facilities, office facilities application services.
Imagine the teacher writing notes on the blackboard in the classroom, and blind students can use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher wrote.
It's extremely precious.
Today, what I'm showing you is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)

The Chinese Doctor set up a tribute to the anti-septic hero Xinhua.
In recent days, with respect to the Chinese filmmaker's hero against the disease, the chairman of the Bona Film Group in Winter, director Liu Weiqiang (Tu Zhu Zhou), spoke with the Zhongnanshan faculty in Guangzhou about the production of the film "Doctor of China" on the subject of the disease.
The Bona cinema industry wishes to pay tribute to all the medical, anti-septic workers who fought on the first line of outbreak control by the Chinese Doctor!
In 2021, the film will be released nationally as a tribute film celebrating the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Communist Party of China.
At present, the Bona Film Industry is being deployed under the auspices of the Chinese Ministry of Public Information and the National Film Agency, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau, organized the film "China's captain" from the original class to make the film "Chinese Doctor", a film reflected in the strong leadership of the party's centre that unites the people of the country to fight the outbreak of the new corona pneumonia.
The film focuses on Wuhan's anti-prevalence line, using Wuhan medical personnel and provincial and municipal aid teams as the character's background, using unique narratives from a human perspective, as well as extremely powerful lens languages, and the panorama displays a moving story of Chinese medical personnel with dedication and sacrifice on the anti-prevalence line.
It is understood that, in the first days of Wuhan's day of defunct, Bona will overcome the difficulties by sending a crew of picks into the outbreak, exchanging information face-to-face with hundreds of medical workers and gathering information, and that interviews have now been conducted with the most valuable first-hand video material on the anti-septic front, such as the Zhongnanshan Academyman himself, Guangzhou's first person to assist Wuhan, Guangdong Aido Medical Team, and Wuhan's Golden and Silver Tung-chung Hospital, Wuhan Association and Hospital, Wuhan University's Naknan Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital, and others.
The Zhongnan Mountain Academy also offered its expectations and hopes for the film to be filmed at this symposium: " I look forward to seeing not only some of the more exposed experts, but also more of the medical personnel who are in pain on the front line, most of them. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"There is still some misunderstanding of China by some friends abroad. "
When it comes to the dissemination of the film, the Zhongnan Mountain Academy says that some people abroad are currently fond of politicizing the virus, and he hopes that the film will impress the audience from a human perspective: " It is better to show the film abroad, in addition to the Chinese screening, to impress the audience with a true human spirit in a way that is understandable to both domestic and international audiences.

The head of the exhibition area introduced the distinction between red industry and red cultural industry development.
The red industrial exhibition area displays 31 exhibits from 6 businesses, such as the Walling Steel, the Waring Line, and the Xing Power, and the red cultural industry development exhibition area displays nearly 200 products in 27 units, such as the red series books, red series foods, and red series literary products.
. In the Yanan extension area, many visitors are attracted to the show's cloth stacked flower crafts and paper-cutting art.
The director of the Yanan City Civil Brigade, Madang Poe, introduced the demonstration, which carefully selected the outstanding red-written product of the Yanan for almost two years, of which 16 were excellent works of the 2019 national red-written product.
At the same time, they invited the National Intangible Cultural Heritage Conservation Project "Anse Slice Paper", "Shangbei Folk Songs" and the provincial non-remain project Yonchuan Bu stack passers, to focus on the Yen An Folk Feature products, and to take this opportunity to communicate with enterprises in other exhibition areas to promote cross-regional cooperation.
In Japan, the cumulative number of confirmed cases exceeds 30,000 - Xinhua Network
According to statistics, 239 new confirmed cases were recorded in Tokyo on 26 February, and over 200 new cases were recorded on a single day of six consecutive days, reaching a cumulative total of 11114.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka County and 80 new cases in Aichi County.
70% increase in fraud offences in telecommunications networks in the first half of the year
On July 26, China News Online reported that in the first half of this year, the national prosecution service prosecuted 58101 people for fraud offences, an increase of 35 per cent over the previous year.
In particular, fraud offences are more prevalent in offences that disrupt epidemic prevention, and prosecution services account for 43.4 per cent of all persons who disrupt outbreak prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has conducted targeted guidance, and a total of nine cases involving fraud have been published in 10 typical cases of outbreak prevention and control.
In the first half of the year, the prosecution ' s handling of cases involving fraud offences was characterized by a multiplicity of names, ranging from national macro-policies to the consumption of food and clothing by the population, including in areas such as outbreak fraud, "medical to medical" fraud, "health care" fraud, "incorporation" fraud, "loop" fraud, State subsidy fraud, unfreezing of national assets, etc., and the constant "exploration of new ones", ranging from education, medical care, employment, old-age, social security, expropriation, accurate poverty alleviation, financial credit and so on, which not only caused economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affected economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break national borders, geographical and human constraints, have characteristics such as crowd, cross-border, remote, e-payment, have a large number of non-specific groups of victims and are highly harmful.
Some, for example, set up specialized companies, rent high-end writing buildings, create multiple departments or posts, use legal web platforms for advocacy, recruitment, training and appraisal of recruiters, use business operating models for management, wear "legal coats", and become more confusing.
It is the responsibility of the prosecution service to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to provide timely warning to the public and to the authorities concerned.
In the administration of justice, the prosecution has carried out its duties with due diligence, maintaining a high level of pressure on fraud offences, and tailored law enforcement initiatives to promote social governance through, inter alia, the issuance of prosecutorial recommendations.
. The prosecution has made the arrest of the person, the prosecution of the fraud case de facto, the evidence, the procedure and the application of the law, based on the facts, subject to the law, and in vain.
In particular, for the crime of telecommunication network fraud, emphasis is placed on the central role of electronic data in the determination of facts, and efforts are being made to construct a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.
As in the case of a fraud committed by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Ningbo County, Zhejiang Province, the Public Prosecutor's Office intervened early in the first time, from the time the case occurred to the end, for only five days, reflecting a fast-tracked attitude and determination to maintain stability in society.
In reviewing the arrest and prosecution chain, focus on the prosecution of the leaks in the case, correct the omission of 733 persons by the public security organs, and correct the omission of the public security organs to examine the prosecution of 1113 persons by the co-accused.
In the first half of the year, the national prosecution service issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations on fraud offences, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud offences and promoting deep governance.
For example, in response to loopholes in the regulation of the telecommunications network found by communications companies, banks, intermediaries, etc., the Guangzhou Public Prosecutor's Office of Guangdong Province, and the Dong Jing Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office issued timely inspection recommendations urging the units concerned to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms and help build a long-lasting system.
The fourth is to do everything in its power to recover the damage.
The prosecution authorities in all parts of the country have seized important links such as intervening in the investigation to guide the evidence, examining the prosecution, and urging the investigating authorities to actively pursue the stolen money, cooperate with the authorities in the recovery of the stolen funds and work to minimize the economic losses caused to the population by fraud offences.
As in the case of a certain set of road loans, handled by the Beijing City Public Prosecutor's Office, the case involves the arrest of 22 housing units on a waiting basis, the initial issuance of a "suspension letter" in cases where the property may be disposed of in advance of other cases, the timely delivery to the relevant court, and the recommendation that the previous seizure court suspend execution of the property in question, pending the investigation of the crime, and make the best effort to recover the property in question and recover the victim's damage.
The prosecutor reminded you to be very vigilant about the fraud offence, not to look to "the sky drops pie" and not to trust and keep your "money bag" for cheap.
Weining County, Guizhou: Short apple trees, wide out of the poverty road - the new net.

. . . . . . . . . . . in Weining County, where the town is located, due to low latitudes, high elevations, ample light, high day and night temperatures, high sugar content and good taste of the produced apples, with some visibility in the surrounding area, but also due to small heads and high spots, it has not been possible to sell a good price and has failed to form the size of the industry.

In the critical period when the fight against poverty continues into the final battle, changing traditional planting practices, restructuring industries and increasing farmers' incomes are imminent.

To that end, the town of Luna introduced the Dragonhead Enterprise to grow apples in a modern way.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in 2015 from Shaan . from Shaan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuan Zhong to turn the land out and plant apple trees, and the Li Yuan Zhong couple made a grunt in their hearts: "For so many years have grown apples, and I have not seen who grew apples in the village makes money. "
"All the apples that are grown are dwarfed apples that don't allow apple trees to grow too high."
What Li won't expect is that this apple planting has adopted a new method, that irrigation pipes are laid under every apple tree, that water and fertilizer are watered together to the roots, and that when the fruit is collected in the autumn, the tractor drives directly into the orchard and can pick the fruit standing.
At present, Apple Base has gradually entered a productive phase, and the market, as envisaged by Huo Jianwen, does not sell apples, which are very popular with urban consumers such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and others.
The growing apple industry has made a new change in Lee's life and, although still growing, income has a new source.
The Lee Yuan Zhong family had more than nine acres of land flow transferred to Apple Base, with a profit split after the suspension, in addition to a bailed-down land flow fee, and the couple usually worked in the base, "one man gets $80 a day and there's work to do."
. . . . . . Lee Yuan Zhong told reporters that last year the profits were split over 2,800, and that, together with land flow fees and the income of the couple's workers, the family's income was more than 80,000. "It's been a long time since Xiao Kang's days had passed."
"Accordingly, one acre of apples have an annual value of over $15,000, about 10 times the size of a corn crop. "
. Chen told reporters that the town had now planted 20,000 acres of apples, 6,000 acres in the village of Nakhai alone, covering 4056 households, 172,000 people, including 656 poor households, 2952 people, paid more than $6 million a year, and actually achieved the establishment of a base doorway to work without going outside.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This year, at the Spring of the Year, Lee won a cross-country car, such as a car driving to and from work today, "There are more than a dozen acres of land in the house, and more revenue when the apple base expands next, and all flows to them."

Map of new hybrid matrix membrane preparation techniques
This newspaper Reporter Swe reported that today, the Tianjin University Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team made significant progress in developing a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology to significantly enhance the carbon dioxide capture performance of the membrane material.
The results have been published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, and CO2 emissions are the perpetrators of the "greenhouse effect".
How efficiently to capture and utilize human emissions of carbon dioxide is the focus of scientists' attention.
The "film separation method" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technique that separates carbon dioxide gases with the help of membrane materials and features energy efficiency and operation simplicity.
How to make membrane material "deeply breathe" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is a bottleneck in capturing carbon dioxide using membrane separation.
Innovative thinking by the Tianjin University scientific team explores, through repeated experiments, the effects of different solvents on the separation performance of membrane gases.
The results of the experiment show that using N-methylacetone as a solvent for preparation, the carbon nanoplumage distribution is more evenly distributed in the produced membrane material, "more gas permeable", which effectively improves the efficiency and rate of separation of the membrane material gas.
. A mixed matrix membrane prepared with this new technology, CO2 separation performance is close to the theoretical separation cap of such membrane material as it currently is.
"New technologies provide new ideas for membrane separation methods to capture carbon dioxide. "
" We hope that this technology will provide strong support to future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises in the handling of flue gases and play a major role in areas such as control of greenhouse gas emissions. "
Before you volunteer to fill in, you can figure out what's a bad professional--the new network.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning Herald by Yu Xiao duty editor:
You know what a professional is before you volunteer to fill in.
Every year you fill in a higher examination volunteer, there are students or parents who are not aware of the terms involved in the volunteer report, which in turn affects the volunteer filing.
This year, Beijing Transport University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing Post and Telecommunications University, Beijing Forestry University, and five universities of Beijing Chemical University jointly issued a 2020 admission policy to eliminate professional differentials.
What is the meaning of poor professional grades and what is the significance in voluntary filing?
There are three ways the rules of professional assignment.
. . . . . . expert reminds that before filling out a volunteer, it is important to read the Charter of Admission at the Heart School in detail, and to understand the admission rules for higher education institutions, including the transfer ratio, professional distribution rules, etc.
The rules for professional assignment refer to three ways in which professional admissions are primarily given professional priority, grade priority, and professional grade difference, after a higher education placement.
c) Which way the college specifically uses will be specified in the Statute of Admissions.
There are, however, some higher education institutions where the principle of admission is the overall priority and there is no grade difference between professions.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The so-called "Professional Poorness" is the degree in which the institution, when arranging for a candidate's specialty, determines the selection of candidates for a different professional voluntary examination according to one or more of the points published in the admissions charter, which is the "Professional Poorness".
That is, the difference between the scores of the college's admissions to the first professional voluntary and non-first professional voluntary, and the difference between the different professional volunteer grades, such as three points, two points, and one point.
For example.
Assuming the students' primary school examination for A higher education, 560 points were taken, and their professional volunteers were: computers, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, A higher education with a poor professional admission method, with a difference of 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, and 0 points.
In the professional distribution, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets professional admission requirements and has a planned professional balance, Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" profession; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be reduced by two points, ranking with the first professional volunteer's "International Trade" examination, and determining whether the professional admission conditions are met; if the score is still not met, then the third professional volunteer "automated" admission will be reduced by one (i.e. 556); if the score is still not met, the follow-on profession will no longer be reduced by one (i.e. 556).
Different professional levels in different universities
With the spread of parallel volunteering, many higher education institutions have now eliminated professional grade differentials, but some of them have retained this method this year, with more than 20 universities setting up professional grade differentials this year, as measured by the publication of the "Academic Charters" by the respective schools.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Medicine, Jiangsu University of Technology, Jiangxi Teacher Training University, Chengdu Medical School, Northeast Power University, Jimi University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Industrial University, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, and China Civil Aviation Flight College.
In these higher education institutions, each university has a different level of specialization.
Some colleges have grades in each specialty, such as the University of Ningxia, where the files have been placed and accepted in order of points, depending on the order in which the examineer fills in professional volunteering.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. For example, at the Université des ensembles, the total difference in professional volunteering is 4 points, i.e. 3 points for first professional volunteering and other professional volunteers, no grade difference between other professional volunteers, considered parallel volunteers, and 1 point difference between other professional volunteering and transfer professional volunteering.
When filling out a volunteer, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is a difference in professional grades, what the form of the difference is, and, while taking due account of the score, a reasonable analysis of the schools and professions to be selected, if the institution explicitly uses a differential grade in the admission charter, and when selecting a profession, the candidates should be careful about the gradients between the professions and increase the number of admissions.

The large-scale integrating media operation "Leading Village Live to See Out of Poverty" is an important initiative of the Central Radio and Television General Financial and Programme Center to make a strong campaign against poverty in line with this major theme.
The operation will go into more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions, cities and municipalities across the country, excavate the story of the living out of poverty, directly address the dramatic transformation of the village and show how villagers break the path to survival and development.
This operation will last for more than three months.
From Xuzhou, the reporter split between the two routes and traveled all the way to the southwest, via Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet; the other way to the northwest, via Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, and more than 10,000 kilometres.
In the form of the report, the "walking village live to see out of poverty" boldly integrates.
The economic development of the villages visited by caravans will be broadcast through the Central Radio and Television General, the Financial and Economic Channel, the Voice of the Economy, China Transport Radio, and the New Media for Financial and Economic Affairs.
Among them, live television will be completed primarily on the OEM channel's midday news programme, "The World's Money" (first broadcast: Monday to Wednesday at 12:00-13:00), and the OEM channel's prime news section, "Economic Information Combination", will have an anti-poverty news column (first broadcast: 20:30-21:30 on Monday to Sunday).
At the same time, the caravan will provide a live one-hour broadcast to every village visited at the OMA client, where viewers will be able to watch the live broadcast and participate in the draw event by downloading OMAPP.
