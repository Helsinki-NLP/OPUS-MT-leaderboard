Since the withdrawal of United States President Trump from the nuclear agreement in May last year and the imposition of sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the nuclear agreement reached with the major Powers in 2015.
The agreement states that Iran can only refine uranium with the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges.
The other signatories of the agreement, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to save the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.

The women's platoon is expected to defend the World Cup ahead of schedule!
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in the match against the Dutch women's row, the Chinese team was pulled back to a city by their opponents in two games in a row, culminating in nine runs by 3:1 . . . . . . . . . .
The World Cup's schedule is nearing its end, and while the defending is on the lookout, the Chinese women's line-up is still impervious in the face of the Serbian team.
In the first two games with the Netherlands, the Chinese women's row was as strong as ever, going down two cities at 25:19, 25:16, until the third.
The Dutch women's row increased the aggressiveness of the ball, and the Chinese team was hit, and the girls attacked their hearts, and mistakes began to increase and were eventually pulled back to a town by their opponents at 21:25.
In an interview, Rhohei also stated, " The third round, because of the error we sent about eight points. "
Of course, the Dutch women's line-up was not supposed to be small, and the Chinese women's line-up was prepared to be difficult, although one game was lost, but everything was still in Rongping's hands. " It was normal to play with the strong and win, and five games were normal, so we said to focus on the team members, " Rongping said so.
In the fourth round, the team actively adjusted the situation, Zhang Zhang Zhang Ning opened up all the fire at the end of the attack and received eight points in the single game to make a big difference to the team's victory.
So far, the 11 rounds of confrontation have only two rounds left, and the Chinese women's row, although one hand has touched the championship trophy, did ring the alarm for the Chinese women's row in the match against the Dutch: the more critical it is, the more hard it is.
In another match on the 27th, the Russian and American women's rows were full of five games, and the United States team failed to take all three points from their opponents, so that the Chinese women's rows could be crowned in a round ahead of schedule as long as they took all three points against Serbia.
All these developments are moving towards conditions favourable to Chinese women's rowing.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the current form of the scoring, the Serbian team has been largely unlucky, which means that they can "solden up" in the match against the Chinese women ' s line, drop their bags and hit their opponents with their full force, while the Chinese team is under the pressure of winning, and their state may rise and fall.
In addition, the replacement Serbian team was not the Lamb of the "Employed Slaughter" after a battle with the Dutch, in which the two sides fought in five games, and the Serbian II eventually reversed the Dutch overall main lineup at 3:2, thus demonstrating the depth of its strength.
Before the third stage of the competition, Rangping also said that the Ho, Sze and the two teams would be very hard to deal with: " The Osaka match will be very difficult, and we will still have to prepare carefully, as we have always done. "
Now the defending horn has blown, and the game has really reached the "White Heat" stage.
In terms of strength, the Chinese women's rows are all above their opponents, only at the last critical juncture, and to see whether the women's row girls can play their normal level and release themselves as much as possible on the field.

However, if the hero walks around, it also looks like you're just like me.
Yuan Yongping, a deep-heart rice research, produces a good breed, leaving billions of people in the world free from the fear of starvation and feat, and this is usually like an old farmer who likes to be in the fields; Nan Indong, a leading scientist who has made China's Sky Eyes angry, a man who spends his whole life, a pot, doing only one thing in his life, eating cold buns in the deep mountains of Guizhou, and an old Han in his castle; Zhou You Chang, a red scientist, a late village boy who still looks like a Zhiko, a school-stuttering white hair, says that he's learning to the heart, likes to laugh; Qin, a red half-side film artist, after ninety years of age, and wants to be in the highlands for six or seven hours a day, and to be in the name of an unnamed maid.

Once upon a time, a girl high school student was mad at the web, " When a hero passes by, someone always sits and applauds... and I don't want to be a hero, and I want to be the one who sits and applauds. "
In fact, when a hero applauds a hero, it's not contradictory.
The people who applaud the roadside, are also transmitting heat and light, and themselves are luminosity.
. . . . . . . . as you are me, there is always some chance in life, some moment, a day and a moon, and it is also shaping the image of a hero.
In Shanghai, the best judge, Zou Beihua, shoulder to shoulder with the task of judicial reform, lets the delivery room teacher Fu speak his own story at the annual conference, receiving and sending numerous newspaper letters a year from no error, " do the simple thing, it's not simple " , and Zou Beihua leads the judges to give applause to this old "sweeping monk"-like mail and dispatch.
It's a relationship between heroes, a hero applauding another hero.
There are Shaolin temples, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experiment field, Nan Indong has "the sky's eyes", Qin Yi has a stage, and Zhou You Chang has a platform ... can be a hero, not only by working on his own, but also by having a good environment and a positive incentive mechanism.
For example, "China's Sky Eye", which now appears to be a myth.
In the 1990s, Chinese science and technology were still struggling to climb the slopes, and the novelist Liu Tse-hyun has yet to write "Three Bodies".
The greatest "eye" at that time was a single-calibre radio telescope in the Valley of Puerto Rico, United States – Arecibo, 350 metres in diameter, considered to be the world's most inescapable.
The Chinese radio telescope at that time was less than one tenth in diameter.
And Nan Indong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home, bringing back an almost insane idea: building a new generation of radio "big telescopes" in China, receiving more messages from outer space!
China's a waste of money to play with stars?
The Fatherland trusted Nan Indong, and "The Sky Eye" was the epic opening of the project.
It took 12 years for the site to be selected and another 9 years for the project to come to fruition.
The 500 m caliber of "the sky's eyes" opened, and China did it without precedent, "the world's unique great scientific engineering."
So, "The Sky Eye" is great, the South Indongs are great, there's a lot of room, there's a lot of high-profile republics.
With the trust of the State, the goodwill of the national, the South Indoons have the chance to become the liver of the spirited people of the country.
A country with young talent, white-haired heroes, and people applauding gently on the side of the road, a country that is beautiful and harmonious.

In 2019, on the basis of the piloting of the compulsory classification of waste from life in Changchun City, the province decided to undertake the classification of waste from living in local cities.
The city of Gillin is one of them.
Through this event, we hope to achieve the effects of child-led families, kindergartens-led societies, and the promotion of environmental concepts.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On the same day, the gardener read an environmental initiative, hoping that the waste classification would start with the child.
The children, after performing the "low-carbon bee" dance, grouped up to do a small game of garbage classification.
The mentor also issued the "Recoverable " "Other Garbage" label, advising the children to stick the label to the trash can and record a small video when they come home.
. Liu Li-chun introduced that the kindergarten had been promoting low-carbon, green-environment concepts and regularly opened environmental lecture halls.
. The trash dump in the garden also set up a sorted trash can, with the drop categories indicated.
The teacher taught the kids what they could do with recyclable garbage.
According to preliminary statistics, approximately 5.4652 million tons of municipal waste were generated in 2018 in Jilin Province, all of which were admitted to the disposal site.
of which, 3.29.29 million tons of sanitary landfills were burned and 2,09.23 million tons were burned, using the process to treat 801 million tons in an integrated manner.
. After many years of effort, the province's municipalities and counties have the capacity to dispose of the waste of life.
In the "Girling Province Work Programme for the Advancement of Land-level Urban Living Waste Classification", which has been released, there is a clear requirement to further the classification of waste into school, educational materials, classes, etc., and to enhance interaction between students and parents through creation of garbage classification songs, songs, comics, microvideos, etc., to achieve the effect of "Educate a child, affect a family, drive a community and prepare a new generation".

The "CX-4" came on the market in 2016 and has fallen in the effect of new cars for a long time to date.
The reduction in prices as a result of a strategy to increase brand value in a long-term perspective is also known to have a significant impact on sales.
The sales of Maurada in the United States increased by 7% over the same period, reaching 27482 units, 14 months later.
In August, the sellers had one more day of business than in the previous year, plus " enhanced promotional activities such as publicity " (Mavda), which had led to an increase in sales from SUV "CX-5" etc.

Herake's dead, political legacy long lived.
On 26 local time, French former President Chirac died at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is in the middle of a century without major changes, the many political legacy left by this French politician when he came to power still deserves our praise.

In the midst of European integration, the growing prevalence of unilateralism in the United States, and in the wake of the past, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices in international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly very revealing.

In 2004, China established a comprehensive strategic partnership, with China-French bilateral engagement entering a completely new phase.
During the Chirac administration, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and cooperation between the two countries in a number of areas, including aviation, nuclear energy and rail transport, made groundbreaking progress.
The Middle-French Cultural Year of the Chirac Initiative created a completely new pattern of cultural exchange in the history of Middle-French.

But I'm confident in China myself.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, and that its experience is sufficient to help it build ideas and values for harmonious development and to shoulder its responsibilities for a long time on the world stage. "
I also believe that the revival of China will bring new creative dynamism to world culture and enrich world culture.

The Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR co-sponsored an anti-U.S.-related bill.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Legislative Council was formed in a joint statement on 27 February, expressing strong opposition to the passing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 by the Foreign Committee of the Senate of the United States Congress.
This statement, co-sponsored by 40 formed members of parliament, states that Hong Kong's rights are currently vested in the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including the preservation of the status of free trade ports and separate customs zones, the conclusion and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements in different fields such as the economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, and sports, in the name of "Hong Kong, China", in trade, cooperation and development relations with different countries and regions of the world.
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature.
In the past, Hong Kong has strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, conducted commerce with different countries and regions, and engaged in cooperation in numerous related fields, with remarkable and visible results.
The statement stated that the move of the United States Senate Committee to pass the relevant bill was not necessary, but merely as a means of violently interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs and seeking political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong, in response to the call of its bad port agents.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The statement states that Hong Kong is an important trading partner and the largest source of trade surplus in the United States.
The excellent rule of law in Hong Kong, a fair and free business environment and a clean society have made it a good site for American businessmen to conduct business.
If the United States were to pass the bill, it would make relations between China and the United States worse, in addition to attacking Hong Kong and the United States itself, without any benefit and to the detriment of others.
The statement states that Hong Kong will, as always, apply the "one country, two systems" approach, continue to enjoy the rights granted by the Basic Law and effectively fulfil its obligations.
Both in the past, now and in the future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international commerce.
According to the European Times on 26th, the reform of immigration policy will be discussed next week in both houses of the French Parliament.
The President of France, Marquelon, has recently claimed in this regard that France is not in a position to " receive everyone " , but at the same time to try " to take it properly " .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In recent days, in an interview during the general debate of the General Assembly in New York, United States, Markron expressed the hope that there would be a real "two-pronged" programme on immigration policy to find a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
According to Marlon, " if France wishes to be able to accept (immigrants) properly, it cannot accept all " .
Quoted in four priorities of immigration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; promoting the integration of migrants more efficiently; receiving and protecting all immigrants entering French territory; and more efficiently resettling those who have entered France illegally and are not fit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Aid (AME) system is the most discussed topic in previous circles.

The leftist Socialist MP Valao believes that France should "receive more and better" on the issue of immigration, and criticizes Marlon on the topic of "mucking".
The report states that a year has passed since the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act, which has led to disagreements within the ruling party, but at the same time has not been able to pacify the right-wing opposition.
In the next general election in 2022, the migration policy topic will again become the focus of a far-right attack, and Markron needs to make a difference on this issue, but at the same time will also risk irritating the left-wing people within the ruling party.
It is reported that the lower house of the French National Assembly will debate immigration policy from 30 September, and the Senate from 2 October.
There are indications that Chinese A shares are on the "repurchase wave" and that many listed companies are coming out of "real silver and silver" to buy back company stocks.
According to financial data service provider Oriental Fortune, as of 27, the total value of A stock listed company buyback implementation in 2019 was over 100 billion yuan (RMB, down the same line), well above the figures for the same period in previous years, creating a record high in the amount of A stock buyback funds.
In response, Xuyang, chairman of Shanghai's MacKorung Information Advisory LLC, said that this year's lower overall valuation of the A stock market, the buy-back of shares at relatively lower prices, would benefit listed companies in improving the efficiency of the use of funds, as well as reflect the willingness of listed companies to proactively manage market value and the abundance of cash flows, and would help boost investor confidence.
In addition, the continuously improved stock buy-back system has also pushed listed companies to actively engage in stock buy-backs.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued rules for the implementation of repurchase shares of listed companies, providing detailed stock buy-back norms and guidelines for listed companies.
In addition, media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented a buy-back scheme have focused mainly on infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronic equipment manufacturing.
In addition, in terms of the amount of repurchase payments, six listed companies repurchased more than $1 billion this year.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What would be the market impact of repurchases of shares by listed companies?
Zhao Zingjun, Vice President of the Faculty of Finance and Finance of the People's University of China, said in an interview with a reporter from China News Agency, that the buy-back, on the one hand, showed that listed companies had a stronger economic power and a better financial position, were capable of maintaining stock prices stability and giving investors confidence; and, on the other hand, showed that listed companies and their holding shareholders were responsible to the company, to the market and to investors.
The former is based on the good business performance of the company, while the latter requires that listed companies and their holding shareholders be of a higher quality.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . for capital markets
The return of shares by listed companies helps boost investor confidence and supports the stock prices of listed companies.
The Eastern Securities Research also measured that, based on the expected stock buy-back volume set by A stock listing companies as a whole since the beginning of this year, and the average price of the traded stock that has been repurchased, the incremental funds that repurchased stock for the A stock market this year are expected to exceed $150 billion.

Zai Changqui, the curator of the former Tianjin Folk Museum (Queen's Palace), was drawn from 1991 to 1994 with the approval of the relevant State authorities.
The fresco is known to have been painted south of the palace, on the walls of the North Palace, 32 metres long, 2.6 metres high, in two parts, with more than 30 stories from the Queen's Day, crossing the sea, and pluming the sky, and 358 individuals recreated the life of Mother's father.

In order to protect, rescue and rescue the ancient paintings of Mother's ancestral events, the Ancient Cultural Street Management Committee and the Queen's Palace of Tianjin City initiated the restoration of the palace and interior frescoes.
The restoration project was led by Cai Changqui, who invited four prominent national painters to participate together.
The restoration work was based on the principle of ‘repair as old as old', while the original frescos were adapted to local content and additional repairs were made to areas where the frescos were not originally perfect.
In repair, we also made innovations and attempts in colors, materials, pen inks, etc.

The Queen's Palace was built in 1326 and was formerly known as the Palace of the Princess, commonly known as the Queen's Palace, after many remodelings, it was one of the oldest buildings in Tianjin City and one of the earliest temples of mothers and fathers in the existing years of China.
On 25 September, the shipping ceremony at Beijing's Da Xing International Airport was solemnized.
The Peking Da Xing International Airport terminal's styling "phoenix wings" was dubbed the head of the Seven Miracles of the New World.
At present, Beijing Capital International Airport is overloaded, carrying 100 million+ passengers last year, making it the second year in the world after the United States airport in Atlanta, where passengers are overloading hundreds of millions of times.
By 2022, passengers at Beijing's Da Xing International Airport are expected to have had 45 million throughputs and 20 per cent international flights; by 2025, passengers will have had 72 million throughputs and the share of international flights is expected to reach 30 per cent.
How cool is it, as a "new door"?
The Beijing Da Xing International Airport, located between the Dai Xing District of Beijing City and the Guangyang District of Hebei Province, is 46 km from Tiananmen's straight line, the largest new airport in the world today.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Beijing Dai Hing International Airport is the world's first terminal with two arrival and two departure floors – the F1-F4 being international arrivals, domestic arrivals, domestic departures and international departures.
The two-story bridge that connects the high-speed to the airport outside the terminal corresponds to the terminal F3, F4 – the international departure to the floor and the domestic departure to the two floors is possible.
The Beijing Da Xing International Airport's first voyage opened the Beijing "Two Airport" era.
The new airport is located as a large international air hub, and the country has developed a new source of power to support the construction of the Kyosin-Yui regional integrated transport hub in Yuan Xinjiang. To date, 66 airlines are interested in entering the Beijing-based Da Xing International Airport, of which 20 are in-country airlines, 46 are in Hong Kong, Australia, and foreign airlines, and flights of various airlines have been granted on an ongoing basis.
In the 2019 winter spring season, Beijing's Dashing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, of which 101 are domestic and 15 are international; it covers 112 global destinations, including 97 domestic and 15 international.
This has resulted in coordinated development with Beijing Capital International Airport, with moderate competition and an internationally first-class competitive "double hub" airport pattern, which both eases the pressure on capital airport capacity to saturate and better meets the urgent need for rapid air transport growth in Beijing and surrounding areas and effectively enhances the international competitiveness of our civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing's Da Xing International Airport takes full account of geographical location, the relationship between the airport and the surrounding airspace and operating environment, the airport runway being used for the first time in the country as a "full-way" layout, the world's largest air pipeline automation system, and the establishment of China's largest terminal control area, which maximizes the efficiency of aviation operations.
For the first time, airports of this size in the country have used the Nationalized System for the Automatic Processing of Luggage and Information Management, using innovative baggage transfer modes to increase the efficiency of baggage system processing.
The Beijing Da Xing International Airport premiered, heralding the Phoenix Show Wings showdown.
The creation of more than 40 international, domestic, and, first, a new airport with a nationalization rate of over 98 per cent will have a direct and indirect economic impact on the industry in the surrounding area and will breathe life into the economic development of Beijing.
Maverick's provisional November convention is scheduled to be transferred to the age of 16.
. Mahua is tentatively scheduled to convene a central congress in early November, with a proposed amendment to the age of transfer to the party under the charter until the age of 16.
As Congress passed the lower voting age for the general election, Mahua announced that the 66th Central Congress, to be held this year, would propose changes to the party charter, including a downward revision of Mahua's entry age from the current 18 to 16.

He said that since the Election Commission would only meet on 1 October to finalize the nomination date and polling day for the by-election in the Danvuby-Ai seat, they would meet the following day, 2 October, to discuss whether to change the date of this year's central congress.
He also explained that the purpose of yesterday's meeting of the Central Committee (26th) was to finalize the dates of the congress and to amend the party charters, and that it was just a coincidence that the indigenous Unity Party, the Danyubiai Congressman, had died of an unfortunate illness and had joined the agenda for this seat by-election.
Wang Bok-xiang, Secretary-General of the former Su-wang County of Shandong – Red Sonshin-Sinhua Network, the rich people of Qiang County
Qiang Wang, Shandong Lifelight, born in February 1943, participated in the work in 1967 and served successively as County Party Secretary, County Secretary, Mayor, etc.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in 1986 Wang . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In his five years of service as a succour, Wang, with his heart of the people, focused on three things: first, advancing vegetable industry; secondly, developing succulent saline beach; and thirdly, laying the groundwork for industrial flipping, allowing the succulent to raise pockets and lift the waistboard.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the early 1980s, lifeless farmers could not sell their harvests, rotting in the ground.
. Wang's research found that the key to catching vegetables is to make a good circulation.

Party cadres have to take the lead, screwed up, and everything's going to be lost in the county.
In 1989, 17 members of the party, including Wang Loi of the village of San Yuan Zhu, with the support of Wang Zhang, set up 17 winter-style vegetable sheds, and in that year the village emerged with 17 "double million households".
The county then established a promotion team, which, with the mobilization of Wang Birchian, guided Wang Loi to various townships; in its first year, more than 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted, followed by vegetable shacks such as the one that took place throughout the county and even throughout the country.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million acres of land, other than saline beaches, have been painted on shallow beaches.
The local masses live very hard.
Su-nam's got a vegetable shed. What about Su-bei?
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Wang Bok-xiang and the county's leadership lived on the site, pushing cars to carry burdens, eating and sleeping, and the people saw them all stretching their thumbs and beating their hearts and eyes... at the time, Shoubei had developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed "poaching basins" on salted beaches.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in July 1986
In the course of the conference, a "Comparison of Industrial Economic Figures in the 12 Districts of the City of Xiacho" was released, at first glance with a good lifelight and fourth place.
But if the original salt is removed, the pure industrial value of the lifelight is only $119 million, in third place in the penultimate place.
. . . . . . . with more than 70 takers, Wang ran out of town to " change his mind."
. . . . . . . . . less than a year back, the county invested $150 million and went on 77 projects.
Every year since then, they have organized " take-through groups " to Shenzhen, Dong-jung and Shanghai.

In 1991, Sumiang entered the ranks of the top 100 counties in the country, and Wang was transferred to the position of Vice-Mayor of the city of Xiujiao.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, and 4854 businesses, over 100,000 "millionaires", a cadre recognized by the people who still call him "Our Brahma Secretary."
On 26 September local time, Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, presided over the Foreign Ministers of China and the African States Members of the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The current African Council member, Côte d ' Ivoire, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Côte d ' Ivoire, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Equatorial Guinea, Oyono, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa, Pandor, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Niger, the incoming member, Carla, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia, Jehinawi, attended the meeting.
He made four proposals to strengthen cooperation between the Central African parties in the Council.
First, to unite our strength.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, with the immediate consequence that the basic norms of international relations are challenged and the role of the United Nations is affected to the detriment of a large number of developing countries, including African countries, and small and medium-sized countries.
In order to meet this challenge, it will be necessary for Central Africa to hold hands, side by side, to unite in order to have the strength.
In the Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, and the focus is not just three votes, but the continent as a whole.
If China and Africa stand together, it is not just four votes, but it will lead other countries to follow, influence and shape the Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council to make full use of this coordination mechanism.
The second is the resolution of disputes through consultation.
China has always advocated a political solution to hotspot issues, and Africa has a good tradition of consultation and experience of successful good offices from African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex challenges on the Council's agenda, particularly the African hotspots, are mostly the root cause of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We want to work together on Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and on the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation, etc.
The third, self-empowerment by self-reliance.
African countries and peoples know best about Africa's problems, and Africa has the capacity and the wisdom to solve its problems.
The Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa when dealing with hot spots in Africa, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to enhance its coordination with non-aligned parties and to resolutely advance capacity-building for African-owned peace operations.
Fourth, development is what makes it essential.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we will insist on putting economic and social development first and mutually supporting each other's chosen development path.
China would like to align the "across the way " with the AU Agenda 2063, the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030, and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries build their capacity for development and address the root causes of conflict.
Together, we want to push the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa's development.
The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has re-emerged, and China has done and will continue to do its utmost to provide human and material assistance within its capabilities, and is willing to coordinate its efforts with African countries to mobilize the United Nations, WHO and others to scale up their assistance and play a good role in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Newborns, etc. relays save small lives.
Surprise!
The second-born mother had an early onset, and on the way to the hospital in panic, a 32-week premature baby could not wait to be born on Dad's car co-pilot.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On 19, 20, 21, the Maternity and Neonatal Section of Hubei Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital received three premature births on the road for three consecutive days, and the other two were born in 120 first aid vehicles, all 29 weeks of premature births.
Ms. Cheng was a second-born pregnant mother, and at 7 a.m. on 19 September, she felt a little tummy pain, thinking that she was 32 weeks pregnant and that the first was also premature, and she packed up the items for delivery and was ready to take a shower and go straight to the hospital.
At 9:30, Ms. Cheng packed up and asked her husband to drive from Xudong's home to the hospital.
I didn't expect the baby to be born on Dad's car co-pilot soon after the car opened up.
20 minutes later, Ms. Cheng and the baby finally arrived at the maternity and obstetrics building of the Hubei Department of Maternal and Child Health.
The hospital security officer, who saw the husband and wife and the baby who were in panic, immediately informed the maternity ward that four doctors and midwives, such as Zhang Jianqian, had a handbag and an umbilical plate, and rushed downstairs.
" At the time, the mother was half lying on a car co-drive with sheep and blood under her, and a baby boy was right next to her, and was attached to the umbilical cord. "
Zhang Chai asked to learn that the baby was a 32-week premature child, that parents on the way didn't have the time to cover the package for the child, that the morning of the first fall was already cold, that he was freezing his skin pale, no crying, and that the limbs were swollen.

The head of obstetrics at the provincial maternal and child health care centre, Sun Guoqiang, introduced that in recent years, women and children in the province have received many babies born on the subway, in private cars, a situation that may threaten the life of the mother and son.
Mr. Sun reminded that pregnant mothers should come to the hospital as soon as they have abdominal pain, broken water, and seen red.
In case of pelvising at home or on the road, the mother should be as flat as possible, with blankets on her hip, etc., to prevent the baby from coming out of the back of his head to hit the ground, and the child should be warmed as soon as possible and sent to a doctor as soon as possible.
New Air Technology is officially open.
The establishment of VSTEA was one of the detailed elements of the memorandum of cooperation signed by VAECO and ST Engineering Aerospace in April 2018, marking the emergence of Viet Nam's first aircraft equipment maintenance and repair consortium.
• Two first-class aviation technology companies from Viet Nam and Singapore work together to provide aircraft equipment maintenance and repair services to domestic and foreign airlines.

The White Paper shows that manufacturing has become a focus of attention for major countries around the globe.
This is what journalists learned at the "Forum on the Operation and Protection of Intellectual Property Rights at the 2019 World Manufacturing Congress" organized by Fats.
The Forum focused on the contribution of intellectual property rights to manufacturing upgrading in China, from a macro-level of policy interpretation and a micro-level perspective of business practice, a comprehensive exploration of innovative initiatives for the operation and protection of intellectual property rights in manufacturing, an in-depth examination of the hotspot topic of intellectual property protection in manufacturing, a continuous upgrading of the high-quality application of intellectual property rights, and the acceleration of the build-up of manufacturing smart upgrading advantages.
The Forum invited experts from the National Intellectual Property Authority, Chinese Academy of Sciences scholars and relevant national and international industry organizations and professional research institutions to contribute their ideas on how to strengthen intellectual property protection and promote the sharing of experiences in the application of intellectual property rights.
At the Forum, the Anhui Department's Market Supervision Authority released the report "A qualitative assessment of innovation development in the patent navigation Anhui Province", which ranked Amhui Province eighth in the 31 provincial municipalities and fourth in the country on the innovation factor aggregation index, based on results measured by the Regional Innovation Quality Development Index for Patent Navigation, the 2018 Regional Innovation Quality Development Index for Patent Navigation.
The Forum was hosted by the People's Government of Anhui Province and co-hosted by the Market Supervision Authority of Anhui Province, the National Intellectual Property Operating Public Service Platform and the China Intellectual Property Development Union.

To date, more than 800 industrial enterprises of more than size have been collected with information on the need for intelligent adaptation.
Zhang Hong, Deputy Director of the Department of Economics and Information Technology of Wuhan City, has since launched an action plan for the intellectual transformation of industrial enterprises to provide free counselling and diagnostic services and offer solutions for industrial enterprises of more than the size of the need, with a view to advancing a new round of high-level technological transformations of enterprises across the board.
According to the plan, Wuhan City publicly selects a number of specialized diagnostic services each year to conduct an intelligent adaptation needs survey for all industrial enterprises of all sizes and above in the city, through the creation of columns, questionnaires, and door-to-door filings.
To date, more than 800 regulatory industrial enterprises have been collected, accounting for almost one third of the total number of industrial enterprises above the city's scale.
The five city-level diagnostic platforms have organized teams to be part of the enterprise to conduct a "one-on-one" on-site assessment and programme justification.
Zhang Hong, the city is currently organizing 373 intelligent transformation projects, with a total planned investment of $29,760 million, the first 5G intelligent production line in Rainbow Letter Communications China, the national lead smartphone production line in Motorola, the Wuhan Siemens transformer digitally unmanned plant, the national first batch of quantitative satellite production lines, the return to life world leading the new veterinary drug intelligent production line, and the subsequent start-up of a group of leading smart workshops and intelligent factories in industries such as the Eubon Networked Smart Production Line.
In addition, the city of Wuhan has increased its financial support for smart transformation projects.
Among them, investments were actually completed by industrial enterprises with intelligent modifications; they included investments in equipment hardware, soft investments in R & D, with 8 per cent and up to $20 million in transformation grants.
At the same time, financial institutions such as the active joint exchange, the Zhe Chamber of Commerce and Wuhan branch, provide personalized financial services specifically for the intellectual adaptation of industrial enterprises and significantly ease the pressure on businesses to finance.
Trudo's "people collapse," can he be re-elected?
This time tripping Trudeau out of a "big pit" that Trudeau himself dug up a little bit.
In recent days, the Canadian media has been exposed to several old photographs of the current Prime Minister Trudo, in which Trudo disguises himself as a black person.
This is considered to be a clear act of racial discrimination, with the spin causing a wave of violence in Canada.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Canadians, however, don't buy much.
Trudo kind of took up a rock and smashed his foot.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Simply put, this time tripping Trudeau out of a "big pit" that Trudeau himself dug up a little bit.

At the time, Trudeau presented many deaf platforms, ideas such as "ethnicity and gender equality " , " eco-environmental protection " , "economic revitalization " , and stressed the eradication of corruption and "improperness".
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Taking the issue of "ethnicity and gender equality" aside from this "black-faced" incident, he had previously "speeched to nothing" on a series of issues relating to the natives, causing the indigenous groups, leaders, to move protest tents to the gates of the Capitol Hill during the 150th anniversary of Canada's statehood.
In terms of combating corruption, at the beginning of last year, Trudeau was involved in a boiling "Lanvening incident".
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Moreover, Trudeau, instead of being angry with the officials who disclosed the misdeeds – the previously mentioned Wang Chongdi – was the first to disclose the ills and was the Attorney General of Canada when the case was dealt with directly.
Although the case itself is questionable, its suspicion is difficult to wash.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to Canada's most authoritative Angus-Red poll data, since 2015, supporters of Trudeau have slipped from over 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent, while opponents have jumped from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Even though the other opposition parties and their party leaders are equally poor, even a significant number of voters who still wish to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now disconcerting with the federal Prime Minister, the head of the ruling party.
On 21 October, when the new Canadian federal legislative elections are about to begin, will Trudo be able to repeat the play that won a big win five years ago?
The answer may be just one word: hard.
both at the level of enterprise competition, at the level of consumer experience, and at the level of regional aviation integration, Kyonjin aspires to develop the dimension of integration, which has far-reaching implications and positive implications.
On September 25, Beijing's Da Xing International Airport was officially navigated.
The reporter for the New Kyoto newspaper was informed by the Beijing City Reform Commission that the capital airport was in oversaturated and that the opening of Da Xing International Airport would enhance the capital air service capacity.
Following Shanghai, Beijing became the second city to have two airports in our co-city, serving mainly domestic aviation services at Shanghai's Rainbow Bridge International Airport, and Pudong Airport, which is dominated by international shipping, will also locate future capital airports and Da Xing Airport to serve the differences between domestic and international air operations and provide more subdivided services.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The capital airport, which had 100 million passenger throughputs in 2018, was the country's highest, but still had a significant low capacity compared to the rapidly growing business demand, particularly with a large gap in international route demand.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passenger tourism, travel, etc., and to adapt to the increasing opening up of Beijing, the trend towards cities with international connectivity, Da Xing International Airport is located as a large international hub airport, with plans to meet 100 million passenger throughputs per year and 4 million tons of cargo mail throughput in the future.
So, there is no overlap between the two airports, which are targeted at different customer groups, and there is sufficient market space.
On the economic account level, it is clear that the navigation of Da Xing International Airport will have a win-win effect, ease Beijing air power tension, accelerate the growth of passenger and cargo throughput, and build an incremental cake for the capital aviation bi-nuclear operation.
From the user's point of view, as Da Xing International Airport travels, it is not necessary to concentrate all future trips on capital airports, but can also reduce the range of problems associated with excessive concentration of routes, such as longer pass-through security, slower passenger boarding, an indirect increase in the time spent by aircraft and passengers at airports, an increase in the burden of running airports, a decline in shipping through capital airports, and, indeed, an improvement in the travel experience of passengers.
According to media estimates of the time and cost of multiple transport routes to large international airports, such as the departure from the South Five Rings to take the high speed of Kyoto directly to the high speed of Da Xing Airport, 50 minutes will be available to drive, the oil money will be around $40 and the high speed fee will be $15; and the track transport subway Da Xing Airport line will be selected at a distance of 20 km and 30 km, with a fare of $10,25 and $35,3; citizens will also be able to travel between Beijing West Station and Da Xing Airport Station for just over 20 minutes.
All in all, there are multiple means of transportation available for citizens to travel to Da Xing Airport, and costs and time are within a reasonable range.
. From the point of view of trend: Da Xing Airport is located at Kyo Jin-yi Transport Hub, so it is a little further away from the city of Beijing, but it reinforces radiation exposure to Hebei, Tianjin, and facilitates travel of more people, which is significant for the economic development of Rushing Hebei, Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei, Tianjin passengers have access to additional international air route services provided by Da Xing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning of Da Xing Airport.
Accompanying traffic facilities at Da Xing Airport are very well developed, with several highways connecting Da Xing Airport to the surrounding area, in addition to the new airport line in downtown Beijing to Da Xing Airport.
This is just like the city passengers in Guangdong, Fushan, Qingyuan, who can go to White Cloud Airport in Guangzhou via the Guangfu, Guangzhou Highway, and the residents of Beijing's surrounding porches, Yuan Xin District, etc. will also benefit from Da Xing Airport and receive easy and efficient air services.
As can be seen from this, the navigation of Da Xing International Airport, which includes not only several runways and a few aircraft, either at the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or regional aviation integration, and the development of integration, has far-reaching implications and positive implications, not only for the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, but also for the diversification of the movement of the vast number of residents, as well as for the further improvement of the quality of services in the Beijing shipping industry, which is more conducive to the promotion of the process of integrated development of Kyong Ying and to the economic and trade development of the areas surrounding the Da Xing airport.
Therefore, for the navigation of Da Xing Airport, we do not only account for the individual's affairs in the economy, but also for the overall development.

2019 Forum on Economic and Social Issues in Viet Nam in the Province of Chengxi
The Deputy Director of the Economic Committee of the Vietnamese Congress, Nguyen Dejian, revealed that early this year, the economic and social development of Viet Nam showed many new developments and continued growth.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development in late 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, the participants had an in-depth exchange of views and views on four themes, including the economic development situation in 2019 and the impact of some of the FTAs, some of the prominent issues in the 2019 Vietnamese economy, prominent issues in the 2019 Vietnamese culture and projections and proposals for the economic and social development of Viet Nam in 2020.
There was general agreement that global economic growth slowed in the first months of 2019, with increased risks and challenges.
The trade friction between the major economies has further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that, despite the uncertainty surrounding the global economy, where 70 per cent of the global economy ' s economies were at a standstill in growth, Viet Nam ' s economic development continued to achieve many welcome achievements, macroeconomic stability, inflation was effectively controlled, and the residential consumer price index grew by an average of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019, the lowest growth in nearly three years.
In the first half of 2019, GDP grew by 6.76 per cent, although it was 7.05 per cent lower than in the same period last year, but the increase was still high compared to the same level in the 2011-2017 period.
In predicting trends in the economic development of Viet Nam from 2019 to 2020, Dundeeing, Deputy Director of the National Center for Economic and Social Projections of Viet Nam, said that against the backdrop of the turmoil in the world economy, the economy of Viet Nam in 2019 had shown a high growth momentum.
By 2020, Viet Nam ' s macroeconomics are expected to remain largely stable, and the implementation of FTAs will contribute to trade development, economic restructuring, and business environment improvements are further enhanced, and Viet Nam ' s external export activities will show a decline as a result of trade friction.
There is therefore a need to strengthen the early warning mechanism for monitoring forecasts, proactively seek trade relief measures for Viet Nam's exports, find opportunities to expand new export markets and create facilities for external exports of various commodities, such as agro-water products.
At the same time, the control of inflation at a reasonable level promotes the development of supporting industries and supports the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture, among others.
The Director of the Chinese Embassy in Siem Reap, Liu Zhijie, held a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
According to Liu Zhijie, 70 years after its founding, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributing more Chinese wisdom and Chinese programmes to improve global economic governance and promote global co-development, making an important contribution to world peace and development and bringing tangible benefits to Cambodia ' s economic development and the well-being of its people.
As the second largest economy in the world, Liu Zhijie described China's contribution to world economic growth as more than 30 per cent, especially the China "One Way Down" initiative, where cooperation between local Chinese provinces and cities and the provinces of Siem Reap and the region continued to deepen.
He said that this year was the opening year for the 61 years of Chinese-Cambodian friendship, with fraternal friendship between the two countries, and that China-Cambodia mutually beneficial cooperation would be a driving force for local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siem Reap, Disaiha, highly commends the great achievements of the new China over the past 70 years and congratulates the two countries on the results of their friendly cooperation.

According to Disakha, the friendly relations of Siam Province with the Chinese provinces and cities are notable. To date, friendly city relations have been concluded with 28 provinces and cities of China, large cultural show projects, Wu Go Smile and the Wu Go Dynasty, Siam-Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Garden, Siam International Airport Project, special training course for Siam International Airport officials, Siam particle scholarship to China for study abroad, rural diagnostics, the Xinghuang adaptation of urban roads, and the White Industrial Restoration Public Interest Project, Light Line, have been fruitful and fruitful, and the Siam people have been the direct beneficiaries in friendly cooperation with Cambodia.
The reception was attended by the Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Ken Wensson, President of the Siamese Provincial Council, Governor of the 5 provinces of the prefecture, the Siamese Branch of the Cambodian Council of Ministers, volunteer teachers, representatives of the Siamese Branch of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia, representatives of Chinese-owned enterprises and representatives of the foreign Siamese-based leaders.
In the town of Yunming, we've witnessed a decade of cloud rises in digital China.
If the 2009 local website forum were used as a starting point, the 2019 Cloud Habitat Conference in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 had been going on for a full decade.
From the concept of a cloud fog to the practice of "top cloud", big data, cloud computing became one of the core technologies underpinning China's economic development, social management, and public services in 10 years.
At the Shintai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Heining, Zhejiang, a number of new "leagues" loaded with Aliyun artificial intelligence were recently attached to the mass examiner.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to the head of the company, the "mass inspector" with the camera has focused on learning over 40,000 defective samples, which, with the cloud computing power behind it, allows for the rapid conversion of infrared images into binary languages and will place flawed battery pieces in classification.
This business is just a microcosm of today's cloud computing-aided manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a Guide to Promoting the Implementation of Clouds in Enterprises (2018-2020), proposing that by 2020, efforts should be made to achieve a significant increase in cloud awareness and motivation in enterprises, and a significant increase in cloud scale and application depth.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the same time, our cloud computing industry has grown in size over the past 10 years.
The White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (2019), published by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July of this year, shows that the total market size of Chinese cloud computing in 2018 was $962.8 billion, an increase of 39.2 per cent over 2017.
In addition to being the key technology that underpins industrial transformation, digital economic development, invisible "clouds" change urban management and social life unwittingly.
This year at the Cloud Habitat Conference, the "city brain" featured for three consecutive years remains a source of concern.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Through cameras, artificial intelligence algorithms, the city's brain, through its powerful computational ability, allows new urban management service functions such as "stop first and pay " , " real-time perception of the number of visitors " , "Tourism route design" to be achieved.
In the area of government services, the alignment of "one cloud" with "one thing" brings together "the palm office" to advance in concert, and cloud computing brings convenience to both ends of the supply of government services.
At present, Zhejiang has built a province-wide unified public data platform through the government over Yun.
As of September 11, this platform has covered over 57 million resident residents and over 15 million corporate entities in the province, and is grouped into 3066 categories of 19.08 billion pieces of data.

Makoto used a plastic tea bag to make tea!
In recent days, according to the Central Society, a recent study in Canada found that a package of plastic tea bags could release billions, or even billions, of plastic particles, significantly higher than a person's estimated total intake of microplastics, but there is no evidence to date that the intake of plastic particles could pose a threat to humans.
It is reported that researchers at Maggill University in Canada found that immersing plastic tea in an almost boiled hot water (95°C) would release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles to the cup.
This number is significantly higher than a person's total estimated intake of microplastics.
According to research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
It is known that this study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea packages from the Montreal store and café, opened the tea pack, immersed the tea bag after cleaning it into almost boiling water for five minutes, and analyzed it with electronic microscopes and spectrometers.
According to this study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, " several orders of magnitude higher than the plastic load of previous foods " .
. Reports say that most tea bags are made of natural fibre, but many brands that use natural fibre to make tea packs still use plastic to seal them.
Some branded tea bags are no longer paper-made and instead use plastics, which are the subject of testing by researchers.
The plastic particles are small fragments of plastic, and researchers define these microplastic sizes between 100 nm and 5 cm, which are produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic waste.
The researchers found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches around the world, running water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
The researchers first found plastic particles in human faeces samples from several countries in different regions of the globe in October 2018.
In order to test the potential toxicity of tea packs of plastic particles, this Canadian research team places daphnia in contaminated water and finds that microplastics affect the behaviour of these daphnias and cause them to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that the ingestion of plastic particles could pose a threat to humans.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . researchers speculate that these tea packs release a large amount of plastic particles, which may be the reason for these plastic tea bags to be in contact with boiling water, even when "eating grade" plastic is heated to above 40 degrees Celsius, they may break down or seepage toxic substances.

While small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
As these countries are in middle-income status, many are also caught in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and the time has come to make major decisions and to invest heavily in small island developing States ... "
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transition to renewable energy; and urging international agencies to help small island developing States, particularly highly indebted middle-income countries, to access finance.
The small island developing States are at the forefront of the protection and conservation of the Earth's lifeline, the ocean.
The latest special report issued this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered "throwing" severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of the century, many areas may have experienced some extreme sea level rises that would have occurred only once in a century each year.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable if substantial funding is not invested in adaptation.
The pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.
The world has lost half of all living corals in the last 150 years, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the last 40 years.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a reduction in resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small island States also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, which expose them to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security implications of illegal trafficking in human beings, arms and drugs.
. . . . . . . . . . . by addressing a problem in the most challenging environment, Gutierrez said that it could be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the "Sustainable Development Agenda 2030" will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples to be drawn from around the world. "
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case of sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India stated that the financial system was sufficiently liquid.
The Minister of Finance of India, Sitaraman 26, said that the current financial system was sufficiently liquid and that, driven by the demand for holiday consumption, India ' s economic growth was expected to recover in the second half of the fiscal year.

Abe's third video to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
At 26 local time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated the People's Republic of China on the 70th anniversary of its founding by video.
Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan: Good evening, everyone. I'm Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend my warm congratulations on behalf of the Government and people of Japan.
At the G20 Osaka summit in June, Japan and China collaborated to make the summit a success and declared to the world the firm will of the G20 through the " Osaka summit declaration of G20 leaders " .
In addition, at the Japan-China summit talks and dinner prior to the summit, it was agreed that President Xi Jinping would undertake a State visit to Japan next spring, while unanimously determined to open a new era in the day.
The two countries of Japan share a major responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
It is my firm belief that working together to address the issues facing the region and the world and together to contribute to the international community will be beneficial in shaping a new model of future relations between the two countries.
In conclusion, I wish the day for relations to flourish and for the cause of my friends to flourish.
. . . . . . . . . . over-age farmer workers on some sites are estimated to account for more than half.
Where are we going to find young workers now?
There's no way to use so many 'old people ' on the site. "
In recent days, Zou Qui, who has been working as an engineering contractor in the construction industry for a long time, has lamented the presence of a number of over-age peasant workers (over retirement age) on the site.
In recent times, the university where the penr is based has been working on rain-contaminated diversion projects, and there are a lot of peasant workers on the campus, and if you watch carefully, you will find that there are a lot of over-age peasant workers in this.
It is not "leaved" that over-age peasant workers go out to work, but rather because they "cannot" have the "must be so" impotence and hardship – whether to raise money to solve their own pension and medical problems or to help their children, they drive these old people who should have been "leaved" to work hard.
The "old age" of over-age peasant workers is not as easy as we thought.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . in order not to drag on children, but also to build up some wealth for themselves, a number of peasant workers insist on " drying until they can't do it " .
The reluctance of many "90s" and even "00s" new generations of peasant workers to engage in hardship, labour-intensive secondary industries or low-end services has created structural "working waste", which are unattractive jobs that provide opportunities for over-age peasant workers.
In the absence of a skill, physical and labour capacity has declined, and many over-age farmers are engaged in high-intensity, low-income, high-risk, and low-security jobs.
A day is a day, a little more earning, and the survival plight of the over-age peasant workers behind "not to be idle" cannot be ignored and ignored.
The solution to the problem of unpaid and wage-raising, sound labour protection, reduced safety risks, increased labour income and improved survival of over-age migrant workers, in addition to their "self-recovering " , is equally dependent on the public sector ' s system of welfare and human care.
. . . . . . . . . it has been noted by scholars that overage farmers are no longer likely to rely on home farming to solve their own problems of old-age and medical care, and that they have to feed their families by other means.
The impotence and strength of reading over-age peasant workers "cannot be idle" helps us to better understand the love and pain of over-age peasant workers.
Seeing the backs of over-age migrant workers, hearing their sigh and finding ways to make them back in the country truly " old and independent " , requiring shared responsibility among the public sector, the market and society in virtuous interactions, and a combination of efforts.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This approach is fully in line with international practice.
The major producers of weapons and military equipment are always the first to ensure their own defence needs before they deal with export orders.
earlier, General Yuri Grehoff, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force, said that the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by the "Frontstone-Antee" air defense Conctern.
This is a new generation of anti-aircraft systems that have adopted the working principles used to destroy ballistics and aerodynamics objectives.
The main role of S-500 is to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles, capable of intercepting missiles with a range of less than 3,500 km.
In addition, according to some information, S-500 can also destroy high ultrasound cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of drones, high ultrasound missiles that exceed five times the speed of the sound, even targets located in near-space.
Such weapons can also become a unified network with other anti-aircraft systems, especially S-400 systems, which is very important from a defence perspective.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He said the system was currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian army also needed it, including in the Arctic region.
The S-400 anti-aircraft system entered the Arctic Air Defense Corps.
According to information from 15 September, the work of the New Island Arctic Air Defense Corps to modify the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic region.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely a process within the plan for the transition to a more advanced defence tool in the strategic direction of the north.
According to the Russian Northern Fleet Information Service, " with the transition to a new S-400 air defence system, there has been a marked increase in the controlable airspace of the Arctic region " .
It is very important that, according to the military assessment, the system has been used successfully in the far north and Arctic regions.
The Air Defense Corps troops trained the new system and prepared for combat duty.
It was previously equipped with a S-300 long-range air defence system and still has a portion of it.
As far as anti-aircraft systems are concerned, they must have weapons capable of destroying a variety of aerial targets, be they targets of high-speed flights at an outer altitude or "flagfish" close to protected facilities.
According to open sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by "Gold Diamond-Antaire" Air Defence Conccerne, was designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high ultrasound targets and other air attack weapons.
This weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 km and shoot down ballistic targets flying 4.8 km per second within a distance of 60 km.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional anti-aircraft forces in the far north to ensure the security of airspace on the Northern Sea Road.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of "Tor" - M2DT" anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic region, which were sufficient to form an air defence camp to strengthen air defence systems in the Arctic region.
The Russian Ministry of Defence said at that time that the Arctic "Toll" forces would be expanded to complete brigade-level formations in the future.
Together with the new S-400 long-range systems deployed on New Island and the Kola Peninsula and the "Pantsir" - SA" short-range systems deployed in the far north, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are a powerful defence of Russia's polar skies.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government's idea, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods and avoid the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
The Russian company, which is a Russian store operator, focuses on selling Russian goods in China.

The Russian export centre will work with Russia to develop marketing strategies and participation criteria for stores and to screen virtual shelves for product businesses.
The store plans to open before the end of this year and mount products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
Information from Russian export centres indicates that the total number of visits to Chinese electrician platforms is as high as 1 billion per month.
At the same time, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014 and have exceeded $1 billion in 2018.
At present, the Ali Baba Group will also open pilot stores to sell commodities from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the Global Import Strategy.
. According to Alexei Kojevnikov, the new store will display goods for businesses with at least 500 million roubles in sales.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and the sales of 500 million roubles are not yet adequate.
We all know that Chinese consumers ' attitude towards Russian goods is quite positive and view our goods as high-quality and green-green products ... "
According to Kozevnikov, competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is intense and increasing.
He said, " Our goal is ambitious, with 500 businesses launched through this store within three years. "
At the same time, the platform will also mount products from Russian enterprises in the Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of the Trade Policy Fundamentals of the Economic University of Plehanov, Russia, said, " This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, as Russian export centres are State-owned rather than private institutions. "
"I have not seen a large number of highly competitive Russian goods on the market. "
He believed that the project would probably not really be implemented, but would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
The Russian export centre president, Andrey Slepnev, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that the product information of more than 170 Russian enterprises had been released on the largest international wholesale line platform, Alibaba.com, and could be purchased in China or in other countries.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with the Aribaba Group, an expert training project for Russian enterprises from the University of Treasures, whose first seminar was held in July of this year.
The Russian export centre at the second China International Import Fair in Shanghai in November of this year will also be the organizer of Russian enterprises' participation in industry exhibitions and commercial projects.
A major exhibition will be held at the 1,000-meter exhibition hall, which will also be the centre for commercial project activities, protocol signing ceremonies, promotion sessions and talks with Chinese business representatives.
Currently, about 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Centre said, " In addition to the agricultural pavilion, we must also hold business meetings, which are direct links between entrepreneurs. "
" This is another direction of our efforts to support businesses and to ensure that dozens of specialized meetings are arranged for them ... "
In addition, the fair will host master classes, cooking contests and Russian-named food fairs for cooking on the project "Exploration of sea stations above Russian foods".
Following a decision on Friday by the Coroner's Office of Mohamad Adi, a martyr, who died of a non-incidental death, the police took the next steps after waiting for a full report and awaiting instructions from the General Prosecutor's Office.
the National Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation issued a statement on Friday that, according to the coroner's ruling, the police would await the most further instructions from the General Prosecutor's Office.

The U.S. electronic smoke has claimed 12 lives and the associated lung damage has reached 805 cases.
According to Central, on 26 local time, U.S. health officials said that 12 people had died from electronic smoke-related diseases throughout the United States, compared with 805 cases of lung damage associated with electronic smoking.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that these figures had been reported and indicated that no specific substances leading to the disease had been identified.
The majority of patients, however, report that electronic smoke products containing tetrahydrocannabinol have been used, which is the main compound in cannabis that can affect mental state.
It is known that the surge in lung cases is associated with the purchase of contaminated electronic smogizers on the black market.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention noted that the 12 deaths mentioned above occurred in 10 states, from California to Florida, and that the 805 related confirmed and suspected cases were reported by 46 states and the United States Virgin Islands.
In the past three weeks, India and Massachusetts in the United States have banned e-smoking sales, while New York and Michigan have banned the use of e-smoking.

When's the next bus coming?
The Internet+Intelligence Station gives you a count.
On 27th, Nanjing Wisdom Transportation United Gold Map announced to the public that the country's first Internet+Intelligent Stations would officially land in Nanjing, when 54 bus electronic screens would be lit, which would completely upgrade Nanjing's informatics services, increase the efficiency of bus service and increase the happiness of the population to travel.
In the past, the anxiety scene of waiting for the car was played almost daily at the bus station.
It is difficult to predict the running time of the bus, and it is difficult to learn about the traffic along the route and the location of the vehicle, that the problem of the public handing over of the pain points is a matter of urgency, especially in some major cities, with long commuter routes and complex traffic conditions at the peak hours of early and late commuters, which has made it difficult to secure the speed of the bus points.
For this reason, Nanjing Smart Transportation worked with Gaudd's map to explore the new directions of Internet + Transportation People's Service and launched the country's first smart service project, Internet + Smart Station.
It is known that the country's first Internet+Intelligent Stations landed in Nanjing, incorporating Gaudd's big data and Gaudd's vehicle's projected travel time ETA algorithm, and building on public transport electronic station signs and mobile Internet, traffic big data upgrades, realizing the ability of the "public smart station+electronic map" to release bus routes on both ends, and public transport expected to reach station time.
Through the Internet+Intelligent Station, Nanjing citizens not only have easy access to scheduled bus arrival times, know the real-time location of the bus and a few more stations away from the current site, but also have the ability to grasp the traffic along the road in three colours, red and orange, so that the real-time status of the bus line through the station can be seen.

Xinhua's time review: Stay firm and stay on our own path.
The White Paper "China and the World of a New Era" released on 27 September answered: China's development has been successful for 70 years, essentially because, under the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the right path to China's distinctive socialism and have steadfastly followed it.
It is the choice of history, the choice of the people, that China takes the path of development that is appropriate to itself.
In recent times, in an environment of poverty and weakness and internal distress, a generation of ingenious Zionists have sought help on the path to the rescue of the people of the country, moving on to their successors.
However, " the constitutional monarchy, the revival of the empire, the parliamentary system, the multiparty system, the presidential system have all been thought of, tried, and the results have not worked " .
It was not until the Communist Party of China, and with the new China, that the Chinese people gradually opened up a Chinese-specific socialist path in practice.
The path that China has taken is one of happiness for the Chinese people, one of revival for the Chinese nation, and one of common development for China and the rest of the world.
It is on the right path that China will be able to do its business well and become the second largest economy in the world, the country that contributes the most to global economic growth, and that it will continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As noted in the White Paper, this path of development in China, which is in line with China's national context and adapted to the demands of the times, will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people value it more.
The Chinese understand the logic of the Southern Orange North, and understand that what suits others does not necessarily suit themselves, and that only what suits them is best.
It is with such road confidence and strategic certainty that China has created a remarkable miracle.
In the traversing process of human forwards, the "historical end conclusions" were once famous.
Today, the success of China's distinctive socialist path proclaimed the end of the Historic Final Conclusion, the collapse of China's collapse theory, and the failure of Socialism's failure.
China's success has boosted the confidence of the developing countries to achieve national prosperity, expanded the path to modernization in the developing countries, and provided experience and lessons learned for the countries and peoples of the world who wish to accelerate development while remaining independent, and to follow a path that is appropriate to their national circumstances.
The world is rich and colorful.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose a path of development that is appropriate to their own circumstances.
Rather than "input" the foreign model or "output" the Chinese model, China will firmly move its own path, achieve its own evolving development, strengthen its governance and exchange with countries, and make its due contribution to the common achievement of good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a Foodworks supermarket owner fired a 66-year-old woman worker via text message because he was more willing to hire employees from Asian backgrounds, and the boss 's practices were heavily criticized as " shameful " .
The committee said that Ms. Gail Ayton ' s boss, Jianbin Wang, English name Eddie, had been working at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, treated employees in a " highly unfair " manner and could violate anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the store in 2016 and that he had been "wanting to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In this case, Peter Sams, Vice-Chairman of the Committee, conducted a search on the Internet and found that "Mr. Wang has in the past posted some job advertisements at various Australian Chinese employment forums " .
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one says "Preliminary Asian woman", and the other says "Present Asian employee".
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by text message in April of this year, later stating that it was due to her absence from work and the small amount of cash allegedly missing from the cash register from $5.10 to $30.
Mr. Sams said that Mr. Wang's reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She's been absent for only one shift in three years, and the "missing amount" totals a few Australian dollars.
He said that Ms. Ayton's dismissal was "not actually related to her actions or performance."
He said, " It seems to me that the real motive behind the dismissal of Mr. Wang, supported by the evidence of the job advertisements he had released, is that he was more willing to hire staff with an Asian background.
According to section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang ' s actions appear to constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of applicants are illegal. "
Mr. Sams said that, given Mr. Wang's "horrifying" treatment of Ms. Ayton, it would be inappropriate for him to consider reinstating her position.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, who was a temporary worker with an hourly salary of A$26.
In view of the possible violation of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams stated that he would submit his decisions and documents to the Committee to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be referred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal laws.
He said that Mr. Wang had not given Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for firing her.
He said, " I think that the defense should have taken an irresistible unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, Mr. Wang "waiting" the opportunity, and he believes that this would `prove' that the termination of the applicant ' s employment was justified ... "
"He was wrong ... that the defence should have completely ignored any natural and just treatment given to the applicant when dismissing her, and that he was appallingly rude and extremely unjust in his perfunctory."
Mr. Sams said that, although Foodworks was a small business, " it must be said frankly that no decent employer would dismiss an employee in an extremely unfair and perfunctory manner, as recognized in the present case ... "
He said, " This is shameful and extremely unfair. "

He stressed that he was not afraid of any threat in himself, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to denigrate the Action Party and the Helk government or other Greek Union leaders, so that the decision was taken only after careful consideration.

The TV show Fox Hunting fielded, and there's a line of detective police.
The transnational collection of investigative subjects, Fox Hunting, was recently fielded at Tianjin Airport, and actors such as Wang Kai and Wang Guo filmed important scenes such as escorting economic suspects to return home, a process supported by China Southern Airlines.
The Fox Hunter group this time filmed the key play that best demonstrated the results of Operation Foxhunt law enforcement – the Foxhunt team members sought the fugitives back, took the plane, signed the arrest warrant, etc.
The group took scenes of multiple sets of footage, such as tarmacs, customs border checks and cabins, hatches, and recreated a Chinese line of dry police and fox-hunting heroes flying across the country to track down the hard-won journey and professional styles of fugitive criminals.
In order to successfully complete the shoot, the Foxhunter lead team made a great deal of pre-production, repeatedly confirming each implementation detail and ensuring that the most real and straightest visual effects were presented.
It is known that the show will also be viewed and filmed abroad on a number of occasions.
Vietnam needs to catch opportunities for artificial intelligence development.
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities at the level of preparation for the AI wave include prospects, realization capacity, asset base and direction of development.
The city of Singapore ranked first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
In response to an interview with the reporter by Oliver Wyman, an expert from the organization said: " I find it very meaningful to look back and assess cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.
On the whole, I think the future of Vietnam is bright in the context of high growth, strong economic development paths and rapid growth of the talent base.
I think Vietnam is on the right track, and it's doing well.
It is important that Viet Nam know how to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to promote more economic development ... "

About 800 million people have traveled to resurface the demand and supply of tourism in China.
About 800 million trips will take place in the coming 11th Gold Week!
The large data from several tourism platforms show two booms in supply and demand in our tourism consumption market.
The travel report predicts that there will be close to 800 million visitors in the country during the national holiday this year, taking into account statistics on tourism from previous years; in addition, there will be more than 7.5 million out-of-country trips.
At present, tourists from more than 500 cities are booking cruises, travelling freely, custom tourism, local play and other products through the platform, involving 100 countries and territories.
The Chinese Institute of Tourism calculated that there were 726 million visitors to the country on the National Day holiday last year, an increase of 9.43 per cent over the same year.
This year ' s national holiday will not only be more innovative in terms of the number of visitors, but an upgrade in consumption will also be the "master melody" of the national holiday trip.
It was reported that the national holiday holiday spent more than $3,000 on cross-provincial tourists in the country, an increase over the same period last year, as visitors generally chose better-experienced products, such as high-rated brand hotels, no shopping tours, elite groups, specialty cars, etc.
The donkey mom's travel net booking data show a similar trend, with comfort cars being used throughout the country's long line, and "league regiments" under ten are more popular than in previous years.
The Spring and Autumn tourism data show that its consumers prefer experience, service, and differential "slow from tolerance " .
The fly-hog data show that the fastest growth in the number of bookings for city visitors on the four lines and below is 30% over the same year, reflecting an increase in consumption in more areas of the country.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The accompanying data show that the country's holiday rental self-driving order is expected to increase by nearly 60% over the same year, and that short-distance self-drives on small lines around the Secret Service continue to be popular; the number of private companies enrolled increased by as much as 155% over the same period.
The sharing of joy becomes the main purpose of people's tourism and leisure.
The accompanying data show that 28 per cent of the visitors on the National Day holiday were kinsmen, 25 per cent were couples traveling, and 23 per cent were friends of colleagues traveling together.
In addition, from the age of visitors, "after 80" and "after 90" account for more than 50% of the total number of visitors.
It is a matter of concern that this year, in contrast to the more rapid growth of the Golden Week outbounds, the domestic tour market is more "hot-eyed."
The Flying Pigs data show that the number of people booking their domestic Wen Brigade routes for this year's national holiday has increased by 42% over the same time, and the rate of increase exceeds the rate of emigration.
The industry analyses, while demand is high, the tourism supply side reforms are being promoted across the country to provide visitors with a much richer "Blood Brigade Festival " .
For example, the National Directorate of Sports, Ministry of Culture and Tourism, has recently jointly released the " Eleven Gold Week Sports Tourism Quality Lines 2019 " ; The Shanghai Tourism Festival 2019 is being held to launch seven plates with 100 cultural and tourism events to attract tourists from China and the outside; and several provinces near Golden Week, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong, have introduced scenic ticket drops or free measures.
The accompanying booking data show that the destination with a unique natural wind or cultural feature in the country is the "fire" and that Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Sian, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin will be the most popular domestic tourist destination city.

China is expected to become Australia's largest export market for beef.
An animal protein analyst from the Dutch Cooperative Bank (Rabobank) said that China faced a severe shortage of pork following the outbreak of the African swine plague and was expected to become Australia's largest export market for beef.
Following the outbreak, Chinese consumers were shifting from eating pork to other animal proteins, which had led the authorities to destroy many herds, and in the past year the number of raw Chinese pigs had been reduced by half and the price of pork had almost doubled.
China produces and consumes two thirds of the world's pork.
The Senior Animal Protein Analyst Pan of the China region of the Dutch Co-operative Bank (Chenjun Pan, acoustic translation) said that demand for other meats, including beef, had increased, that China, the world ' s largest animal protein importer, currently imported 27 per cent of the world ' s pork, and that beef imports accounted for 24 per cent of the world ' s imports.
Ms. Pan said that Chinese imports of beef from Australia had increased by 65 per cent in the first half of the year, and China had surpassed the United States and Japan to become Australia's largest export market for beef.
Yesterday, the Chinese government stated that more pork would be released from the emergency reserve before celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party of China.

The companies listed on the market bought back over $100 billion a year-old Xinhua Network.
In order to stabilize the company's stock price and preserve its image, the listed company began buying back its shares frequently in the last two years, hoping to transmit this message to the market through targeted buy-backs, pooling bid transactions, and thus stabilize stock prices and enhance investor confidence.
The Eastern Wealth Choice data show that the funds used by listed companies to buy back shares in 2017 were $7.9 billion, which jumped to $51 billion in 2018, and that since 2019, the total value of repurchase implementation by listed companies in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in the East, and in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in currencies in shares in shares in shares in currencies in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in shares in currencies in shares in shares in shares in shares in currencies in currencies in the Eastern currencies in currencies in the Eastern currencies in currencies in currencies in currencies in currencies in the Eastern currencies in currencies in the Eastern currencies in currencies in currencies in currencies in currencies in currencies in the Eastern the Eastern currencies in currencies in currencies in the Eastern currencies in the value to the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value
The company repurchases shares for the same purpose as larger shareholders, but there are significant differences in the subjects of implementation, sources of funding, purposes of repurchases, and equity itself.
In an interview with the Securities Daily News reporter, the chairman of Shanghai's MacKorung Information Advisory LLC said that, in November 2018, the Opinions on Supporting Repurchases of Shares by Listed Companies, which had been introduced, had been repaired in response to problems with the current system, such as the narrower scope of stock buy-backs, the complexity of decision-making procedures, and inadequate inventory systems, which had previously encouraged listed companies to repurchase shares, had increased significantly that year.
In January of this year, the Exchange Office, Deep Exchange, officially issued the Rules for the Application of Shares Repurchased by Listed Companies, the introduction of which broadened the sources of funding for repurchases by listed companies, properly simplified implementation procedures, led to improved governance arrangements, and encouraged various listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee holding schemes.
After the opinion was issued, the listed company conducted the stock buy-back operation, with more application, simpler buy-back processes and greater equity buy-back motivation.
Repurchase of shares in relatively low positions also helps listed companies to increase the efficiency of use of funds, thereby increasing the level of profit per share, increasing the rate of return on net assets and reducing pressure on corporate profitability indicators.

In Xuyang's view, underestimation of stock prices is a major factor in the buy-back of listed companies, whose stock prices no longer reflect the future development prospects of companies, so such companies deserve investors' attention, but cannot be blindly invested, and attention needs to be paid to the financial reports of such listed companies, as well as to the circumstances in which they operate.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The enthusiasm for repurchases by A-listed companies has gradually increased, and has also regularized the repurchase behaviour, with data showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented stock buys back this year, and that the leading companies in the various industries have become the main force in the repurchase market.
In China, China has recently revealed the progress of repurchases in safety, stating that the company has cumulatively bought back 5.75 million shares of A shares, or 0.315 per cent of the company ' s total equity, and that the total amount paid is $5 billion (excluding transaction costs), and that the repurchase shares will be used entirely for the employee holding plan, including but not limited to the long-term service plan that has been considered for adoption by the corporate shareholder conference.

The TCL Group issued a repurchase progress announcement on 25 September, indicating that the TCL Group had accumulated a $359 per cent buyback of the company's shares, at a total cost of $1.65 billion.
The TCL Group Board Office said to the Securities Journal reporter that the buyback shares would be used for employee holding plans, equity incentives or for converting company bonds issued by listed companies into stock.
The TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy and continuously improves competitiveness and sustains healthy development.
• Based on confidence in the company's future development and the preservation of investors' interests, combined with the performance of the company's stock in the second tier of the market over the past year, and taking into account the company's business performance and financial situation, the company plans to buy back the company's shares using its own funds, self-financing and other forms of financing.
The former Chief Economist of the Ocean Open Source Fund, Yang Delong, said that the operation of repurchases of shares by listed companies could, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares in circulation in the market and increase each share of the earnings of listed companies, which would be an important benefit for the stock prices of the secondary market; moreover, the willingness of listed companies to proactively pull out real silver and silver and buy back stock cancellations from the stock market greatly boosted market confidence.
The buy-back of domestic listed companies has been gradually increasing in recent years, especially the merit stock, and it is a very good way to boost investors' confidence through stock buy-backs, and it is also a positive and encouraging practice.
The Hunan Provincial Council, Changsha City Council Secretary Hu Jinhua and Engineering Machinery make the Four Masters – Jan Junxing, Liang firm root, Ho Chinghua, Liu Fei-hyang, set a "small goal" around "Yongsha from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing" – creating a world-leading industrial cluster of engineering machinery three or five years later.
The construction of the world ' s leading industrial cluster of engineering and machinery in Changsha, in modern terms, is the construction of "the strongest surface."
As an inland provincial capital city, Changsha calls out this rhetoric, and what is the bottom line?
It's the power of the hegemonic side leak.
The four engineering machinery companies that participated in the dialogue, one by one, covered the sky, the ground, the sea, the land area: the mountain river-smart light aircraft, the concrete delivery pump of the Middle Heavy Unit, the full ground crane of the trio, the tunnel shield of the iron construction heavy, and its "hard power" could be a one-stop world, pomping on the males.
Once upon a time, China had little right to speak in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
In time, Chinese businesses "introduced" a two-wheel drive, carrying the East Wind, acquisition, merger, plant-building and so on, making a leap into the global engineering and machinery industry.
Among them, major economic indicators such as the value of production, market ownership, and sales of engineering machinery such as Trinity Heavy Works, Central and Central Heavy Works, Iron Heavy Works, Mountain River Intelligence, and others have led the same enterprises significantly.
The camera moves with the power of the moment.
The Engineering Mechanics Corps, "Four Great King Kong", is the leader of the Changsha Engineering Machinery Industrial Cluster and the head enterprise of the global engineering machinery industry.
. . . . . . . . . in the world industry's rivers and lakes, who survives and lives well is the hard man to talk.
In earlier years, the global engineering machinery industry had experienced a cold winter, and many internationally known engineering machinery manufacturing companies had fallen, but Changsha 's engineering machinery manufacturing companies had "cat winter as a winter swim", self-stressed, self-breaking, transitioned through industrial structures, from manufacturing to intellectual construction, not only to passing past, but also to a more robust body.
It's thanks to the political conglomerates of the stars.
The development of niche industries requires both positive enterprise development and active government action.
Longsha's reputation for having "the capital of engineering machinery" is that it brings together all-industry chains from upstream to downstream, creates numerous clusters of related industries, and reduces significantly the cost of doing so by optimizing the business environment, improving ancillary services, simplifying the approval process, and so forth, enterprise research and development, manufacturing and marketing.
Good commercial ecology, allowing engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises to flourish.
history has pushed Changsa to the front of the building of a global engineering machine lead, and it's not time for me, not for Jen to.
Both the government and the business, and even the producers and researchers associated with it, should seize the opportunity, move up, bite the target, and continue to work, contributing Hunan's power to building a powerful nation.
The Wang Yi presided over the Foreign Ministers of China and the African States members of the Security Council.

Both sides should be united in strength, settle their disputes through consultation, become self-sufficient in self-empowerment, and govern the essence of development.
The Foreign Ministers of the participating African Member States thanked China for its initiative to convene this meeting and congratulated New China on its 70th anniversary.
The Foreign Ministers stated that Africa-China relations were based on equality and mutual respect, and that Africa and China had always been the most trusted and trusted partners.
The African side appreciates the important and positive role played by China as a permanent member of the Security Council in African affairs, which has contributed significantly to the just and reasonable resolution of African issues and has made great efforts and contributions to the defence of African interests and the promotion of peace and security in Africa.
Today, Africa faces the threat of terrorism and extremism, and only by addressing security issues can Africa truly achieve long-term peace and development.
I look forward to further harmonization of positions with China in the Council and strengthening of solidarity and cooperation.
The Wang Yi said that there was an important consensus at today's meeting.
We all support the preservation of multilateralism, the strengthening of the authority and role of the United Nations, the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rejection of unilateralism and bullying; we all agree to strengthen mutual and supportive cooperation between Central Africa in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council and the common interests of Central Africa and the developing countries in general; we all support African countries in African solutions to African problems and call on the United Nations to provide financial support for African-owned peace operations; we all support the concept of "cooperation for development and development for peace" to help African countries achieve autonomous and sustainable development; and we are firm in our defence of the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and against any country that creates obstacles to developing countries and denies the right to development.

The cooperative takes a foster care approach and directs local farmers to put the good species of lake sheep here, to unify breeding, management, marketing, to achieve good breeding, scientificization, standardization, and intensive farming.
Today, 140 poor households, with sheep entering the stock, split more than $6,000 per household per year, with four build-up cards for poor people working in cooperatives.
From "pleasant grazing" to "precision feeding", from "local mating" to "artificial insemination", from "look at the body, touch the belly" to "behind" to "behind one to do B super" ...in Gansu Qingyang, meat and sheep farming is not just a shift in the way of feeding, but rather a change in the image of a "leading enterprise + cooperative + farmer" that once "stocked sheep on the slopes, marketed sheep", overcoming the weakness of traditional farming, and the poor days of farmers were made better by modernizing sheep.

Suh Jianfeng, general adviser to Gansu Nakashi Rural and Pastoral Development Ltd., said that enterprises were driving more and more poor households to read "the sheep" through the provision of loan guarantees, sheep supply, order farming, bid acquisition, and uniform processing sales services to poor households.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved steady gains through "union" forage farming, good breeding, scale farming, slaughter division, market marketing.
The city of Qingyang is located in the North agricultural staggered belt and is rich in herbiving resources.
There are currently 913 meat and sheep-sized farms in the city, cooperatives, and more than 5 million meat and sheep breeds, as well as the construction of two 1.3 million meat and sheep slaughter-scale processing production lines, the flock of which is becoming a pro-poor "head sheep" in the property.

In introducing France ' s 2020 budget, Lemel stated that the European Central Bank ' s latest monetary easing initiative had created an opportunity for Governments of member countries that could afford to increase investment.
The ECB fell to a new low on 12 September and plans to repurchase debt in order to reduce borrowing costs, in the hope that this will stimulate economic recovery and boost inflation.
. . . . . . . . . low interest rates will not allow Europe to recover prosperity, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"Germany needs to invest, now needs, as soon as possible... don't wait until the situation gets worse before moving on," he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany on several occasions.
France has implemented tax cuts of more than Euro10 billion this year, which has boosted its economic growth.
The global economy has lost momentum, and the German economy, which depends on exports, has borne the brunt.
. . . . . . . Lemel noted that next year the tax burden on French families will be reduced by €9.3 billion, including €5 billion in income tax relief.
In addition, the corporate tax rate will be reduced from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over a five-year period, and the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros.

Study: The United States National Health Dietary Index has grown slightly, but is still challenging - China New Network
On September 27, China News Online reported that, in recent days, a recent study in the United States has shown that the United States Government ' s healthy diet index has grown modestly over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
But when the full score is 100, it's not a celebration.
United States nationals continue to face "visible challenges" in their diet.
According to one of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fang, a research fellow in nutrition at Tafts University, Massachusetts, Americans continue to consume too much food that can cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, which are among the most common diseases among American nationals.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Society on 24 June.
The study was based on the findings of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the United States Government from 1999 to 2016.
The authors wrote that " Despite considerable improvement, significant dietary challenges still exist " .
The challenges are known to include reducing United States nationals' intake of foods containing saturated fats, such as snacks, hot dogs, fat cattle, butter, etc.
The study found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people's daily diet increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, exceeding the recommended intake ceiling of 10 per cent.
The greatest improvement in the diet of American nationals is the reduction in sugar intake from 16 per cent to about 14 per cent, but the intake is still too high.
The official view is that the intake of added sugar should be less than 10% in the daily diet.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There has been a small increase in the intake of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole-food categories by adults in the United States.
The 2016 data, however, show that the proportion of these foods in the daily diet is still less than 5%.
Despite a slight decrease in salt intake and a reduction in drinking juice leading to low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang Fang stated that they still account for up to 42% of daily heat, many of which comes from refined white pasta bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on biennial personal health surveys, which allow adults to remember the food they have eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have asked the question twice every few days since 2003.
The Government ' s Food Guide for Residents of the United States recommends that people adopt a " healthy diet model " to reduce the risk of chronic disease.
The guide notes that people should consume more nutrient-intensive foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, thin meat, poultry, eggs, seed-like foods that can provide proteins.
In the course of the study, the number of people with diabetes among American nationals almost doubled, to over 7%, and obesity increased over many years – today about 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death among American nationals.
EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
A member of the VCCP Central Political Bureau, secretary of the Central Secretariat, and the Secretary of the Central Economy Nguyen Ping Regiment attended the forum.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the Forum focused on the theme " European Union-Asia docking: building bridges for the future of sustainable development " .
The forum was held one year after the implementation of the European Union's docking strategy on two continents.
The President of the Council of the European Union, Jean-Claude Junk, said that the enhanced access was part of the above-mentioned claims, as it brought benefits to the peoples and economies concerned.
The above relationship helps bring stability and prosperity to the parties concerned.
At the same time, he believed that the EU wanted to send a message about increasing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial interface between Europe and Asia.
The Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, is a special guest at the Forum and will make an important speech in the plenary.
The country's first share management subsidiary was set up to fund its operations with technology.
On 26 February, Gwang Da Bank's wholly owned subsidiary, Gwang Da-fi Limited, was officially established in Qingdao, the first joint-stock banking subsidiary to be established in my country.
The experts said that asset management was an important area for the development of financial science and technology, and that the Bank's establishment of financial subsidiaries facilitated its use of technology to upgrade its management operations.
In April of this year, the Bank of Guang Da, and the Bank of Callers issued separate bulletins stating that the China Silver Board of Supervisors had approved the preparation of a finance subsidiary.
On 24 September, the Bank of Guangda announced that Guang Dynasty had been officially granted permission to open its business.
just two days later, the big bank of Guang led many share banks and pioneered the establishment of Guang Dynasty in Qingdao.
The chairman of the Gwang Da Group, Lee Xiao Peng, said that the Gwang Da Group would accelerate the pace of innovation, using modern technological thinking and tools, relying on big data, networking, cloud computing, increasing the coverage, use and penetration of financial capital, and improving the client's sense of access, happiness and security.
By 2021, the establishment of the " four pillars " of sound financial science and technology development in our country will further enhance the capacity of the financial industry to apply science and technology, achieve a deep integration of finance and technology, coordinate development and significantly enhance the satisfaction of the population with digital, networked, and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, chairman of the board of directors of Gwang Dynasty, will use smart investment, smart investment, big data, etc. in the management platform of Gwang Dynasty to help Gwang Dynasty better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, new technologies such as block chains will also be applied to grasp the direction and trends from traditional to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
The National Finance and Development Laboratory's special researcher, Dong Shih-hye, said that in the face of an entirely new competition in the management industry, financial science and technology companies and regulatory agencies would explore new growth paths with management science and technology.
The financial science and technology enabling industry is both a need for financial science and technology itself to transform development, and more so to breathe new life and dynamism into the development of management operations.
At the beginning of this year, Kyoto Digital Technology launched a new management technology system to enhance the research and development and wind control capacity of the management's products through technology and digitization.
The new system starts with product design, sales transactions, asset management, and risk assessment of four major capabilities to upgrade the overall intelligent operation of the management industry.

Zhang Xuyang stated that previous risk preferences to locate customers through questionnaires were prone to bias, while the use of artificial intelligence for user graphics now helped better locate customers and introduced corresponding products based on the client's investment preferences, helping to mitigate risks.
"An alternative large data such as electricians, time and space data can help us better map a region, the level of activity of an industry, and the extent of the landscape."
Zhang Xuyang said that, while mitigating risks, big data technology would also help to improve wind control capabilities.
China Railway Tunnel's deepest record was refreshed.
On 27 September, after more than 1,200 days of day-to-day construction, China's Social Security Hill (Zhang Wei Minh, Zhou Jingbo) completed excavations on 27 September in the construction of the Ji Da (Ri) Ry (Li) railway Taka Ligon Mountain Tunnel No. 1 shaft, which reached a depth of 76.259 metres below ground level, breaking the deepest record of China's railway tunnel shafts, which was created in the event of a heavy water surge.
The 34.5-km-long Dari Railway Gauligong Mountain Tunnel is located in Yunnan and the Tunnel runs across the Highligon Mountains in the West Bank of the Furious River, the longest single-hole tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel runs through 19 fracture zones and is buried at a maximum depth of 1155 metres, as it covers almost all possible adverse geological and significant risks to tunnel construction, and the Gauligon Mountain Tunnel is known as the "geological museum " of tunnel construction.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The successful excavation of the 1st shaft to the bottom of the well marked the official entry of the Gauligong Mountain Tunnel into the horizontal tunnel for construction, and the addition of four additional operating surfaces to the shaft after the wellground has been dug and the equipment replaced, accelerating the tunnel's opening hole.
"The shafts are all in granite formations, and the depth of water pressure of the wells is essentially as a result of the fact that the granite layers are more cleavages and cannot stop with the water and flow from top to bottom. "
The Chief Engineer of the Dari Railway Project of the Central Iron Tunnel Department told reporters that during the construction of the shaft, there had been a number of risks, such as mudslides and collapses, and that the construction party had invited experts to take the pulse on the spot, and that more than 20 studies had been conducted to deal with the programme.
" When the water surges in the shafts are greatest, it reaches more than 300 cubic metres per hour, over 700 metres deep at the bottom of the well, and the water pressure is equivalent to 700 metres deep at the sea floor. "
" If you don't pump drainage in time, you'll flood the well 10 metres in an hour, we'll use almost 85% of our time to cure the water and 15% of our time to dig in. "
In order to overcome the geological difficulties of longitudinal spire development of the 1st shaft, mudslides and water-rich granite, tunnel construction uses a combination of "probes, notes, digs" of systematic water treatment measures to reduce construction risks.
Following several improvements, the construction of the 1st shaft formed an open-drilling system, out-of-the-mill system, suspension system, and mechanized water flow lines such as the winch upgrade system, which achieved full-process mechanization operations such as eye-hitting, blasting, outbursting, template installation, concrete construction, and accelerated construction.

When Hong Kong returned to its home country, it remained close to the Mainland, making progress together and sharing fruitful results.
It is believed that, in the context of the "one country, two systems", Hong Kong's future can continue to play an advantage in taking advantage of the "one country, one country, the other" and the opportunity of the Australasia Bay region of Hong Kong to seek a better future for Hong Kong.
She also stated that Hong Kong society had been in dispute over the past few months, that every Hong Kong man had been affected and that journalists faced different challenges.
At this critical juncture, it is hoped that the friends of the press will continue to face up, be professional, be just for society, be balanced in journalism, and do their part for the future of Hong Kong, and return society to rational communication dialogue.
In his message, Kang noted that the Gwang-hsiung journey to the new China was also a journey for Hong Kong to develop with its motherland, to progress together, to be linked with blood, and to be honored with one another.
In particular, since the return of Hong Kong to its home country, the centre has been steadfast in its " one country, two systems " , " the Hong Kong people, " the Hong Kong people " , a high degree of self-government, and Hong Kong ' s solidarity with the Mainland and the people of the Mainland, helping to keep watch, together creating the miracle of mutually beneficial win-win and economic flight.
For this reason, Hong Kong's press gathered to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
He stated that over the past three months, there has been a series of flagrant violations of the law, wanton acts of violence that destabilized society, and that some of the media have published distortions and false reports, which have contributed to the violence.
He called on the media to excite and create a good atmosphere for the population to resist violence and uphold the rule of law.
A professional mediaman is required to adhere to the norms of the press profession, to guide citizens to their self-conscious and violent seats with genuine reporting and responsible speech, and to uphold the justice and integrity of the law.
The Hong Kong press, among others, has about 500 people attending wine fairs and raised a cup with the guest of the main gift, giving blessings to the People's Republic of China on its 70th anniversary.

Pilot notification of commitments in areas such as licensing the production of low-risk varieties of food, decentralization of foreign business representatives to the Free Trade Area
On 27 February, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority signed a memorandum of work with the Government of the New District of Pudong, introducing 20 market regulatory reform measures, some of which were pioneered and piloted throughout the country.
It is explained that notification of a promise means that the administrative authorities, when dealing with the registration of a permit, inform the applicant in writing of the conditions and requirements laid down in the law and regulations once.
After the applicant has signed the commitment, the administrative authorities can proceed directly with it.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority will provide support for the registration of enterprises in the Pudong New Zone and the Shanghai Free Trade Test Zone, the processing of simple processes, licences for the production of low-risk varieties of food products, and partial measuring device type approvals to inform the commitment system on a pilot basis to make access to enterprises easier.
Shanghai's Life Food Company Limited 27 was the first enterprise to benefit from the pilot dividend by informing the commitment to obtain a " food production license " on the spot.
The head of the business said that food permits could also be obtained on the spot, and that a "discretionary" approach had been adopted, which allowed the enterprise to submit part of the material in accordance with the deadline agreed upon in the letter of commitment, " effectively felt the ease of the reform ... "
The Shanghai Market Regulatory Department stated that the implementation of a notice commitment to food production licences was a national pioneer pilot.
Following the reform, the approval chain was reduced from the previous "Registration, Reception, On-site Verification, Sample Testing, Material Examination, Approval Certificates "Six Stages Constricted to "Registration, Reception, Approval Certificates" to 3 Stages, with completion time reduced from 20 working days prior to the reform, to on-the-spot closure.
Taking into account the high external orientation of the Podong economy, the Shanghai market regulator delegated registration to the Shanghai Free Trade Zone of the permanent representative institutions of foreign (regional) enterprises to facilitate the close proximity of enterprises.
The statistics show that this decentralization involved a total of 1592 permanent representative institutions in the Shanghai Free Trade Area, of which 99 had been processed in accordance with the new regulations.
The "xi" long fake consumption small survey: the choice is more diverse and tourism takes first place.
The National Day is approaching, and people's vacation plans are being finalized.
The Securities Daily News reporter recently launched a small survey in the Friends Circle on the 11th holiday arrangements, and received almost 20 feedback indicating that while there are differences in your plans, "Tourism + Consumption" becomes the key word for the 11th holiday.
In particular, in the feedback received by the Journal of Securities journalists, over half of the people chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said that " during the ‘11' period it was planned to take his family to Shanghai and Disney was the first stop before going to the surrounding cities " ; Ms. Li of Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan, " a three-mouthed woman who set out on 28 September and planned a trip around the island for ten days " ; Miss Chongqing planned an out-country trip to Singapore; and Mr. Zhang of Hebei chose to swim on his own, saying " Daughters under two years old, away from the far side are not convenient, plan to drive herself to Shandong and play by sea for a few days " .
The 2019 National Day Gold Week Residents Travel and Travel Trends Report, released jointly with fellow tourists in recent days, shows a clear trend towards an escalation of consumption in three subdivisions of this year's National Day Gold Week travel and travel.
The penetration rate of aircraft, high-terrestrial trips has steadily increased, and the demand for individualized non-standard accommodation has increased in the Star-class hotel.
On September 23, the United States released the 2019 National Day of Tourism Consumption Trends Report, which showed that tourism consumption continued to flourish and presented an increase in diversification of "food and play".
More young people travel in favour of high-quality, distinctive experiences, cultural tourism, night tourism, and other heats that continue to rise.
In addition to tourism, various types of consumer demand were released centrally during the XI period.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the Journal of Securities that "the main plan for '11' this year is to buy a car."
A Beijing-based car brand 4S shop staff said to the Securities Journal reporter that, in general, the month of September and October of each year are known as the gold period for car sales.
The door shop will launch a number of activities during the XI period, such as taking prizes, going to the store to drop down.
A number of other recent brands have introduced new models, and the boosting effect of the new product on sales is expected to be more pronounced.
In the context of the upward trend in consumption, more emphasis is being placed on the proportion of services consumed at the spiritual level of demand satisfaction, culture, education and so on.
Ms. Doo, who lives in Beijing, said, " Since the birth of the child, culture, education consumption has become the largest consumer spending in the family.
This year '11's row is full, going to the 'Caca' Astronomy, the Children ' s Theatre, about a couple of family weekends to camp in tents at the Elk Museum, and also to arrange some quiz lessons. "
According to insiders, in theory, the way in which consumption escalation takes place for residents is the evolution of subsistence consumption to developmental and enjoyable consumption, in which a significant portion of the enjoyable consumption is in the category of service consumption.
As our economic society continues to grow and the income levels of the population rise, people are increasingly focusing on consumption demand at the spiritual level, tourism, and travel is a good way to go.
In particular, catching up with the 11th National Day break, time is more adequate and people are more willing to travel and consume, which both meets the demand for consumption at the spiritual level and reflects an escalation of consumption by residents.
I started lonely in the afternoon and I didn't want to go out, and I haven't adjusted my children's absence.

A look at the walls, just at 7 o'clock, and the sunset in the sunrise country is early, and the sky is dark.
The moon was invented in the circle of friends, and it was mid-Autumn today.
I washed a bunch of grapes sent by friends, left half for Boo, and put the rest in the little flower bowl that I liked, and ended up looking at the moon.

Chinese students can apply for German undergraduate studies from next year on the basis of their high grades.
In recent days, the Anabin database, which is responsible for assessing academic qualifications abroad, has been announced by the network of officials: starting in 2020, high school graduates in China can apply directly for undergraduate studies at German universities based on their high qualifications, without the need to register first at domestic universities.
Before that, Chinese high school graduates wanted to apply for a German university, they had to study one semester (211,985) or three semesters (ordinary undergraduate), and passed the APS audit or TestAS examination in the country.
The release of the new rules, or at least half a year, will save Chinese students who are willing to study in Germany.
It is known that the new regulations will enter into force in the second half of 2019.
The applicant is required to complete 12 years of regular compulsory education and obtain a high school diploma; attend the board examination, a high examination and a high score of 70 per cent or more of the total score (more than 525 if the total score is 750) and include the requirements of two language grades and one math or natural science achievement.
In addition, specific professional requirements for high-level examinations vary.
For example, applying for specialties such as medicine, oral medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacology, higher examination scores must reach 80% of the full score, and higher examination subjects must contain at least two in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, or participate in the basics; applying for a legal class, higher examination scores must reach 80% of the full score, and higher examination subjects must contain foreign languages, history, at least two in geography, or participate in the ensemble.
According to incomplete statistics, there are now a number of countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, etc., that have endorsed China's high examination results.
In the United Kingdom, for example, universities such as Cambridge University, Birmingham University, and Leicester University accepted Chinese students to apply for high school.

Through a wealth of data and facts, the White Paper describes the tremendous achievements, significance and contribution of the world in China ' s development over the past 70 years.
The White Paper states that China has spent several decades on completing the centuries of development in developed countries, and that the economy is the second-largest in the world, with nearly 1.4 billion people emerging from material shortages, generally reaching a level of minor well-being, enjoying unprecedented dignity and rights.
The White Paper emphasizes that for 70 years, the Chinese people have started their home in vain, self-reliance, hard work and a new world; for 70 years, China has developed in its contacts with the world, embracing the world, learning from it and contributing to it; and for 70 years, China has contributed to world peace while achieving self-development, and has injected momentum into the common development of all nations.
The White Paper states that, over the past 70 years, China ' s development has been successful essentially because, under the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the right path to China ' s distinctive socialism and have steadfastly followed it.
The White Paper emphasizes that China's distinctive socialist path is a path that has been set out in the national context, a path that places the interests of the people first, a path to reform and innovation, a path to common development in openness, and a path to a State that is fully governed by the rule of law.
This path of development in China, which is in line with Chinese national conditions and adapted to the demands of the times, will show a brighter outlook for development as the times move forward.
In response to the concerns of the international community about China's development, the White Paper emphasizes that the attainment of national prosperity, national revitalization and the well-being of the people are the dreams of both the Chinese people and the common dreams of all peoples.
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of world economic growth, that all aspects of openness to the outside world create more opportunities for national development, that China provides more public goods to the international community, that China ' s development provides experience and lessons for other developing countries, and that China will never follow the path of "power-driven hegemony".

The White Paper states that China's development is dependent on the world, on its peaceful development and on its prosperity and stability.
China has always placed its development among the coordinates of human development. China has always insisted on cooperation in winning and winning, developing together, preserving and promoting economic globalization, actively developing a global partnership, firmly supported multilateralism, upholding international equity and justice, and promoting the building of "one side" of high-quality development. It has actively participated in leading the reform and construction of the global system of governance.

At present, China has entered a new era of development.
The White Paper states that the determination of China in the new era to follow the path of China's distinctive socialistism will not change, to learn from one another, to win together with others, and to join hands with the world will not change.
The White Paper concludes by stating that the future of nations in today's world has never been so closely linked as it is.

Did Mahua go to the By-election for the State of Johor's Dundeeby-Ai Conference?
The Governor of the Mahua General, the Governor of Sri Wei's family, said: " Controversy to the Supreme Council! "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
However, after the meeting of the Central Committee of Mahua, it was announced that it would be handed over to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether this Mahua traditional seat would continue to be played by Mahua or replaced by the other member parties.
On Thursday afternoon, after presiding over the meeting of the Central Committee of Mahua, Wei said to the media that any by-election would be conducted by the National Front in accordance with the standard operating procedure (SOP), i.e., after a meeting through the Supreme Council of the National Front, before a decision could be made.
He said that, since the Electoral Commission would not meet until Monday (1 day) to finalize the by-election for the Danvuby-Ai seat, the FLNKS Supreme Council meeting was expected to take place in early October.
"Yesterday (26), yesterday morning, I also met with the President of the National Front, Dato ' Seri Azadzhi, and we all agreed on the need to regain this seat from the League of Hope. "
"We have finalized the convening of a special FLNKS leadership meeting in early October, and the FLNKS three party leaders will determine which party will fight. "
Inquiring as to whether the Mahua would insist on standing in this traditional seat to the Supreme Council of the National Front, Wei Jiaxi reiterated that, as President of the Mahua General, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures, so that any decision must have a consensus of the National Front.
" In any by-election, there is a willingness to march, there are political parties, and there is a certain feeling that they should come out, which is a common thing ... "
"What organization and political alliance do we come from?"
" This is the great test of our political alliance over the years, and we believe that the National Front has come along with some valuable values. "
"In this process, someone might say something, and that's weird. "
" But once the Supreme Council of the PFDJ has made a decision, everyone must be ready for war, which is the most valuable... "
In any event, Wei Jiaxiang said that Mahua would make every effort to prepare for the coming Danyuby-Ai seat by-election at three levels, namely the district council, the state board and the centre.
" The district council side is headed by the chairman of the (Dandubai) district council, the governor of Sri Huang Day; the state board, the director of the Joozhou Board, the director of the board, the governor of Lin Pae-hing; and, at the central level, by the director of the bureau, the director of Mahahansu and the general secretary, the governor of Zhang Zhang Zhang himself.

A villager hunting wildlife in Paukang County, Hubei, was ordered to make a "compulsory mountain tour."
. A villager in Pacon County, Hubei, was sentenced for hunting wildlife, and was ordered to pay $15420 (in RMB, the same amount) for restoration of environmental damage to ecological resources.
As a result of the poverty of the accused's family, the Public Prosecution Service initiated alternative labour to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration, achieving an organic unity of legal and social effects.
The Deputy Attorney-General of Paukang County, Wang Zhongyan, introduced on the 27th day that, through alternative labour such as a three-month "compulsory mountain tour", the accused had established deep feelings with wild monkeys and was deeply responsible for his previous animal hunting.
On 21 June of this year, a criminal incidental civil public interest case in the field of ecological resources was filed by the Public Prosecutor's Office of Paukang County, which was heard in public and pronounced in court in the County Court.
The accused was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, four years' probation and a fine of $3,000, while ordering him to compensate $15420 for environmental damage to ecological resources.

However, taking into account the poor financial situation of one of the families in the week, coordinated by the Public Prosecutor's Office of Paukang County, the local village council, Forest Station, and one of the three parties in the week reached an agreement on alternative labour to compensate for ecological rehabilitation costs: i.e., one week or so, through the provision of domestic care for monkey domestication in the Village Monkey Reserve, compulsory mountain patrols, forest protection for one year, and the provision of public goods to cover the cost of ecological restoration.
In response to the prosecutor's recommendation, the court accepted that the obligation of "alternative labour to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration" should be actively fulfilled while agreeing to a reprieve sometime in the week.

In recent years, the Public Prosecutor's Office of Paoucon County has, in practice, organically integrated prosecutorial functions and social governance practices, scientific application of prosecutorial recommendations, investigation supervision, litigation supervision, and other forms of supervision, with judicial means, to minimize the damage to the ecological environment caused by criminal acts.
The United Nations awarded the Earth Guard Award for Ant Forest.
In the loud applause and the music of the restoration, Xu Yi, the head of the "Ant Forest" project, and the user's representative, Shen Jiang Liang, came to the podium and picked up the trophy from the host for the 2019 United Nations "Earthguard Award".
The 2019 Earthguard Award was held in New York, United States, on the 26th of the year, and the "Ant Forest" project, which brought hundreds of millions of people into environmental action with cell phone applets, was awarded the "Incentives and Actions Award".
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced its award-winning list at its headquarters in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, but the people who attended the ceremony that day were still unconvinced.
In an interview with Xinhua journalist, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Inge Annozon, said that "Ant Forest" was an exciting innovation that brought hundreds of millions of people together to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans could do to the environment.
It connects people and the environment with technology, allowing every individual to participate in the protection of the Earth, which will have a huge impact.
The Ant Forest was launched in August 2016 by the China Ant Financial Services Group (known as the Ant Gold Suit) on the Pay Treasure Platform, where users build "green energy" through low-carbon actions such as recording their daily trips in the Ant Forest, paying water and electricity online, and "planting trees" in mobile phones.
Every time a user grows a virtual tree, "Ant Forest" and a public good partner grow a real tree in a desertification area.
As of August this year, 500 million "Ant Forest" users have accumulated carbon reductions of 7.92 million tons and have planted 122 million trees in desertification areas.
On the same day, Costa Rica was awarded the Earthguard Award for its national environmental efforts, and Costa Rica's winner, Carlos Alvarado, praised the contribution of the Ant Forest on the spot, " capable of motivating so many people to participate in green action, impressively " .
The chairman and CEO of the ant gold suit, Hyun-do Well, stated that the "Earth Guard Award" was a positive recognition of the "Ant Forest" project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for people to participate in low-carbon lives, an honour that belongs to all participants.
According to Io Hyun-hoon, the "Ant Forest" has affected 500 million people over the past three years, and the goal of the "Ant Forest" for the next three years is to engage 1 billion people worldwide in low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers' incomes more derived from Green Water in Green Mountain.
In addition to providing employment through tree planting, it is hoped that farmers will be helped to achieve increased harvests through agricultural development projects, electrician platforms, etc.
The public good environmental model created by the Ant Forest has also been successful in sailing and has been drawn upon by other countries.
This June, the Philippines ' largest "electronic purse" GCash launched the Philippine version of Ant Forest to encourage Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.
It was described that GCash would work with the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, the Environmental Public Interest Organization and others to plan to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the start of the project.
The Earthguard Award is the highest award in the environmental field of the United Nations and is awarded annually.
The Ant Forest was awarded the award for its "Incentives and Actions" award for the third consecutive year for a green innovation project from China, following the construction of the Chinese Sehan Dam Forestyard, China 's Chimura Demonstration, Wanmura Remediation' project in Zhejiang Province.

The United States Economic Report Card for the second quarter of this year shows that, affected by a significant decline in private sector investment and exports, the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States slowed significantly over the previous quarter.
The analysts pointed out that trade friction and the uncertainty it brings are the main causes of the downturn in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revision data published by the U.S. Department of Commerce on 26 September show that US GDP grew by 2% per year in the second quarter, the same as the revised data previously published, but significantly below 3.1% in the first quarter.
The data show that consumer growth has become a major factor underpinning the growth of the United States economy in the second quarter.
The proportion of individual consumption spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the total United States economy, increased by 4.6 per cent in the current season, pushing economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government spending on consumption and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter was 6.3% lower than in the previous quarter, delaying growth by 1.16 percentage points; exports by 5.7% lower than in the previous quarter, and net exports by 0.68 percentage points.
According to Barry Knapp, the managing partner of Einside Macroeconomics Consulting in the United States, private sector investment not only failed to maintain the momentum of last year's growth, but instead saw a significant decline, as the rise in trade friction and uncertainty had hit corporate confidence.
. . . . . . Knapp believes that, under the influence of policy uncertainty, U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to remain in a downward trend next year.
According to analysts, despite the strong support of consumer growth for the second quarter of the United States economy, there are increasing signs that trade-related friction and the uncertainty it brings have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected American consumption prospects.
The head of the investigation, Richard Curtin, Professor of Economics at the University of Michigan, said recently that, in the most recent survey, 38 per cent of consumers spontaneously referred to the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, a percentage that was a new high in a year and a half.
For future economic developments in the United States, analysts are generally of the view that the United States economy will continue to slow down.
However, experts also said that if trade friction were to be eased, the performance of the United States industrial sector and financial markets would improve.

The chief economist for Moody Analysis, Mark Zandy, predicted that, assuming that trade friction would not continue to escalate, the growth of the United States economy would be 2.3% this year and would slow further to 1.6% next year.

According to Matt Mealey, stock strategist for Miller-Tabak Asset Management, trade friction remains a "prior issue " and is the main cause of the large volatility of the capital markets in the United States this year, and whether trade friction can be properly addressed will be the key to influencing the direction of the capital markets in the United States for the rest of the year.
The parents of children between the ages of 0 and 3 are entitled to 10 days ' leave per year for the first couple in Ningxia
The guarantee of the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respect for and guarantee of human rights and an important sign of the progress of social civilization.
On 27 September, at the fifteenth session of the twelfth session of the Standing Committee of the Ningxia Hui People ' s Congress, a high-vote " Regulation on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region " was adopted.
This is the first local regulation of Ningxia Province to be issued for the protection of women's legitimate rights and interests in a comprehensive system, which will be formally implemented as of 1 November 2019.
It is understood that the "regulations" adopted on this occasion were revised in 2007 on the basis of the Ningxia Implementation of the Measures of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women, divided into 9 chapters, article 65, which includes general principles, political rights, cultural and educational rights and interests, labour and social security rights and interests, property rights, personal rights, marital and family rights and interests, legal responsibilities, and by-laws.
In the Regulation, Ningxia encouraged the exploration of joint parental leave between husband and wife, the first of its kind in the country.
This year, in April, the "Guidance on promoting the development of infant and child care services for children under the age of 3" issued by the Office of the State Council has a relevant description of couples' joint parenting.
In the process of amending the Regulations, Ningxia 's innovation proposes "to encourage employers to take joint parental leave for couples with children for 10 days each year between the ages of zero and three " .
At the same time, the Regulation highlights the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative results from the current Chinese civil code Personal Status Code, detailing the constituent elements of sexual harassment, subjects and mechanisms for combating sexual harassment, etc.
Article 44 of the Regulation explicitly prohibits frequent cases of sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to carry out the relevant education, protection and prevention work as a new marker for the protection of girls in local legislation.
With regard to women's right to know and dispose of the common property of a married family, article 35 of the Ordinance clearly defines women's right to know and the obligations of property registration bodies and related subjects, providing solid institutional support for women's defence of their rights.
In addition, in response to social hot spots – gender discrimination in employment – section 26 of the Ordinance prohibits not only direct discrimination, but also indirect discrimination, and draws on recent experience in the practice of joint interviews, strengthens disciplinary measures for gender-based discrimination offences and strengthens the defence of women's legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the Ningxia Women ' s Union ' s Joint Public Prosecutions and Law Division, Civil Administration, etc., have been very effective in promoting and introducing social professional forces into the mediation of marital and family disputes and the fight against domestic violence.

The reporter was informed on 27 January by the administration of the Heung UNITA in the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia that the "Hing UNITA Yuan Longping staff station for saline rice site survey and acceptance council" held just before the Union had posted good news that saline rice average acre production of rice had broken a thousand pounds.
A team of six experts from the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of Heilongjiang Province, Janzhou University, and Hunan Rural Department of Agriculture, conducted a sample harvest of rice from the Hing Salt Series on site.
The average salt-resistant rice rice acre production of 508.8 kg of rice was measured by experts at PH values 8.8 to 9.6 and salinity levels of 5 to 6 per 1,000 land.
The Chief Wang Shi, the executive station of the Yuanlongping headquarters of Hing UNITA, said, " Our next intention is to build on this year ' s trials, to innovate and to reform, to develop and optimize salt-resistant rice varieties again, to make them better quality and more productive. "
" I believe that, in the absence of the same factors of production, the continuous strengthening of the scientific and technical clearances, salin-resistant rice will also continue to produce miracles on the salin lands. "
The Heung UNITA is part of the special hardship area of the Great Xingan Ridge South.
In October 2018, the Yuanlong Pings worked to stand up for UNITA's unveiling.
The Yuanlong Pings led the team of experts to accelerate the introduction of the latest growing "salt-resistant hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technologies, building 960 acres of salline-resistant rice bases on the central flag of the Kolzun right, using a side-test demonstration and a technical route to scale up the local poor to boost their yields and lift them out of poverty.
This saline-resistant rice field survey provides a scientific basis not only for the promotion of low- and middle-yielding fields to medium- and high-yielding fields in Xing UNITA saline, but also for the cultivation of saline rice under the same conditions in our country.

Beriegiklen defended his absentee vote, saying, " I need to spend my time running the whole new state. "
The Australian Liberal MP Davis was known to have been the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, having threatened to withdraw from the new state government as a result of the bill, and calling it a "government crisis " .
But afterwards, Davis made concessions.
According to Davis: " The content of the amendment to the abortion legalisation bill submitted to the House of Representatives in the morning of 26, in fact provides more guarantees for women, doctors ... "
At the same time, Barillaro, the leader of the New State of Australia's National Party, said that he was proud to be part of the government that legalized abortion.
" Our achievements last night were historic for the new state, which legalized abortion, which was no longer a crime and would not treat abortion women as criminals. "

The Minister of Finance, Liu Quin: 67 companies and financial institutions have transferred $8.61 billion to fund the Social Security Fund.
The Minister of Finance, Liu Quin, stated on 27 February that, to date, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions had completed the transfer of part of the State-owned capital to replenish the Social Security Fund, bringing the total amount of transferred State-owned capital to approximately $860.1 billion.
The statement was made on the same day at a national mission deployment meeting on the transfer of part of the State capital to complement the work of the Social Security Fund, convened jointly by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the National Finance Commission.
" The transfer of part of the State-owned capital to the Social Security Fund is an important initiative to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system, a full expression of the universal sharing of the results of State-owned enterprise development and the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system, and is an immediate, long-term policy measure ... "
In 2017, the Department of State issued a programme for the transfer of part of the State-owned capital to complement the implementation of the Social Security Fund, calling for the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces for piloting.
. According to Liu Quin, the pre-transfer process has had positive results.
At the central level, three batches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been completed for conversion, with the total transfer of state-owned capital amounting to approximately $8,611 million.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions from the Ministry of Finance to carry out the responsibility of funders has been largely completed.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the local level, the pre-diversion work of the enterprise is carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang, Yunnan Province, had been largely completed, transferring State capital of $15.8 billion and $18.5 billion, respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have successively carried out pre-transfer preparations, laying the foundation for the next implementation of the transfer.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources Social Security, the National Finance Commission, the General Tax Administration, and the day before the SEC, the central and local transfer of part of the State-owned capital into the Social Security Fund was fully rolled out in 2019 and largely completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held that day made a specific deployment for the full roll-out of the conversion.
It was stressed that the transfer should be carried out pragmatically and efficiently.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Transfer time is tight and tasks are heavy ... "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The State transfer to the Social Security Fund – starting from the starting point of the "Facilitation of the Social Security Fund's Money Bag" – is intended to provide a strong support for pension security.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Services, the National Council, the General Tax Administration and the Securities and Supervision Board jointly issued a " Circular on the Full Transfer of Part of State Capital to Supplement the Work of the Social Security Fund " , specifying the timetable for the transfer of State funds to the Social Security Fund, i.e., the transfer of parts of State capital from the central and local levels to supplement the work of the Social Security Fund, which was fully opened in 2019.
After the release of the document, departments such as the Ministry of Finance were also implemented quickly.
On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance transferred to the Social Security Fund 10 per cent of the shareholding of the business bank, the agricultural bank, and the transfer of the two shares to a total value of over $1150 billion.
According to the regulations, subjects such as the Social Security Foundation, as financial investors, have the right to gain, dispose of and be informed of the shares assigned to the State.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In response, the pen believes that a similar transfer of shares from a State enterprise is not a simple change in the attribution of shares, but a "plus calculation" that can trigger a series of effects.
The first step of some State transfers to social security, the " plus result " , can naturally reflect universal ownership of State-owned enterprises and the sharing of development results.
After many years of reform and development, State enterprises, especially conglomerates, are mostly in important industries and areas of our economy, with greater overall profitability and stability.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On 10 July, the Standing Meeting of the State Council decided that this year the transfer of part of the State-owned capital to complement the work of the Social Security Fund would be fully implemented.
The Ministry of Finance then indicated that it would work with the relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Meeting of the State Council, to fully transfer part of the State-owned capital to complement the Social Security Fund, fully reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the sharing of the results of State-owned enterprise development.
The second step of the transfer, the "plus result " , is to enhance the sustainability of our social security fund and further strengthen the foundations of the pension social security system.
With the ageing of the population, our social security funds are under pressure, and most of this time, as State funds that have been diverted, have the capacity to sustain profits and dividends, not only to be able to effectively supplement the social security fund, but also to provide a source of living water for the social security fund.
There are measurements showing a 1 per cent reduction in the contribution ratio to support basic old-age insurance in enterprises for each 3.8 percentage point transfer of state capital.
The third step of the transfer, the "plus result", was to add stabilizers to the capital market.
The way in which this transfer to the subject receives the proceeds is "red to the main and operates as a complement " .
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor in State-owned capital, is indeed based on the acquisition of dividends.
However, the Social Security Fund, as a value investor in capital markets, has a stronger capacity to operate capital.
For listed assets in State-owned capital, the participation of the Social Security Fund in holding shares will further optimize the governance structure of corporate entities in listed enterprises and contribute to raising the level of business operations, with a positive and positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the increase in the share weight of the Social Security Fund, as an investment windmark, has helped to further increase its influence in the market and to act as a "stabler" in the market.

Iran has been confirmed to have developed advanced centrifuges and suspended further implementation of the Iran nuclear protocol.
According to Central, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated on September 26 that Iran had once again violated the Iran Nuclear Agreement by using advanced centrifugal mechanisms to enrich uranium.
It is reported that Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran nuclear agreement in response to United States President Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement in May 2018 and the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran has suspended two other commitments in July to keep enriched uranium stocks below 300 kg and enriched uranium not exceeding 3.67% purity, and there are further moves now.
In accordance with the nuclear agreement, Iran could only set up about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, and, in addition, only allow Iran to use a small number of more advanced machine types for research, but not to produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for the manufacture of nuclear bombs.
According to the report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that " on 25 September, the Agency had confirmed that Iran ' s advanced centrifuges of Type 2, Type 3 of the R & D aircraft were accumulating or were ready to accumulate enriched uranium " .
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency submitted this report to Member States on 26 February, and a diplomatic official responded that " they are busy at the uranium enrichment facility in Natanz ... "

China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper (70 years in New China): China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper states that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper says that as China's combined national power and international influence have risen rapidly, there are international fears that China will follow the path of the "power-power rule", and some have put forward the so-called "China threat theory".
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The attainment of national prosperity, the revitalization of the nation and the well-being of the people are the dreams of both the Chinese people and the common dreams of all peoples.
" China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge. "
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of world economic growth, that China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, that China ' s science, technology and innovation have injected new dynamic energy into world economic growth and that the role of the future stabilizers and power sources in China ' s economy has become more prominent.
The current world economy is not dynamic enough, and a robust Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to the world.
The Chinese economy is moving from high-speed growth to high-quality development, new forms of industrialization, informationization, urbanization, accelerated modernization of agriculture, structural adjustment of the economy, industrial optimization and continuous upgrading of new economic growth points.
" A study by the McKinsey Institute of Global Studies concluded that, by 2040, the integration of China and the rest of the world ' s economies is expected to create an economic value of between $22 trillion and $37 trillion, equivalent to 15 - 26% of the global economy ' s total, and that enhanced cooperation between the rest of the world ' s economies and China would create significant economic value ... "
The White Paper emphasizes that the Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and have been deeply integrated.
In China, where the economy is functioning more steadily, growth is of higher quality and growth prospects are sustainable, it is a long-term benefit for world economic development.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to see China ' s economic development as a "threat" and a "challenge" to try to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain, value chain, and "decoupling " China from the world economy.
The White Paper states that full-fledged openness to the public creates more opportunities for countries to share the "China dividend".
China is firmly committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, with greater intensity and higher levels of openness to the outside world, China has the world's most potential consumer market, China is the most attractive destination for investment, and more large-scale "walking out" benefits more countries.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Mutual benefit can only last in the long term. "
The White Paper states that China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment, strengthening intellectual property protection, and that other countries should also expand their openness and take corresponding initiatives in an effort to improve their business environment.
It is only by moving towards each other that an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, win-win development environment can be created, and together the "cake" of development will be made bigger and will form a mutually beneficial win-win community of interests.
The White Paper states that China provides more public goods to the international community.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
" China ' s development has benefited from the international community and has never forgotten to give back to the family of nations in order to provide the international community with more and better public goods ... "
In a recent written interview with a reporter from Xinhua, the General Manager of the Russian Export Centre, André Slepniov, stated that Russia was ready to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic and trade field, further optimize export structures and promote diversification of Russian exports to China.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . in Russia's exports to China, the forestry, mechanical manufacturing and chemical industries account for a significant proportion, while, at the same time, the export of agricultural products is also very important, including both grease, meat and dairy products, and cereals, fish and seafood.
In recent years, Russian non-materials, non-energy products and Chinese exports have also shown good and stable development.
Turning to Russia's optimization of its export structure to China, Slepnioff said that the Russian side had set a mandate to expand exports of high-tech products to meet the import demand for high-technology products from countries and regions around the world, including China.
Next, Russia will improve financial and non-financial support measures to promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There is also great potential for cooperation between the Russian and Chinese sides in the area of urban environmental development.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Turning to the two countries' goal of achieving $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2024, Slepnioff said that areas such as agriculture, mechanical manufacturing, the chemical industry and forestry would play an important role in achieving that goal.
The Russian side intends to promote the diversification of supply in these areas and the export of deep-processed products.
He stressed that the Russian side intended to advance its exporters into the global value-added chain, in which China was one of the directions of development.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and natural gas, and chemicals are well placed to participate in the process.
At present, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises " to establish more Russian-Chinese joint ventures and jointly develop exports to third countries " .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the same time, the Russian export centre will continue to deepen its cooperation with China's relevant sectors to facilitate easier access to the Chinese market for Russian goods and to develop new types of Chinese export products.

The spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded at the regular press conference in response to a recent visit to United Nations Headquarters by Chinese officials to attend a conference on religious issues, saying that the little move was not honorable and that the muss laughed at large.

The authorities have shown a strong crackdown.
The Twitter theme tag and social media are strongly advocating for the Egyptian masses to take up the streets today to peacefully demand the departure of President Sessi.
But the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
The expression of dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt since the then-Chief of the Military, Sessi, launched a military coup in 2013, and any form of protest is more likely to be in extreme danger.
The British Guardian reported that the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a non-governmental organization in Cairo, had stated that more than 1900 people had been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests last weekend calling for Sessie to step down.
The corruption allegations surrounding Cessy's and his family's squandering in pursuit of vanity led thousands of people to go to the streets to demonstrate from 20 days.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior firmly stated yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country would be decisively met with no soft hand.
The city centre of Cairo has long been heavily guarded and riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes police are seen everywhere in the streets around Tahrir Square, where the 2011 Egyptian Revolution detonated.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained several important scholars and social sages on 25 days, including Professor of Political Science at Cairo University, and well-known columnist Nafa.
" I have no doubt that the continuation of Cessy ' s absolute rule will cause disaster. "
"It's in Egypt's interest that he step down immediately."

You've got a lot to do with your exercise?
According to Russian satellite networks, a study of athletes shows that the brain also shows signs of fatigue after high-intensity exercise.
The study, led by Mathieus Pesigreon, expert at the Pittier-Salpetr Hospital in France, shows that there is an unclear link between brain and manual labour: both require cognitive control of the activity.
Pesigreon explained: " You need to control the autonomous process of forcing yourself to stop when muscles and joints are in pain. "
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Sport and Physical Education (INSEP).
The school's experts are responsible for directing athletes to prepare for the Olympic Games.
A number of athletes have begun to suffer from over-training syndromes, i.e. an irrepressible sense of fatigue after high-load exercise, physical inability to recover and a decline in achievement.
INSEP asks the question: Could part of the cause of this disease be neural fatigue, that which is caused by overbrained labour?
This study was published in the journal Contemporary Biology.

According to Cui Aemin, the number of Chinese citizens "walking out" has increased dramatically over the past 70 years, from "less than a million per year" before the reform and opening up to more than a billion times a year today; at the same time, Chinese citizens travelling abroad are more secure and consular protection and assistance are extended from overseas Chinese nationals to various groups such as Chinese expatriates, tourists, students, and workers.
According to statistics, since the 18th anniversary of the party, our organization has conducted more than 10 major evacuations or transfers of Chinese citizens abroad, evacuating more than 40,000 Chinese citizens safely from dangerous and volatile areas.
• To receive and coordinate the handling of approximately 500,000 cases of various kinds of recourse, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, the country can take you home; it wants to have a "walk-and-go" trip, and it's not a dream anymore.
According to Choi Aemin, by the end of August of this year China had concluded visa-free agreements with 14 countries covering ordinary passport personnel.
In addition, an increasing number of countries have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens entry facilities such as visa waivers or landing visas.
Forty-two countries and territories, such as Thailand, Egypt, unilaterally granted entry visas to Chinese citizens with ordinary passports, and 15 other countries and territories, such as Indonesia, unilaterally granted exemption from entry to Chinese citizens with regular passports.
In addition to arrangements such as visa waivers, landings, etc., Chinese citizens are becoming easier to apply for visas and the formalities are becoming simpler.
By the end of August, China had concluded agreements or arrangements with 41 countries to simplify visa procedures.
These include reciprocal tourism with the United States, Canada, Israel, Argentina, the granting of multiple visas by business personnel for 10 years, reciprocal tourism with the United Kingdom, business, and multiple visa arrangements for two years by family visitors.
In the United Kingdom, Belgium jointly launched a "visa one-stop" service, and France, Italy and Singapore reduced the processing time for visas to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
The APEC Business Travel Card for frequent departures from the country, which enters the country multiple times, is a good option.
According to Choi Aemin, holding the travel card is equivalent to receiving multiple visas from 16 economies around Asia and the Pacific for five years, and is significant for business people, especially private business people, to "go out."
At present, China has the highest effective card holdings in the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote more countries to adopt visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, translate more of the results of diplomatic work into the Huimin Liang People ' s Initiative, and continuously increase the `gold content ' of Chinese passports.

. Jiangxi : "Little Chief" guard passenger line to operate safely.
The reporter was informed by the Jiangxi Department Road Transport Authority that to date, 1334 passenger routes have been "wire-long" in 11 of Jiangxi ' s established municipalities and 6 provincial direct-control counties.
The head of the Jiangxi Department Road Transport Administration explained that the security situation for road passengers was more serious because of the fact that part of the passenger enterprise was safely managed in a formal fashion, that the responsibility of the enterprise's safety agents was not fulfilled, that the passenger vehicles were over-speeded, and that the driver's fatigued driving was among other violations.
In order to further pressure road passenger enterprises on their primary responsibility for safe production and to guarantee the safety of passengers travelling by car, Jiangxi began piloting the " long line system " in 2017 and gradually replicating it throughout the province in 2018.
At present, 92 road passenger enterprises in Jiangxi have implemented the "wire-length" system, with 1334 lines for the selection of "wire-heads" to manage classes, covering 4824 passenger vehicles operating.
It was described that "wirelengths" were generally filled by designated personnel from the road transport passenger enterprise, specifically responsible for the management of the relevant lines, the car, the line, and so on, ensuring that the head of the line was in full control of the lines, vehicles, drivers, the operating environment, etc., and ensuring the safe operation of the line.

The journalists learned that on 26 October 2018, the Fukuzhou Central Branch of the People ' s Bank of China jointly signed a tripartite cooperation memorandum with the Tax Administration of Fujian Province, the General Directorate of State Tax Administration, and the China Silver Union Inc., to create a platform throughout the country that would benefit the building of the provincial tax bank, the Bank of the People ' s Republic of China.
After nearly a year of construction, the platform has now been successfully on the line.
The Chief of the Treasury Branch of the Fukuzhou Central Branch of the People ' s Bank of China, Wang Dehui, introduced the platform, which was based on the concept of building security, generality, convenience, compliance and leadership, front-end connections to taxes, government, banks, non-bank payment agencies and social services, the provision of mobile phones, micro-link public numbers, tax halls, bank outlets, inclusive financial services points, multiple online and down-line tax payment channels, back-end treasury, tax systems.
It is known that the platform brings together a number of welfare people's projects, in which urban and rural residents' health insurance payments are officially online.
The project opened 14 channels online and below, serving more than 30 million rural and urban residents of Fujian Province, covering 76% of the permanent resident population of Fujian Province.
On the line, health insurance can be paid through, for example, the "Close Tax Channel " " Cloud Flash " and the APP, Micro-Countain Public of various banks; under the line, health insurance can be paid in a variety of ways, including through scavengers, swing cards, brush cards, etc., to tax halls and rural inclusive financial services points in Fujian Province.
The Vice-President of the Fukuzhou Central Branch of the People ' s Bank of China, Taidong, said that the platform ' s success went online, while ensuring that government revenues were paid directly into the bank and data information was interactive in real time, and that it could provide a safe and efficient, multi-channel, multi-modal pay-and-pay service to the public at large.
At present, more than 16,000 inclusive financial services sites in the province have opened up the health insurance fee collection function, enabling rural residents to pay their health insurance "failure" and giving the public a growing sense of "access", "happiness " .
According to statistics, there have been 840,000 service users, 750,000 online and nearly 20,000 universal financial service point contributors, since 20 days of pilot operation in the run-up to the Platform ' s health insurance coverage project for urban and rural residents.
In addition, the deputy director of the Tax Department of Fujian Province of the National Tax Administration, Lim, revealed at the event that the platform was the country's first to apply the block chain electronic contribution voucher technology.
From the next month, the contributor can also download the stamped electronic contribution certificate directly via the mobile phone after completing the contribution.
The Fu-Jian tax information network, based on block chain technology, is being built and the "high-speed road" for private tax fees will be further widened.
The United States will deploy additional air defence systems and troops in Saudi Arabia
The U.S. Department of Defense announced on 26th that, as a result of the previous attack on Saudi oil facilities, the United States would deploy an additional "patriot" air defence system, four groups of "surveillance" radar systems and about 200 United States troops in Saudi Arabia.
The Pentagon said in a statement the same day that this deployment would enhance the air defence, anti-missile capabilities of key military objectives and civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and enhance the United States military presence in the area.
The statement also stated that U.S. Secretary of Defense Esper approved the inclusion of two "patriarch" air defence systems and a "Sad" anti-conductor system in the readiness deployment sequence at the same time.
Some U.S. defence media have questioned the effectiveness of this deployment, stating that the primary interception targets of the Patriots and Sade systems are not low-altitude targets such as U.S.-claimed drones and cruise missiles that attack Saudi Arabia.
In his address to the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly, President Rouhani of Iran said that Iran could help maintain "the security of the Persian Gulf" and ensure the smooth and safe passage of oil transport vessels through the Strait of Holmuz, provided that all countries had equal rights.
At the same time, he stressed that security in the area could be achieved only if the United States forces withdrew from the area.
This month, on 14th, several drones attacked two Saudi National Oil Company oil installations and caused a fire.
The U.S. side accused Iran of having created the attack and imposed new sanctions on Iran.
The Célis board president's increase plan was completed last year when he called for a staff increase of up to 43%.

After two months in detention by Iran, the British oil tanker "Stanner Empire" was finally released and departed from the Iranian port of Abbas in the morning of 27 to international waters.
And just last month, the British overseas territory of Gibraltar authorities just released an Iranian tanker that had been seized for more than a month.
According to the news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, at 9 a.m. local time, the British tanker "Stanner Empire" departed from the port of Abbas for the international waters of the Persian Gulf.
The Iranian Ports and Shipping Organization in Hormuzgan Province confirmed that the ship's commander and crew had made a formal and written commitment, and that although the ship had been seized, they did not have any claims.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In addition, vessel tracking data from Refinitiv found that the tanker began moving on 27 and left the port of Abbas.
This British-flagged stena Impero tanker was seized by Iran in July this year.
The company's spokesman said the tanker was preparing to leave the port of Abbas.
. Two weeks after the British seized an Iranian tanker in the waters of Gibraltar, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker, called Stena Impero, on the Holmuz Channel channel.
The ship was released in August.
earlier this week, Iranian government spokesmen said that all the legal procedures required for the release of the "Stanner Empire" had been completed.
The Iranian side said, however, that the investigation was still under way.
A number of Iranian media have also released videos of the tanker's departure.
On 19 July, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy detained a British tanker, the "Stannah Empire", in Iranian waters in the Strait of Holmuz, before escorting it to the port of Abbas.
The Iranians were taken from the waters of Gibraltar by the tanker Grace One.
In addition, on 4 July, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory seized the "Grace I" tanker carrying Iranian crude oil in the Strait of Gibraltar on suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions.
more than a month later, on 15 August, the Gibraltar authorities announced the release of Grace I.
This afternoon, a special session on the subject of educational review and rehabilitation at undergraduate colleges and universities across the province was held in Changsha.
The Vice-Secretary of the Provincial Council, Ulan, stressed the need to improve political standing, strengthen political responsibility, review and overhaul issues from the point of view, and promote high-quality development in higher education, political thinking and reform with the effectiveness of thematic education.

"One-on-one" two very high-pressure projects.
On 26th, the para-east to the ± 1100 kV direct transmission project, the Sutung 1000 kV exchange special high-pressure GIL complex project was shipped.
Both projects occupy high-points in the respective areas of current world power transmission technology, and will allow for a substantial increase in the country's energy-intensive optimal configuration after delivery.
The General Economist of the National Energy Authority, Guo Ji, said that the para-dong to Zhongnan projects were the world's largest power delivery and the most distant transmission projects.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The GIL, the gas-insulated metal, shuts down the transmission line.
The Sutong pipeline project, which created a record of the highest level of voltage and the strongest delivery capacity in the world for the GIL project, achieved the ‘exchange two-cycling network' of the highest level of voltage in the Chinese backbone grid.
According to the National Electricity Network Company, the distance of power transmission from the para-east to the Zhongnan Project is 3324 km.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15 per cent of electrical energy will be lost in transit, and the project has been closed for research and development, raising the economic delivery distance significantly to more than 3,000 kilometres.
Upon the launch of the para-east to Zhongnan project, 100 million degrees of electrical energy can be delivered every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help break down the new energy available in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, this line alone will reach 60 to 85 billion kWh per year to satisfy more than half of Shanghai's electricity use throughout the year.
The SutungGIL Integrated Pipeline Project is a controlled project across the Yangtze River by a high-pressure communication ring network.
If conventional air lines are to be used to cross the river, two giant iron towers exceeding 450 metres will need to be erected on the Yangtze River side and an artificial island of over four football field sizes will be built for each tower.
In response, the national electricity grid was boldly innovative in developing compact, high-pressure exchange GIL transmission technology, which crossed the river from water through tunnels, avoiding effects on the gold course.
Two projects contributed to a new leap in our electrician equipment manufacturing capacity.
At present, the national grid has built up "10 to 11 straight" high-pressure projects, and "4 to 3 straight" is under construction.
Foreign exchange bureau: our external debt structure continues to optimize.
" In general, our external debt structure continues to optimize and the stability of our external debt has increased ... "
The news spokesman of the National Foreign Exchange Administration, Wang Chunying, stated on 27 February that the main indicators of our external debt were within internationally recognized security lines and that external debt risks were generally manageable.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The data show that, as of the end of June 2019, our total-caliber (including foreign currency) external debt balance was US$ 19980 billion, an increase of $26.3 billion over the end of March 2019, an increase of 1.3 per cent, mainly due to the increase in debt securities balances.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 per cent of the increase in our full-calibre external debt was driven by non-residents buying domestic yuan bonds, and the non-residents were dominated by medium- and long-term investors such as central banks.
In late June 2019, the share of medium-term and long-term external debt rose by 3 percentage points compared to the end of March 2019, and the share of domestic currency external debt rose by 1 percentage point compared to the end of March 2019.
According to Wang Chun Ying, with the inclusion of the yuan bond in our country in the Bloomberglay Global Aggregate Index in April 2019, the international investor's recognition of the Chinese bond market has been further increased, with a sustained increase in the holdings of the yuan bond in our country.
" Our balance of payments is generally balanced and external debt risks are manageable ... "
The reporter learned from the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences that the Yunnan meadow moths are currently effectively protected, without causing widespread outbreaks, and that the prevention and control work has achieved milestones.
This year, for the first time in Jiangcheng County, Yunnan Pu Mae, a moth moving from outside the country was discovered and subsequently confirmed in 129 counties in Yunnan, where it spread gradually from Yunnan to the Mainland China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.
The meadow moth is an important agricultural pest originating in the tropics and subtropical regions of the Americas, and is a major ejective pest of the United Nations FAO global warning, characterized by "internationality, evaporation, suddenness, destructiveness".
The pest endangers more than 80 crops, such as maize, sugar cane, sorghum, and takes large amounts of food, causing up to 70 per cent of production losses.
It is difficult to combat it, and China does not have registered pesticides to combat it.
Since the meadow moths moved into Yunnan, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences has chosen to send a researcher, Aethon, to lead the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences in agricultural cross-border harmful organisms, in collaboration with the Green Control Provincial Innovation Team, to travel to a line, field investigations, sample collection, and to conduct technical guidance and pilot demonstrations.

Their active research and application of green-control technologies, the implementation of new green-control technologies, such as population monitoring, insect trapping, scientific use and agronomic measures, have achieved more than 90 per cent of the prevention and control effects in the demonstration areas, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural enemy resources and the ecological environment, and providing technical safeguards for Yunnan to effectively control the eruption of grassland night moths and sustainable governance.
At present, the Yunnan meadow moths are effectively protected and have not caused large-scale outbreaks, and the prevention and control work has achieved milestones.
In the next step, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on the ecological mechanisms of population migration to invade the outbreak, breaking through biological control and the construction of the Green Control Technology System.
At the same time, international cross-border cooperation has been actively promoted with a view to establishing joint priority laboratories and joint monitoring networks and demonstration areas outside the country to enhance the full range of surveillance and early warning capabilities of Yunnan meadows.

White Paper: China ' s way out of a country-specific development path
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The White Paper states that for 70 years, the Chinese people have been struggling to explore and move forward, successfully opening the path of China's distinctive socialistism and achieving notable development achievements worldwide.
The White Paper says that China ' s development is based on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development is based on a genuine spirit of "800 million shirts for a Boeing" — in which generations of people marched and struggled, paying the unimaginable hard work and sweat; on the "self-carrying" of others, whether in good or in adversity, not to export problems, not to turn to contradictions, not to plunder other countries for their own development through strong buying and selling; and on the exploration of the "spreading of stones across the river", not imperialism, colonialism old ways, not to take the Western model of development, but to combine China's actual, lessons learned, drawing on human civilization, and dare to break into one's own path.
The White Paper states that China has developed in its association interaction with the world, that China has injected positive energy into world peace and development, and that China's roads are in line with Chinese national conditions and are adapted to the demands of the times.
China maintains world peace with practical action.
For 70 years, China has not initiated any war or conflict on its own initiative and has not appropriated one inch of other countries' land.
The White Paper states that the fundamental reason for the great success of China ' s development over the past 70 years is to find the correct path of China ' s special socialism and to follow it firmly.
This is a path to be established in the national context, to put the interests of the people first, to reform and innovate, to pursue common development in openness, and to fully adhere to the rule of law.
In China, which is large, complex, difficult to govern, without centralized unity and strong leadership, China will move towards division and disintegration, with catastrophic consequences for the world.
The White Paper says that, over the past 70 years, China has overcome various risks and challenges, creating yet another remarkable Chinese miracle.
In particular, since the eighteenth Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, China has achieved historic achievements in development, with historic changes, and the Chinese nation has come to a great leap from standing up, becoming rich to being strong, closer than ever before to the great goal of national revival.
This path to development in China will show brighter prospects for development as the times move forward.

The first high-rise building in northern China, Tianjin Zhou Dafu, was completed, resulting in over 100 national patents.
The completion of the Tianjin Zhou Dafu Finance Centre in the first high-rise building in northern China, on the afternoon of 26, took place in the New Zone of Tianjin, marking the success of the building information model, which was independently developed by the project department of the Tianjin Zhou Dafu Finance Centre in China and won the global award for excellence in the global engineering construction industry – a coordinated management platform for the high-accuracy BIM model in the area of skyscraper construction.
The Tianjin Zhou Dafu Financial Center is located within the Tianjin City Economic Technology Development Area, with a total construction area of 390,000 square metres, 4 underground floors, 100 above ground floors, and 530 metres in height, covering level A offices, luxury apartments, over five star hotels, and so on, and will become an important part of Tianjin's Internationalized Landmark complex.
The relevant head of the project at Tianjin Zhou Dafu Financial Center in China introduced the project as having a total of over 70,000 tons of steel, a high altitude group of about 376,000 metres of welding equivalent to 42.5 Everest heights, the use of welds around 40 laps of Earth, a total of 42,000 steel components, and more than 50 per cent of non-labeled components, which included the two-barrel elliptical transverse steel poles with the world's most single-layered distortion angle of 90 degrees.
The complexity and processing difficulty of the steel structure of the Tianjin Zhou Dafu project are unprecedented.
According to industry sources, Tianjin Zhou Dafu Financial Center has taken the lead in implementing all aspects of building information model (BIM) management in built or built skyscrapers throughout the country.
The creative introduction and successful implementation of full-time participation, full-service applications, and the implementation of a "three-to-one BIM application" model throughout the process developed a platform for synergistic management based on a high-precision BIM model.
The head said that during the construction of Dafu in Zhou, the project department first undertook BIM construction in the virtual world and then carried out physical work after scientific validation, thereby disassembling what might have been done during construction work and eliminating back-to-work problems in the bud.
In 2017, the BIM innovation results of the Zhou Dafu Financial Center project won the first award of the Global Award for Excellence in Engineering and Construction at the Global AU Masters Group and the 2017 Global Award for Excellence in Engineering and Construction.
In the course of construction of the project, the project department created more than 130 national patent results.
It is worth mentioning that the BIM innovation and science and technology innovation of the Tianjin Zhou Dafu project have not only made all of the complex and numerous construction phases a success, but have also led to significant improvements in security management, among others, by shortening the construction period by more than four months.
A short time ago, the Tianjin Zhou Dafu Financial Center project also won the 2019 ISA International Security Award.

The Iranian Defence Minister Amir Khatami expressed his opposition to any agreement with the West on the Iranian missile project.
The Islamic Republic of Iran news agency quoted Khatami as saying that any agreement with the United States on Iran's "missile forces" would undermine Iraq's capabilities.
According to Khatami, Iranian leaders all support the improvement of the missile project.
The agreement between Iran and the six countries on the Iranian nuclear issue was reached in 2015, and the United States withdrew from this agreement and resumed and intensified sanctions against Iraq last May, attempting to use the oppression of the limits to allow Iran and the United States to renegotiate the Iran nuclear agreement in order to limit Iran ' s weapons projects and regional activities.
A number of Western leaders used the United Nations General Assembly occasion to use their good offices to mediate US-Iraq tensions.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French President, Emmanuel Markron, met on the margins of the General Assembly.
Following the meeting of the leaders of the three countries, a joint statement was issued urging Iran to engage in dialogue on nuclear activities, missile projects and regional security issues.
The President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, told media reporters on 24 December that Iran was willing to discuss the Iran nuclear agreement "small changes, additions or amendments " , provided that the United States lifts the sanctions.

New regulations for consultation: Qualification of social capital for rural land management
Qualification of social capital for rural land management
Public consultation on the Rural Land Management Scheme to regulate the transfer of social capital flows, such as business enterprises, to land management
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website published a notice of public consultation on the " Rural Land Management Scheme (revised draft for consultation) " (hereinafter referred to as the " opinion draft " ), which increased the regulation and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital flows, such as business enterprises, to land management.
The draft of the opinion is open to public comment from this day on.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs stated that, in order to implement the newly revised Rural Land Contracting Act, to further consolidate and improve the rural basic business system, to deepen the reform of the rural land system, and to implement the "triple power-sharing" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the "Rural Land Contracting Authority Transfer Management Scheme" to form the "Standard of Opinions " .
The Beijing Youth Journal reporter learned that the first published "opinion draft" had several important changes.
The newly revised Rural Land Contracting Act clearly defines the range of land flows and implements the concept of the "tribution of rights", with separate sections on "contracting rights to land" and "land management rights " , making a clear distinction between land contracting rights transfers, swaps and land management rights transfers (rents, transfers, shares or other means).
In this draft of the Opinion, in order to implement the concept of "tribution of rights", to effectively respond to the main thrust of the reform of the Law on Rural Land Contracting, and to take into account the fact that there are significant differences in the transfer of rights to land and the interchange of rights to land contracting, as well as in terms of parties, procedures, regulation, etc., this revision defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on the transfer of rights to land, the means of transfer, including rental, equity, etc., and to change the name of the regulation from "The transfer of rights to rural land" to "The transfer of rights to rural land " .
For the transfer of land contracting rights, swaps will be regulated in a separate way.
The Draft of the Opinion states that in the context of the "triple power division", farmers are only entitled to land for a certain period of time.
Theoretically, even in the event of bankruptcy, farmers risk losing their business rights for a certain period of time, and thus providing for contractual return to the original contractor is no longer legally necessary and is in conflict with the "insolvency law".
In response to the issue of protection against the risk of land loss by farmers, methods such as priority shares, rentals, buybacks, etc. have been created in practice.
Considering that priority shares already have a more mature theoretical exploration of corporate law, it is recommended to be used as an advocacy provision to protect against the risk of stock loss.
