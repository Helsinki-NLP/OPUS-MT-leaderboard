The temporary suspension last week of the ancient play Beauty's Private Room Cuisine, unexpectedly triggered a live discussion about the fakeness of the national production ratings.
Civil rights groups issued a travel warning for Missouri.
As a result of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued a travel warning to colored people preparing to travel to Missouri.
The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which came into force on August 28, 2017, called for special attention and extreme caution when all African American travellers, tourists and Missouriers traveled in Missouri, as a result of the recent series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri, and advised that "the group's statement claimed.
The NAACP notes that a recently adopted Missouri law makes it more difficult to win discrimination lawsuits and that law enforcement in the state is, to some extent, directed at minority groups, a phenomenon that prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
The violation of citizens' rights is happening to people.
They were questioned, beaten or killed for skin color, "Missouri NAACP chairman Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
"We have received many complaints in unprecedented numbers. "
This was the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The organization cited racial defamation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black male Tolly Sanders in Tennessee.
This year, Saunders died in suspicious circumstances. He ran out of fuel while travelling in Missouri, and was detained by Missouri police without charges of crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that "black drivers in the state are 75% more likely than whites to be checked for parking."
"The purpose of the consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . people need to be prepared, whether to carry bail to Missouri, or to let relatives know that they are travelling within the state."
. According to the latest data from the FBI Hate Crimes Report, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; the state ranked 16th nationally, according to the number of crimes.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which will make it more difficult to prosecute businesses that discriminate against housing or employment.
Previously, U.S. states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration offenders, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that this would increase the number of race lawsuits and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona.
The travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but recently, the advisory group has taken this approach to address certain laws and trends in the United States.
The overall film market entered a period of calm in 2016 after the "Golden Age" of the sharp increase in the box office in 2015, and was able to reach a suspense of the total box office results of $44,069 million last year.
According to data published by the National Statistics Office, in October the prices of new and second-hand houses in Beijing were both cooled and the ring was only 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent higher.
The current UEFA Chief Technical Officer, Lupescu, made a technical report on the 2016 Euro Championships and the European Championships last season at the Conference.
The BBC called Beijing the most exciting city: to make the foreigners feel "living in a new era."
The reference network reported on January 18 that Beijing may have a long history of three thousand years, but it is also rapidly becoming the modern charismatic city of today.
The Chinese capital has an alarmingly high Internet, with sophisticated technologies such as face recognition software, a huge investment in artificial intelligence and an unparalleled internationalization of energy, one of the most exciting cities for foreigners rich in exploration.
According to the BBC website, on January 16, German expatriate Clemens Sesch said, "If I can succeed there, I can do it anywhere in the future." He cited singer Frank Sinatra singing the lyrics of New York City.
"If Sinatra survives to this day, he will probably sing cities like Beijing." "He says that living in this city will make you feel "living in a new era" and always keep up with the tide.
The old home is in England, but recently Simon Norton, who lives in Beijing, has published an article on the personal blog website 4Corners7Seas, saying, "People generally have a feeling of being at the centre of something huge, which is hard to say, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time... they want to see what it's going to look like and want to see for themselves. "
The report states that the high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment in this city make daily life easier than ever.
From Manila, Andy Peña Fuelt, currently deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children's website, said, "Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cash-free society, and the Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones to make it easier for everyone to carry out many transactions. "
The report says, but smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambition, and facial recognition software has become widely available, and many mobile phone applications use this technology to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of the Cybercar driver.
. Beijing also recently announced plans to spend RMB 13.8 billion to build an artificial intelligent technology park, where more than 400 businesses will be settled, which will focus on the development of various artificial intelligence technologies from bioassay to autopilot cars.
. Food is also at the core of many major festivals in China throughout the years, and participation in these celebrations is admired by foreigners, who are the most important social and economic festivals and one of the most easily accessible for foreigners.
"I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, cleaning their apartments and the red Spring United with a New Year's blessing on their home doorposts are equally important. On New Year's Eve, all family members must have a great meal together, then stay up until midnight and greet the New Year with a loud fire. ... For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity to integrate."
According to reports, the number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but Chinese language barriers and the ease of communication between expatriates can easily serve as an excuse for their incomplete integration into local culture.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but have little experience with their host countries. . . . . . . . . if your initial attempts to contact the Chinese were not successful, then it would be easy for you to have or be easier to get along with other foreigners.
"In these so-called "old-out bubbles" ("old-out bubbles" refers to foreigners who only mix among foreigners, without contact with local people and local culture - translator notes), foreigners who hold themselves in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only foreigners among friends.
The simplest way to overcome this is to learn a bit of Mandarin — it's easier than one might imagine.
And Seshi said, "The Chinese private tutorial of one or two hours a week, or the learning of the introductory level, should fit everyone's busy schedule. "
Even learning a few classic short sentences can help with shopping, ordering meals in restaurants or chatting in taxis.
According to reports, persistent air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, although in recent years the government has tried to contain some problems.

The European Commission considers this to be detrimental to consumers' interests and hinders competition.

The global digital currency, led by Bitcoin, has been baptized since this week, with regulatory storms in major markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union falling by $10,000 integer on Tuesday and by the largest single-day fall in three years.
In addition to the price reversals naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the sharp fall in the digital currency of this round is not unrelated to the "host enemy" that has always been — regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the visualized big data site, HowMuch.net, produced a chart showing the legitimacy and the level of regulation of Bitcoin in countries around the globe.
The following figure shows that green represents the legitimate market for Bitcoin; orange yellow represents the neutral market, which has not publicly legalized Bitcoin status, but there are no major restrictions on its use; light pink represents restricted markets, where local governments attempt to use digital currency through redline policy or regulation; dark pink represents Bitcoin is defined as an illegal country; grey is an unrated country.
(The above figure is from HowMuch.Net visualization team charted on January 15)
The article notes that, as can be seen from the color distribution of the Central African greens, the attitude of Eastern countries in the traditional sense of the word bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West.
Russia is currently the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries to have no comment on Bitcoin and no relevant policies have yet been put in place.
. North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bitcoin, i.e., the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America with respect to the bitcoin show a marked differentiation, with a more mixed distribution of the colours in the above-mentioned regions.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are legal bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, etc. have some degree of restrictions on their trade and use, and more Latin American countries have not spoken of bitcoin.
A synthesis of the above-mentioned data is known to indicate that out of the 246 countries that are globally accounted for, a total of 99 (or 40 per cent) have no restrictions on trade in and use of coins, i.e. green and orange-yellow areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) are restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4 per cent) define bitcoin as illegal (deep pink), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) do not have more treatment for digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that the countries that make up the global majority (53%, more than half) are still watching the legitimacy of the digital currency headed by Bitcoin within their borders and represent the "BlackSwan Risk" of Bitcoin, as some of them may eventually make legislative decisions to limit the digital currency.
The article argues that global regulators do not fully understand the emerging category of digital currency and may be the main reason that most countries have not yet made a statement.
Although Bitcoin's "human spirit" has grown exponentially since last year, it does not represent the interest of all countries, and it may be that some countries fear that local French currency will be threatened as a result, or that digital money will be used by criminal organizations.
The Wall Street News has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China's start to strike off off-site exchanges' centralized service online platforms and mobile Apps, and South Korea is still considering closing the digital currency exchange, which the EU believes has not been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of "rewarding to death".

Quite a bit of criticism of Bitcoin's legitimacy, such as that of Russia, is actually also intended to give way to the official issuance of digital currency.

What else is sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most definite sign of the regime change was when they began attacking the statue.
The Americans, like anyone else, agree with this. So, Saddam Hussein was carefully pushed down at Paradise Square in Baghdad in 2003.
As one of the key think tanks of the Trump administration, Jim Acosta, on the President's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration, must have known what would happen when he had to cut off a symbolic axe of the Statue of Liberty.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially in 1903 when Emma Lazarus' famous poems were carved on the base (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller rebukes Acosta, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is like the symbol of America's freedom to illuminate the world...
The poem you're referring to, which was added later, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
In fact, Miller was right, but, as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This involves modern echoes of Lazarus's horrifying language, and the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowd of people eager to breathe freely, / The suffering people reject your crowded beach."
There is no "suffering man who refuses" at a time when our screens are becoming more glamorous.
. Miller did not work on literary reviews, and he made it clear that these people would not be welcome in the United States during the Trump era.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is in fact a conflict with the American spirit.

The purpose of the sculpture is to express the link between French and American republicanism through the feminine incarnation of the Statue of Liberty, the ancient classic metaphor.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in her poem
She gave herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The combination of this poem and this painting is a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American nativeism.
Like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker Rush Limbaugh, an interim baptist from Trump, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and that he was now an early neo-conservative who brought the intellectual flames of America to the world of ignorance: "The Lady of Liberty is bold.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The torch is not the path that illuminates America. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The significance of the statue depends entirely on the point of view of perception.
The very imaginative approach of Lazarus is to be able to see it when the tired, poor, but hopeful will be able to see it on the ship deck after a long and often terrible journey.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Her statue conveys to them and needs the hope and welcome they hear.
Of course, this is not the point Miller and Trump had wanted to admit.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . not to illuminate the road, but to ignite the hatred of their only source of power.

Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand the voters' blame.
Our father knows the style of bad media.
The Americans loved Washington, but soon afterwards, the major newspapers began to slam everything on him, from domestic policy to political principles, not one left behind.
He's pissed off at these criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn't silence the critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech is denied — we will be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance."
This reminds me of Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland, who needs to learn from Washington.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him in this regard earlier this week.
The governor's staff considered the lawsuit to be very hasty, and the online coverage was full of their strong opposition: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
It's particularly important because it's people like Hogan.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Among the 50 governors in the country, he received second place in the rankings.
Hogan's not a reactionary impatient.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . he was also very good at using Facebook as the main way to communicate his feelings with the electorate, with the dramatic display of his post-chemistry baldness for the first time on his home page.
So it's completely unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous, to block people coming to the governor's home page review. This home page is a public forum that is the official management platform for public tax-supporting staff.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Shass, defended the governor's actions by saying that she believed that blocking their comments was just trying to get them to restrain.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Washington Post has spoken face-to-face with people who have been shielded by Hogan.
They're just ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: their identities are teachers, small business owners and priests, not some flood beast.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The priest quoted the words of the Bible in his post, calling Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Questions about hate crimes were asked by the barrister Lakhimi Salma Ramani of Bowy, Maryland, who was not cynical.
In the news story review section of the Washington Post, she wrote, "I am politely commenting that I am disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news stories.
I also do not like a group of people who comment on the same topic, because they are directly ignored by some as being so-called absconding psychology, rather than treating them as citizens of a group of worried people. "
The "intensive garbage message bombing" called by the governor's staff may seem to others to be a "continuation of claims".
The Facebook era made it easy to modify a message, only to block a critic or remove a negative comment.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . and cleared far more clean than in the past, the same effect was required in the past years to send staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical remarks or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that's what's happening right now, just at the digital level.
. . . . . . . . Hogan was not the first public official to be blamed for squealing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users because he blocked them on Twitter.

The number of news newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and there were people writing anonymous letters strongly criticizing his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington had an anonymous flood beast against him.
. People use pseudonyms such as Yurikla, Valerius, Belizalu, and Podius to write to the press to severely criticize Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington Newspapers online project, his office was flooded by a petition, all criticizing his attitude on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, signed with the United Kingdom.
But he didn't squeal at them.
The freedom of expression, the freedom of dissent and the freedom of speech are the foundations of this country.

According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in the Papuan tribal highlands in the 1970s have escalated into genocide.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year alone.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane "We'll Lose Everything" encompassed proof of the most heinous acts of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — another reported particularly widespread rape and electrocution — and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
Human Rights Watch Indonesian researcher Andreas Harsono said that "[t]he violence occurs every day, and therefore it is difficult to calculate the number of victims. "

In the province, 83 per cent of the 3.5 million people are Christians, but the demographic structure of the Muslim economy has changed since the arrival of immigrants from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
The Javanese snack stand sells fried chickens and vegetables mixed with more and more, with peanut butter.
The locals fought hard.
The 24-year-old Paniae native, Apos Yu, moved to Chaiapura, the provincial capital, to find work, explaining that "those immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans.
This has caused the local Papuans — the women of Papua (mama-mama) — to lose their market. "
The President of Indonesia, Zoko Widodo (often referred to as Zokovi), vowed at his 2014 campaign to address Papuan inequality and abuse of power.
The former carpenter's road to Jakarta's presidential palace was supported by 27 of the 29 districts — including Paniay.
But Papua didn't change anything, and today, the locals feel betrayed.
And Yu said, "We've broken our heart, and in 2014 we voted for Zokovi, hoping that he will fulfil our wishes and restore justice."
In fact, just two months after Zokovi took office in October, Pania suffered the worst nightmare.
On 7 December 2014, Enarotali 11 children sang a Christmas hymn in front of the bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers rushed over on motorcycles.
The scared kids told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local priest Yavet Tebay, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses claim that these drunk soldiers followed the children with their guns.
One of the soldiers then shot the children.
The 16-year-old Julianus Yemmer was in a coma due to severe beatings.
A few hours later, a large fire broke out in the nearby government agency's Election Commission building, and the next day the incident escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuans men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of local police stations and military command centres to demand justice.

The 56-year-old Jeremias Kayamu was the head of the Enarotali Kego Koto neighborhood, who felt that there was an imminent danger, called for the crowd to calm down and begged them to come home.
But nobody's in the mood to hear him say it.
He stood on the porch of his colorful cabin and told Time magazine that when I came back, my left wrist was suddenly shot. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He added, "It was crowded, and they fired a lot of shots."

It's a matter of life and death. "
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
The next day's news about the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta.
three weeks later, Zokovi gave a vocal and morbid speech in Chayapura, expressing deep sympathy for the victims ' families and vowing to address the legacy of abuse of power in Papuan history.
He said, "I hope this case will be resolved as soon as possible so that it will not happen again in the future."
. . . . . . . . . . . in October, Minister of Security Verando stated that he was to establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuses for the push-off almost went off right away.
He said, "Most of the violations took place a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The focus is on our commitment to address these violations, but this will require a process as well. "
And then on June 5 in Jakarta, when Vilando spoke to Time magazine, he said he had no plans to establish a complaints mechanism in Papua.
On the contrary, he said, "everything will be resolved by law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Vilando for "crimes against human rights" in the 1999 bloody independent ballot in East Timor, but he says that 11 human rights violations have been resolved in the Papua area, including the Pania.
The families of the victims of the Pania incident were scornful of these statements.
I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's no progress at all. "
Years later, he said, "I'm tired."
He's still living in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army. I'm afraid of being shot. "
His brother Yukabus also believed that the people of Pania were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said, "After burying the body, the military came to me."
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deyay County, a neighbouring district of Paniai.
The manager of a construction company refused to help transport a unconscious man to the hospital, where there was conflict between the two sides, where one person died and 17 others were injured, among them children.
The 24-year-old man, Lavyanus Dowu, drowned while fishing on the nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's live office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so they fired a warning.
But the rioting mobile force (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, and one man was killed.
29 The old Domin Valley Buddy told Time magazine that "we were all panicking and now afraid they'd retaliate." "He lived near the hospital, when he witnessed the wounded being rushed into the hospital.
"I've been hiding at home for two days. "
The Deyay Parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the rioting mobile forces to be withdrawn from the area.

The lack of effective development breeds discontent among the people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which are scattered in the central highlands of Panie onion.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army claiming to protect the rights of the Papuans through scattered attacks and raids to abduct Indonesian soldiers.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As a result, thousands of Paniai have been arrested by the military in recent years under the guise of "maintenance of national sovereignty" and intentionally detained.
Some people never show up again.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in the eyes of the Papuans, Pania is a "forgotten place of tragedy."
Poverty breeds disaffection.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The bread is so far away.
The people here grow everything they can eat: mainly potatoes and some fruits and leaves and vegetables.
The farming is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five potatoes.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Ten pieces of potatoes are worth 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has been pulled away from local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of the new route to the airport of Nabire.
The small amount of work available is usually in the hands of better educated and richer immigrants.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
John Gobay, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council, said, "Young people don't want to stay in this village... because there's no work and no money here. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lonshan were expelled from Papua because they "did not cooperate with the agencies concerned", even though they had rare access to the filming authorization.
According to the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch for Asia, Felim Kane, the election vow of Zokovi to lift the reporting restrictions for transparency and development was not fulfilled.
In a statement, he said that "if foreign journalists try to report on Papua and West Papua, the easternmost provinces of Indonesia, they are at new risk: denying visas and pulling into blacklists. "
The absence of media monitoring means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to neighboring Papuan countries.
In March, six Pacific countries — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's "all types of widespread human rights violations", including the Panai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua movement.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Almanata Nasir, who did not care about the allegations made against the group, told journalists in Jakarta that " Indonesia is still practising democratic institutions and media freedom, so it is difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations. "
The locals want more foreign governments to pay attention.
According to an informed source, on 4 May, when the Dutch human rights ambassador, Keith Van Barr, led a delegation of officials to Chaiapura, the local people broke their silence and begged for "we want freedom." "He also attended that meeting, but asked for anonymity.
The next presidential election will be held in Indonesia in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote in Zokovi again.
The Chairman of the Tribal Council, Gobai, said that "Zokovi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people who were involved in the Paniai shooting. "
He wanted Zokovi to know that the Pania people were not only living under the threat of a greedy army, but had nothing in the area, where education was scarce and public health services were lacking.

He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic protest: burying a victim's body across from that military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
Yuchabus, who was lying down, said, "My family was killed, and my family was killed.
What else can we do?"
. On February 10, 2017, the Chinese Securities Commission approved the initial application of the Guangdong Mansion House Co., Inc. to issue a small board listing pass at the Deep Dealer House, after more than 20 days of European homes had just been approved by the IPO.
The industry believes that, as a result of the match, the Europa home was followed by a market, and that the custom home area, which had originally been at the windfall, would shift from product competition to capital competition.
The news of the impending listing of a typical branded shop house in the custom home area at the beginning of the new year, when the Queen's Home was first released, attracted the attention of the entire home industry.

The fire again engulfed Dubai Torch skyscrapers.
On Friday, a fire broke out in one of the highest residential buildings in the world in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from this 337-metre-high, 79-story super-high building.
This was the second fire in just two years to sweep the high-rise building, which happened to be the skyscraper known as the Torch.
The building has been evacuated and no injuries have been reported and the cause of the fire has not yet been found.
"We were sleeping, and then we were woken up by fire, and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs, running down from 50 floors for about 10 minutes, "A resident named George told Reuters.
The civil defence authorities in Dubai stated that the fire brigade had extinguished the fire around 0000 local time (Greenwich Standard Time 0000) and was in the process of cooling down the building.
The Government has indicated that efforts are being made to provide safe havens for affected persons.
This accident may once again raise concerns around the world about the safety of outer wall materials used in high-rise buildings.
A survey conducted by the fire management of the Torch skyscrapers after their 2015 fire found that most of the damaged objects were overhead walls used for decoration and insulation.
The British police have stated that they believe that the problem with the insulation and overlay panel system in the Glenfer building in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire, which killed about 80 people.

A month after the opening of the Olympic Games in Pingchang, South Korea, on 9 January, the atmosphere in South Korea is growing as the Olympic holy fire transmits preheat from south to north and preparations are so intense.
South Korean public opinion looks forward to this long-running inter-Korean talks, which will bring a "coloured egg" to the countdown of the Pingchang Winter Olympics for a month.
On November 1, last year, Pingchang Winter Olympics fire arrived in South Korea.

According to Korean media reports, as of 3 January, the Pingchang Winter Olympics ticket sales had reached 64 per cent, and the Winter Paralympics ticket sales had surpassed 50 per cent.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to the Korean Tournament, the Korean Ministry of Justice announced on the 8th day that the stay in Korea would be extended for up to 120 days for foreigners visiting the Pingchang Winter Olympics.
The investigation found that more than a fifth of American travellers boarded with prohibited items.
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had deliberately or unintentionally carried illegal items through the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority checkpoint, of which at least 6 per cent had inadvertently carried prohibited knives or other blades.
Less than 1% of passengers declared that they only found afterward miscarrying firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The investigation, which targeted over 1,000 people, was conducted by charter services, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., and found that young travellers were more likely to ignore regulations openly.
Of the respondents who admitted having attempted to deliberately carry TSA prohibited items on board, 19.7 per cent were from the millennium generation, compared to less than 15 per cent from the X generation.
The most common items that deliberately slip past TSA inspectors are food and beverages.
More than 3% of the respondents admitted to having intentionally carried a blade through the security check, while 2.2% of the female respondents and 3.7% of the male respondents also stated that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs on board.
The company stated that the purpose of the investigation was to find out the number of people who had accidentally carried and deliberately carried embargoed goods past the aircraft's security boarding.
It is no surprise that those who are most likely to carry embargoed items over security — intentionally or unintentionally — are those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA Guide is a little complicated to understand.
People are usually not sure what liquid they can carry and how much.
It's not surprising, therefore, that the TSA has seized the most illegal liquid.
At one time, it was thought that the TSA might have treated the book as an embargoed object.
The domestic flight is allowed to carry liquids, but the international flight is not allowed to carry.
U.S. Environmental Protection Director Prutt changed his mind about the Obama-era mitigation regulations.
One day after being sued by 15 states, the Director of Environmental Protection, Scott Prout, changed his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama-era provisions to reduce emissions of smog air pollutants.

He did not mention the legal challenges brought by the Federal Court of Appeal against his predecessor's position.
The focus of the controversy was to set October 1 as the deadline for the states to begin to meet the 2015 ground ozone standard.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay the implementation for a year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid "disturbing local decision-making or hindering economic growth".
Before being appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was the Attorney General of Oklahoma, long opposed to the strictification of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned to regulations that prevent or delay opposition from the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden reversal on Wednesday was one of the most recent legal obstacles to Prut regulation's return to the agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Director of Environmental Protection exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's requirement for oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane spills.
In a statement released on Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed a major turn in his attitude towards ozone standards, saying that he would strengthen the commitment of the Environmental Protection Agency to work with the states to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
. . . . . . . . . . under the previous government administration, EPA usually falls short of the specified deadline, then waits for radical groups and others to sue and agree to set the designated timetable through an agreement. . . . . . . he has initiated more than a dozen prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the regulations and the authorities seriously. "
In spite of this, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may again use his "extended authorization and all other legally available authorization" to ensure that the provisions are in line with "good policies and the best information available".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wide rewriting of the ozone layer regulations.
The House Bill approved last month was intended to postpone the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
The New York State Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, led the state coalition to sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this week, saying that it intended to maintain legal pressure.
And Schneiderman said, "The reverse of the U.S. EPA – after we filed a lawsuit – is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with over 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke emissions. "
c) California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and Washington, D.C. joined the New York State ranks in this case.
The ground ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants emitted by automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources in sunlight exposures in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke causes serious respiratory problems for sensitive populations, resulting in thousands of premature deaths each year.
of course, public health advocates and environmentalists are cheering for the surprising transformation of Pruitt.
And Lori Ann Byrd of the Biodiversity Centre said, "It's disturbing that this common sense measure is under great pressure from the heads of the departments that protect the air we need to breathe. "
" We must fight the Trump Government ' s ideological movement to cater to polluters and special interest groups ... "

According to leaked phone records, Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall at the border.
The Washington Post leaked a record of conversations between United States President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, during a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.

Moore Beach Tragedy: Activists Re-emerge racist lynchings and Justice
A Ford Mercury car in 1948 ran through a group of surroundings in Monroe, Georgia, heading towards a small Moor Beach bridge.
The car contained four black passengers and a white driver, and before the car arrived at the bridge, a group of white men with guns marched forward, blocking the way the car went forward.
The mob's boss - a middle-aged man in a fine striped suit - takes a deep sip of cigars and eyes into the windshield.
The passengers in the car are full of fear.
"We want - Roger!" the man shouted.
"Tow him out of the car!"
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Fortunately, July 22, this terrible scene is just a repeat.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . when Roger's neck was
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore Beach Bridge, reproducing two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Merey Dosey - the scene of the night of their hanging by the three K parties in 1946.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
. . . . . . . . . . . . while we know who they are, and even though we have seen them in the community, it's incredible that none of them have been arrested over the years," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize this repeat.
"It's a stain on history, a burden on our souls. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

"We want to sue, we want to close, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"We will not be cured and reconciled unless we have justice. "
On July 27, 1946, the coroner placed a bedsheet on the body of a Moore Beach lynching victim.
According to FBI files obtained by the National Broadcasting Corporation News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in lynching.
But none of them have ever been prosecuted.
While suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists have stated that the dual motive for lynching is well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision enabled black citizens of Georgia to vote in the primary election for the first time later in the summer of the year.
According to the FBI, at about the same time, black tenant Roger Malcolm assassinated white landowner Barnet Hearst in a struggle - it looked like it was for a woman.
The rumor in town, Brooks said, was that Hearst slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and her baby wasn't her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landowner, Roy Harrison, spent $600 bailing Malcolm out of prison.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But when they came back from the prison and soon to the Moor Beach Bridge, a group of vigilante thugs surrounded the car.
"It turns out it was Harrison who organized and ordered the murder to be carried out," an FBI report concluded.
" It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witnesses. "
The Brooks are very brief.
He said, "It's a vote tragedy. "
"They were killed, and the killer sent a message to the black people in this community: 'If you register and vote, you will also have the same ending.'"
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . for nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been in charge of leading the annual repertoire of the Moor Beach Bridge lynching.
She's got a clear image of her way of acting, with a deep racist background, and many people want this racism to cease to exist in the United States.
It's hard to look, it's harder not to look, but Green says that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because lynching makes us face up to all the ugly faces," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me, or if you don't hear me tell my story, I can't have a relationship with you. "
This year's show began in June, with nearly 30 actors on the first day - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - crowded in a room to hear Green's overview of the rehearsald performances.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For many years, he played the role of the Klan, but he said that the role was never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Malbau.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive, because we don't want to go back to that era. "
In the room, the actors Darios Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hearst, rehearsed their lines.
. . . . . . . . . . . . at the beginning of the play, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hurst away, outraged that he had slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my land!"
The Rascona hit back.
And then they fight.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) started to laugh.
Green laughs the most.
"What's wrong?" Lascona asked.
He's scared, confused.
Have I overplayed it?
"No," Green laughs.
"I just don't think white people say 'aah ' when they fight back. "
- "Yes," another black actor played fun.
"Your tone must be strong. "
That's it, the energy in the room has changed; the feeling of friendship has driven away the discomfort.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . not only to perform the play, but also to honour the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Lascona said the word "aah", the tone was sharp and powerful.
No one laughs.
It's over powerfully and quickly.
The screams, the shootings, and then, the silence.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Her voice overwhelms the other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty viewers are constantly rubbing sweat and tears.
The audience is almost half black and half white.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . Brooks took them to the cemetery of Malcolm and Dorothy to worship, and the road was almost eight hours away, and everyone was suffering from Georgia's uncomfortable wet heat.
But now, standing on the same land where lynching took place, there was anxiety in the air.
. . . . . . . . . . . . when the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer to the body played by the examiner.
The children bowed down and looked at fake blood and corpses, stealing their words from each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy murmurs, as if reminding himself.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Bradshaw embraces Malbau, a man in a suit who plays three K-heads.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"It's okay," one of the women whispered.
"We know you're not.
You're doing this for a reason. "
After that, the audience sat down for dinner with the actors.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted closely with a black couple they had just met about the reoccurrence.
It's hard for Dennis Duplinsky to find words to describe what she feels after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those terrible words and behaviors that people like you say and make because they look like you," she said.
"It really makes me think that lynching is still going on," she added, "Now this kind of thing is just called a police shooting. "
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sits by the table and watches, tastes and relishs civil rights.
He said he was already planning a performance next year.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . was an encouraging way to describe the horrors we had experienced, but it was also very educative," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, this kind of thing may happen again.
Those who do not study and who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. "
The importance of reform in the area of "independent networks" is self-evident for natural gas market reform, but resistance and controversy are also greater.
The journalist was informed by the Hebei Kaiqi Group on 7 July that at 11.25 a.m. an explosion had occurred in the Dairy Group Chemical Co. Ltd. dairy workshop in the ancient metallurgical area of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, where 13 operators were trapped.
As of now, one of the 13 people trapped has been rescued, rushed to hospital for rescue, and the remaining 12 are in stress search and rescue.
It is understood that the scene has been cordoned off and that local public security, fire, medical and other departments are in the process of rescue.

Associated Press: Scientists at the University of Engineering, China Air Force, study laser satellites for the removal of space litter
On January 18, the Reference Network reported that Chinese scientists had made a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the chaotic Earth orbit and destroy the old satellite and its sky litter.
According to the United States Newsweek website, January 15, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University have written a paper entitled "Study on small-scale space debris reorbiting models for space-based laser removal", which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers using space-based platform lasers into smaller, less hazardous pieces.
The report states that space litter has been an issue of concern to international space agencies for many years, and NASA has considered a variety of options for tracking, detecting and removing man-made debris.
The way to remove large-scale space debris includes the giant web used to clean and collect waste, as well as the magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted laser simulation studies and have concluded that this will be an effective way to clean up Earth's orbit.
The summary of the paper states: " (simulation research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser technology for space debris removal. "
The 2014 study by the United States defense giant Lockheed-Martin found that there were about 200 threats per day for satellites operating in orbit.
The high-speed debris moving along Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions, described by ESA experts as "a deadly series of threats." High-speed debris has continued to increase over the past year.
It was also reported on January 17 that space was essentially empty, but that space was becoming increasingly crowded near the Earth, and that every satellite we sent into space would eventually become another piece of debris that orbited the Earth and that over time, those fragments would pile up.
The more pieces, the higher the chance that a satellite still in operation will be hit by the debris, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The NASA is considering the use of jet gas to reduce the rate of debris and remove it from orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large web, capturing debris, bringing it back to Earth, and Japan is thinking of capturing debris with an electric chain.
At this point, China also proposed a solution to the problem of space litter, whereby floating space litter was struck into less harmful small pieces with a large laser.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers from the University of Engineering of the Chinese Air Force in the German monthly Optical magazine, the installation of such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least on the basis of the results of the simulation.
The report states that the only way to confirm effectiveness is to conduct tests, and there are no arrangements for such missions at present, but perhaps sooner or later someone will install lasers on the satellite and send them into space.
Once this is done, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space litter once and for all.

The suicide bombing of the convoy in Kabul killed NATO soldiers
According to official sources, a military convoy was attacked by suicide bombers in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others.
The NATO statement states that five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in this incident in the Karabagh area of the city.
This is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan - the bombing of the Herat mosque on Tuesday caused more than 30 deaths.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, on Thursday night, a joint Afghan and NATO coalition patrol was attacked by "individually armed improvised explosive devices".
The statement states that all the wounded are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to journalists, the growing Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) organization in the Karabakh region raised serious concerns about NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to United Nations statistics, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, while about 20 per cent of deaths occurred in the capital.
A suicide car bomb attack in the predominantly Shia area of Kabul at the end of July killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claimed that they launched the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in downtown Kabul killed more than 150 people, the most deadly attack by armed elements in the country since the Taliban were overthrown by the United States-led multinational force in 2001.
The violence highlighted the precarious security situation in the United States as President Donald Trump weighed the increase in Afghan troops to support his army and police.
The suicide bombing in Kabul in recent weeks, according to journalists, also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the Government and its policies, in particular Ashraf Ghani, the reputation of the President.

McKee Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko met for the first time to discuss a possible future duel.
The most notable 147-pounder boxing competition will be held shortly, and Vasily Lomachenko and Mackie Garcia, who are currently in a state of potential conflict, first met on Thursday.
In separate rooms in the Los Angeles ESPN office, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead by walking down the corridor, paying tribute to the World Boxing Organization Superfineweight champion Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing on Saturday, the referee unanimously concluded that García had won the four division world champion Adrian Brona, and that by that point both fighters had become the top five on the same weight list.

Yesterday, in the West Side, a major environmental volunteer event was held on the theme of "Green Home, Influence West City"
In contrast to the traditional way in which garbage was picked up and promotional materials were distributed, the organizers set up six game experience areas, including water-saving toilet displays, yeast production experience, traffic domino medals, etc.
At present in the country, many of the children have given up their studies because they target professional golfers, and are smooth on the path of their careers, much less considering universities.
The early completion of the 1105 emission reduction target by officials of the China Disarmament and Reform Commission has given strong expectations for the re-entry of the steel industry, which is constrained by limited electricity production.
While the steel plant has not received a clear notification from the local government that energy efficiency reduction efforts have been completed, industry estimates that on or about 15 December 2010, the steel plants that were originally restricted will be back in production and the steel price will probably begin to pressurize.
No notice of the end of the limited electricity supply has been received, but in practice the pressure on businesses is much less than in September, and in October a private steel company in Hebei province told reporters.
The northern part of the river had repeatedly issued limited-production documents and, at one point, had imposed restrictions on the production of businesses by forcing locks.
Reporters learned from local businesses that steel mills in most of Hebei have now been re-established and production restrictions have eased.
Zhang Tieshan, my steel grid analyst, expects that the end demand for construction steel will gradually shift from strong to weak, as the north is already in winter.
Quite apart from the phase-out of energy-efficient emission reductions, most steel plants will be largely restored around December 15, and the products will continue to reach local markets before New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on the price of steel, which is currently on the right rise.

International Online News (journalist Liu Zi): On 18th, the Economics and Commerce Branch of the Italian Embassy in China organized a China-Italy environmental exchange of views between business and scientific institutions in both countries on the new situation of cooperation between the two countries in the field of renewable resources and reached a positive consensus.
It is known that China is represented mainly by China Regenerative Resources Development Ltd., China International Network for Transfer of Technology, and that the idea is made up of such institutions as the Global Energy Environment Exchange, the Italian Regional Enterprise Federation, etc.
The representative of Italy said that Italy had diverse environmental technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources and proposed pilot projects with China in the areas of industrial waste disposal, waste oil disposal and waste incineration equipment, while looking forward to extending the experience of environmental cooperation with China to the rest of the world.
Updated results of the Swedish age assessment test for asylum-seekers were published
The latest method used for Swedish asylum-seekers testing was to medically assess their age, and the latest results show that over 80% of the testees were convicted of being over 18 years of age, but not all believed in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmedicinalverket) began the test earlier this year.
After being alleged to have failed to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees who claimed to be minors, the Swedish Immigration Service (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Service has sent 6880 testers, and the results of a total of 2481 testers between mid-March and July 31, 2017 have now been published by the Centre for Forensic Medicine.
. 80% (persons) were determined to be 18 years of age or older, however, in another 25 cases, the Swedish National Centre of Forensic Medicine found that the subject was "probably 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "perhaps under the age of 18".
The test is only for people of questionable age.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . according to John Granson of the Center for Forensic Medicine, these results were consistent with the results of the previous months.
He told The Local: "There is no significant difference between these data and those of the previous months, and the numbers are very consistent."
The higher proportion of cases in which 18 years of age or older have been determined does not necessarily mean that these asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the Centre published 581 test results and stated that 442 "surveys indicate that the testee is 18 years of age or older."
The news newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the published 581 test results and found that 243 of them had publicly indicated that they would be 18 years of age this year.
A X-ray examination of intellectual teeth, an MRI scan of the joint, and then an analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists was also questioned in some parts of the medical evaluation.
One of the skeptics was Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work included assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they had gone through puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the news newspaper Metro, "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the way to measure it should be like this.
The determination of the biological age in this way is inaccurate.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it. "
However, Granson of the Forensic Medical Center defended the accuracy of these tests: "It is largely possible to say that there is little uncertainty about determining a child as an adult. "
The greatest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, a situation that accounts for about 10 per cent.

. "Democrats currently have only 15 governors and have the lowest number of control over state councils, and Governor Justice's statement is the latest rejection of a party that lost leadership from top to bottom and could not find an active unifying slogan " . Rona McDaniel, the female president of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Ko praised Russia's "open" apology for the doping scandal.
On Thursday, Sebastian Ko, President of the International Athletics Federation, expressed appreciation for Russia's apology for the doping scandal and stated that it was "open", but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to rejoin the campaign.
The President of the Russian Athletics Federation, Mitry Hiractin, said at the International Athletics Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country was prohibited from participating in the campaign was right and that he was determined to combat doping.
He expressed his regret that "all athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were denied medals. "
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Federation of Fields voted in favour of maintaining the ban. Previously, the report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) mentioned the discovery of evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia, and the ban was imposed in November 2015.
I think today's response was very frank and very frank, and the President of the International Federation of Fields Section told reporters.
"The entire Council and the General Assembly of the United Fields are pleased ... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has gone through a very hot period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia is able to re-enter the competition. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . I think it's a very constructive day, and we've made some progress, but the General Assembly of the Tani League supports the recommendations of the task force, and it is not yet time to resume Russia's eligibility," Ko said.
"We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate innocent athletes from contaminated systems," he added.
The nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict standards of the International Federation of Fields, will compete as neutral athletes in the World Athletics Championships held in London on Friday.

The Federal Reserve's publication of the Economic Brown Book shows that almost all 12 Federal Reserve regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018, and remain optimistic about the prospects for this year.
At the same time, unemployment in the United States remained at 4.1 per cent in December, the lowest since 2000, and businesses are expected to raise their wages in the coming months.

Marketers have pointed out that, in recent times, the ECB monetary policy has tightened expectations of an increase in the euro exchange rate, that the dollar index has declined continuously, and that there has been a corresponding wave of rapid pull-up of the yuan against the dollar exchange rate, but it is unlikely that the ECB will soon adjust its policy stance, that short-term fluctuations in foreign exchange markets will eventually return to basics, and that the continuation of a smooth run of the yuan exchange rate is an approximate event.
It is noteworthy that as the market is expected to be more stable for the yuan, the attraction of the yuan assets to investors abroad is also becoming more pronounced.

The China Environment Award, established in 2000, is the highest award in the field of environmental protection in our country, with a selection committee composed of a number of central departments.
The head of the Selection Committee, Li Wei, Secretary-General of the China Environment Foundation, said that the country was facing ecological problems inherited from its heavy GDP and light environmental development model in previous decades.
The selection of the current China Environment Award is intended to recognize those who contribute to the improvement of the livelihood of the environment, as well as individuals, in order to demonstrate respect for public opinion.
In the view of the Selection Committee, the Zhejiang province of Zhejiang, which is based in Ecolith County, should be honoured with this distinction.

What is the impact of football's financial rules on Neymar's transfer to Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending by European Haumen football clubs do not prevent Nemar from transferring from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the Paris St. Germain Football Club (PSG) in France at record prices.
As a result, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) introduced a further downgrading of the Paris St. Germain Football Club. The Union of European Football Associations is the governing body of European football competitions and has the right to ban teams from participating in the widely noted European Championships.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that the Paris St. Germain Football Club must ultimately prove that Nemar's transfer is funded without causing a huge loss.
The Barcelona Club has paid €222 million ($262 million) just to cover the Brazilian player's settlement costs, while Nemar's salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are some of the financial implications of Nemar's transfer to France.
Taking into account that the team was funded by the ruling family of Qatar, which had a rich atmosphere, the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club could of course sign Nemar in cash and include him in the other star cloud teams.

The Financial Fair Competition Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player argued that if the bank or all were to withdraw their support funds, they were actually cheating and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt to club damage monitoring.
This change means that Roman Abramovich, the business model used when he acquired Chelsea Club in 2003, namely, buying a potential club, then spending a lot of money to improve the team and create a global brand, is now facing a more demanding situation.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . as of 2018's three-year "rule" assessment period, the club could lose €30 million.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . despite Abu's denigration by the then President in 2015, UEFA successor Alexander Seferin remained committed to stopping excessive spending.
The "Rules of course" have not yet expired, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations " , and UEFA is responsible for "Rules"-related matters Andrew Traverso told the Associated Press last week.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. Nemar has signed an agreement for a period of five years, so the transfer may show a cost of Euro44.4 million in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of "rules" sanctions imposed in 2014 led to the harshest sanctions being imposed on the Paris St. Germain Football Club, as well as the Manchester City Club under Abu Dhabi's banner.

In recent interviews with journalists, it has become clear that the benefits of the north-east industry, such as steel and iron, orbital traffic, ships and mechanical manufacturing, have generally declined and even suffered losses.
In the view of some experts, under the current circumstances, the new round of revitalization of north-east industry is not only relevant to the national economic recovery but will also have an impact on the long-term development of our manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, and therefore urgently needs to be transformed.
The general decline in business efficiency in traditional industries, which has lost much of the raw materials industry and the manufacturing of heavy machinery and equipment, is the primary manifestation of the current economic downturn in north-central and north-eastern industries.
In the past, the economy was downhill, mainly low-end, with a high impact on primary products, but in this economic volatility, traditional Northeast industries were high-end, and low-end industrial products were affected.
The Saddle Steel Group (Webbo) began in previous years with the restructuring of products, focusing on the development of high-end plates such as container plates, steel tracks, shipboards and civilian household electric panels, however sales of these varieties have fallen considerably this year, particularly by 50 per cent from the same period last year.
. Saddle Steel shares (Ho Qingshun, Director of the Metallurgy Branch of the CTI of Liaoning Province, said that metallurgy was Liaoning's third pillar industry, with 60 million tons of steel produced annually in third place in the country.
In January-May of this year, Liaoning Province produced 2,154,000 tons of coarse steel, and the national policy encouraged local governments to build stronger projects with better production and marketing conditions, with a greater decline in more competitive products in the market, another feature of the manufacturing industry in the northeast.

The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25% interest rate.
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain the same, as previous weak economic growth and loose inflation have dashed the hopes of the upwards.
The Bank of England warns that, as it controls interest rates while tightening household income, economic growth will continue to be "weak".
The policy makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain a 0.25% interest rate with a 6-2 vote, while a few members this month called for higher interest rates, even if weak economic growth had weakened the boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England scaled growth projections for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, and issued warnings that the contraction of household income would continue, while inflation would surge to nearly 3 per cent in the fall.
But its indication that in the next few years, interest rates will need to be adjusted upwards to contain the inflation brought about by the de-Europeans, while borrowing costs may need to be increased more dramatically as expected in the financial markets.
A year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented as a result of the de-European impact, and members also voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the suspension of the scheduled financing scheme, which will provide cheap funding to banks starting next February, although the bank has stated that under the scheme the bank will now need an additional £15 billion over £115 billion.
In the records of the interest rate decision-making meetings, the Bank of England stated: " In the MPC ' s core projections, gross domestic product (GDP) has remained weak in the recent past, as the contraction of real household income will continue to suppress consumption. "
With regard to interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "a certain monetary policy austerity" to suppress inflation and the need for "a greater degree" than the market expected.
The current market is expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
But the line emphasizes that any increase will be "slow" and "restricted".
The Bank's growth projections for this year and next year show a downward trend, compared with 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent in May.
the bank maintains the forecast of 1.8% growth in 2018.
The exchange rate of the pound to the United States dollar declined, and the euro followed.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent against the United States dollar, reaching 1.31, and 0.4 per cent against the euro, reaching 1.11.
Before the decision-making process, which remained unchanged, the growing upward expectations were dashed by recent unoptimistic growth data. GDP rose to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to 0.2 per cent in the first three months.
The line said that growth in the third quarter might remain at 0.3%, although it would increase slightly at the end of the year.
The average household has been hit by a surge in inflation and wage growth has been negligible, and recent inflation reports by the Bank of England have not given them good news, as the line says austerity will get worse before it gets better.

At the same time, the economy will be stimuli, offset in part by low consumption, due to the devaluation of the pound and the substantial increase in demand for British commodities.
One year before the decision was made, the shocking European Union referendum caused the pound to plummet and the interest rate was revised downwards to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to have a full impact on prices and the British economy.
Before the release of its latest interest rate ruling, the call for interest rates to be increased was not out of the question, as inflation worsened the average family, which was already under pressure, while three decision makers called for an upward adjustment of the rate to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month inflation fell from 2.9 per cent in June to 2.6 per cent, although the Bank of England said it was expected and would rise again in the next few months.
The line calls it a 2% target, and the excess is already entirely the last line of the weak pound.
The director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, Andrew Monterek, said, "In view of the recent fall in interest rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more competitive again, as lenders strongly call for more business and look forward to a positive ending for this year.
For those who may be close to ending existing transactions, such a market seems particularly advantageous, as re-mortgage (many free of charge and low interest rates) is becoming more popular.

The UK National System of Health Services (NHS)
The patient will be able to receive "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after the High Court has settled on the fact that NHS provides drug support.
The NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sexual activity, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection among high-risk populations by about 86%.... Now health services will provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year initial trial.
It agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court decision last year, which stated that, although the NHS claimed that the local authorities should provide funding for the drug, the NHS was entitled to pay the costs of the PrEP.
The move announced on Thursday was called a "significant new intervention" by Simon Stevens, chief executive of the British NHS, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment".
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will become the sexual health clinics registered by the first people. More clinics will join in October, followed by full implementation across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV-positive drug taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The experiment showed that PrEP could significantly reduce the spread of HIV among populations at risk of infection.
Taking the PrEP before sex means that there are enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This drug can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexuals, transgender people and positive HIV carriers who have not been successfully treated.
The clinic will determine whether the participants who met the conditions and who agreed to the test, including men, women, transgender people and those whose sexual partner HIV infection status is unknown, are receiving antiretroviral treatment.
People who reside in England and register as general practitioners can also enrol in sexual health clinics in which they attend locally.
The plan will cost £10 million, while the NHS England branch has signed a contract to purchase these drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The experiment aims to assess the full potential of the PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr. Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and reinforce HIV prevention on a broad and increasingly successful basis.
This is another milestone in actions worth making progress in addressing the major health challenges of humankind over the years. "

If it does target populations in need and at risk, then pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the possibility of changing the AIDS epidemic in the UK.
From September, the HIV-at-risk population will receive a new authorized tool in England through this experiment, funded by the NHS, which is truly stand-alone and does not require consultation with sexual partners, which will bring about improvements in the lives of a few people.
We have both hands in favor of this announcement. "

Now that we've purchased the ProP test drug, we're ready to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV. "
The Shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgeson, claimed, "After months of delay and government delays, PrEP's initial test starts very popular and should have arrived earlier.
The evidence shows how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This experiment will allow us to go further and fully understand the advantages of the PREP.
It is now very important that this experiment be introduced nationwide as soon as possible in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further to end the spread of HIV in society ... "

High quality of life: applying loft and clever design to make the small apartment of the Count's Palace a spacious home
. Joanne Ray was a banker and she was keen to renovate the house, and in 2014 she moved from the large house at Knight's Bridge to a small apartment at the Count's Palace.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne-style terrace -- Joanne didn't pack and sell it, which is a strong proof of the new design.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"I was looking for the right house to offer.
I saw this apartment at the Count's Palace, and its ceiling was high.
I liked it, and I made an offer the same day. "
Since the first look at the house, this 1,000 square feet apartment has now been completely overhauled.
This apartment was originally a complex one-room layout -- going through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- Joanne wanted to add storage space and attics to make full use of the full ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's what I'm asking, "She said.
For this reason, she hired Elfan Azadi from Duck&Shed Building and Design Studios (located in Notting Hill) to use this 12.5-foot-high ceiling to elaborate a home that not only develops projects, but also where Joanne lives.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to increase two upper and lower spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a loft that is high enough for people to stand.
Irvan has to think creatively in order to solve this problem.

"We must arrange for space to be displayed, and there is no need to shrug the back of the bow.
It's not just so simple to build a simple platform, but to start with these steels to put them at the right height to perform their functions. "
Through this arrangement, Elfan is able to obtain two full-bodied rooms in that space -- in which many interesting elements can be added.
The loft uses retrouvius branded retrouvius copper windows that can overlooking fascinating living areas.
The golden furniture with mirrors, the silver little piece of furniture and the Serge Mouille Retrolight laid out the whole style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.

"In essence, real estate agents will walk into the room and calculate according to the size of the floor. "
They will find ways to increase the amount of space they occupy while using high-quality materials, thus giving this space a sense of luxury.

40 years after his Italian family founded the dynasty, the two brothers fought for more than $500 million, one of Victoria's largest real estate empires.
The former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lived in a mansion located in Tukara district, while the distance of the three doors was his brother Paul's residence, who brought him to the Supreme Court for the division of their real estate and business assets.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . since 2014 Paul had wanted to leave the family business, but the two brothers had a heated debate in the Supreme Court over this division of assets.
The brothers and their mother owned a total of 38 real estate properties worth more than $500 million, which had accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In 1999, the company was sold for $85 million.
After that, the money was invested in real estate. Currently, the combined assets of the De Rutis family include the city office building, the Brunswick and Sorento development project, the Gold Coast and Bull Hill apartments, and the suburban shopping centre.

The paper submitted to the Tribunal stated that, as a result of conversion, Colin owned property worth $316 million, while Paul owned property worth $176 million.
. . . Paul came to believe that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the negotiations.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Last Friday, after several mediation failures, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Now, the brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in the early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed the wish to settle the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines that the family is the most important option... my Italian descent determines that the family is the most important " , he wrote.
The cost of the case continues to climb, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails, and company reports submitted by top law firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. De Rutis and her late husband, Luigi, both Italian immigrants, who started running popular restaurants and deliments from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
And Colin said, "When I read a senior year," where he founded Westco, "At that time, Paul was very small (about 10 years old). "
Anna De Rutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to pass on their property to their son in peace.
. . . . . . . . . . . Luigi often says to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court. " . she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of the De Rutis Group, and Colin said that when Mark left the company, he paid him $10 million and $26 million.
. . . . . . . . . . neither Luke nor Mark "expressed their dissatisfaction with the provisions of the division of their property." Paul said.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . according to the television star Eddie McGuire to the biography published in 2015, although Colin was a member of the board of directors of the former AFL club, he kept low profile.
The Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul on Friday, as well as their lawyers.
But, only Colin responded by text message. He said, because the case had been brought before the court "I really can't say much. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . my brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court, which was very, very sad " . he wrote.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet the demands of his brother.
He said, "Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like this," and added that he "still has hope for the resolution of the dispute."
On Friday, this hope seems to have been dashed.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future." . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Trump's new chief of staff planned to limit the President's media time.
other people have tried, but they all end up failing.
John F. Kelly may really be able to do it.
If that's true, then he's the first.
According to the U.S. political news site Politico, the new White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump — including media reports — with a view to ensuring greater stability for the big boss.
Here is a quote taken from journalist Josh Dowsey:
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . when the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, began his first day of work and gathered with senior officials to discuss it, he noted that he was addressing one of President Trump's main problems of entering the White House: bad information to the President's hands."
. . . . . Kelly told these officials that receiving good information helps the President to make better decisions, so the information needs to go through his hands — either in writing or in the form of a briefing.
. . . . Kelly's diagnosis looks alike, but others have tried to tame Trump by watching Trump's media time, but it all ended in failure.
President Trump's television addiction has been long-standing — now in the White House, his habit of watching television is still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberg told Politico, "If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, then it would be useful to let him know that he has also received positive coverage on credible channels.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . based on the experience of the six former campaign officials, the focus of the tradition of controlling Trump's tweets was to ensure that he had always included a certain amount of praise in the media messages he personally received. "
It's totally fine.
But the view that Trump's Twitter habit once was "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know — that if they didn't intervene, Trump's Twitter would even get even hotter.
We probably never knew those tweets Trump didn't send.
If his staff can save him in the fire, even a few times, their efforts are worth it.
But no one can keep Trump out of controversy.
One part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of competing groups, people promote their worldviews by presenting potentially reliable and possibly unreliable information to Trump and flaunting their cause.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is an example described by journalist Shane Goodmancher:
. . . . . . . . . . . . present and former Trump officials said that Trump's reaction to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive information leaks, would be insanely trying to find their sources.
At the end of February, there was a malicious copy to the President of an article on the web agitator Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the White House's "source of massive leaks of information", as Trump did at the time.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned by Twitter for harassment, he had not provided any specific evidence, and he had blown up a lot of false accusations, which he later publicly denied.
" Trump looked at the article and then began asking officials about Walsh. "
. . . . . Goodmancher also said that then Chief of Staff Reins Pribas and White House Secretary Robert Potter "had tried to set up a system to manage and record documents received by Trump."
What happened?
Kelly was going to do the same thing, three months later.
Maybe he can prove that he is a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump is still that impulsive Trump, while his assistants are still competing against each other for influence.
These eternal influences will make Kelly's mission more difficult.
Tourist town: How the wind is drunk.
The potential of Zhejiang Town was gradually awakened.
Today these towns, which have become an important destination for Zheshan tourists to appreciate Zheshan water, to read Zheshi culture, and to feel the sorrows of Zhe country, will also provide an important contribution to my efforts to build the Poetry of Zhejiang, China's most American tourist destination.

In recent years, the potential of the town of Zhejiang has been gradually awakened with the advance of my province-wide tourism construction.
In 2016, the provincial government office officially released the Zhejiang province's tourist town creation implementation scheme, proposing to name 100 provincial tourist town around five years of time in the province-wide inspection and acceptance, with a fine ecological environment and a tourist-rich tourist town.
Today these towns, which have become an important destination for Zheshan tourists to appreciate Zheshan water, to read Zheshi culture, and to feel the sorrows of Zhe country, will also provide an important contribution to my efforts to build the Poetry of Zhejiang, China's most American tourist destination.
The relevant head of the provincial tourism bureau introduced the fact that, in the heat of the creation of tourist-friendly small towns, I now place greater emphasis on the construction of individualized tourism industries in various towns of the province, and that new tourism projects and industrial patterns have emerged, bringing a great deal of experience to visitors and earning a good reputation.
Focusing on replication
In recent days, the Zhejiang Department of Tourism, the Zhejiang Daily Newspapers Group, hosted by the Zhejiang Group Tourism All-Media Center, shared and painted Zhejiang? town has a windy 2017 Zhejiang Tourist Windstown promotional season closing at the Zhejiang Provincial Exhibition.

The many popular tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources, and the small towns from the south coast of Lake State have been newly built to interpret the country's painting for you at the scene.
The Jiangnan Village has been popular with book painters since ancient times, and today, the town of Namangu is working in depth with arts colleges, such as the Chinese Academy of Beauty.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The service facilities and environment of tourism are also very important elements in this.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In this age of sharing, the hottest shared umbrella company in the Zhe newspaper group's tourism-wide media centre has customised a group of shared umbrellas for the Zhejiang edition of Poetry, hoping to promote the concept of "Share?

This became one of the highlights of the Poetry Zhejiang? Town with Winds, 2017 Zhejiang Touring Windstown promotional season.
I'm looking forward to it.
To date, Zhejiang province has released the first 21 provincial tourist town creation lists and 115 provincial tourist town breeding lists.
As a priority area for the development of priority areas during the "1355" period of rural tourism, Windtown will eventually become a 3A-level tourist attraction, becoming a new model of tourism product diversity, high tourism efficiency, and industrial integration for win-wins.
The key to the attraction of a tourist-friendly town is its original juicy taste.
The beauty of a small tourist town, not only from the small bridges of smoke and rain, but also from a long cultural tradition; the country's revitalization, derived from cultural self-confidence.

In the case of windy towns, the focus on "embracing, staying home" gives the town a distinct personality and soul, and more about providing a culture of immersion, carrying local literature, and highlighting the country's civilisation.

In essence, a tourist-friendly town is a complex, open tourist attraction, and should be a shared living space for local residents and foreign tourists, and even travelers.
As the main battleground for future tourism growth, tourist-friendly small towns are not only likely to change rural ecology, the way economic and social development takes place, the direction of industrial elements flows, but are also important forces in closing the rural-urban infrastructure gap and awakening rural cultural recovery.
In the great tide of accelerated rural revitalization, the Zhejiang tourist-friendly town will be performing a much richer and wonderful story.

Italy ' s hard-line approach to NGO migrant rescue ships
Italy warns non-governmental organizations operating migrant rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue with the rescue unless new operational management norms are signed.
In an interview with the Turin Daily News, Minister of the Interior Marco Minnity said, "If NGOs do not sign new norms of conduct, it is hard to see how they will succeed. "
On the day before Minnity's warning, the Italian official seized the German aid organization "Youth Help" crew members of a ship who were in fact colluding with human traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operates for only one year and refuses to comment on the specific subject of charges by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Caltosio.
In a social media statement, the organization stated, " For us, saving lives is, and will be, the most important thing, so we regret not being able to operate in the SAR area at this time. "
" Once all the information has been gathered, we can now only assess all the allegations and situations ... "
The Italian official has been watching the Youth Rescue ship, Iuventa, since October.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to the prosecutor's document, at least one such meeting was said to have taken place at sea 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast.
The crew was suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversaw the area's rescue operations out of humanitarian enthusiasm and not any other motive.
In accordance with the norms of conduct, ships such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer to oversee their activities on board.
At present, of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations, only three have agreed to comply with the norms of conduct, namely, Save the Children, the Immigration Maritime Aid Station based in Malchia and the Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new provisions to be unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring about any "significant changes and obstacles" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti stated that the number of immigrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks had plummeted, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal escorts and unite local mayors had begun to bear fruit.
The Minister said, "For the last few days, we have begun to see the dawn at the end of the tunnel. "
He announced plans for in-depth talks this month: with Libyan mayors on economic development activities and with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of immigrants wishing to leave these countries for Europe.
The Chief Financialist of the Transport Bank, even Ping, said that industrial value added was expected to accelerate to 6.6 per cent in December, due to the end of the season characterized by industrial value added in the first three quarters of 2017.
The cumulative increase in fixed-asset investment is expected to be 7.2 per cent in December, at the same rate as last month, lower than last year.
. Industrial production, though weak in October, remains essentially the same as November.
In December, however, our manufacturing investment was low, but there was a slight improvement in capital investment, so it is expected that the investment in fixed assets will be even in November of that month.

Beijing "High School Detachment" new initiative: 10,000 teachers and students from North Chemical will be admitted to the new campus in Changping
The inauguration of the new campus of the Beijing Chemical University was held in Changping District, Beijing, and the 1,800-acre green campus was officially operational.
The journalists learned from the ceremony that in recent years, in the context of the collaborative development and alienation of the non-capital functions of Kyushu in order to strengthen the capital's core functions and to govern the "major city disease", Beijing has accelerated the diversion of the central urban high schools to the suburbs, and that teachers and students of some colleges are moving to new campuses in suburban areas such as Shunyi, Da Xing, and Hiyayama.
The new campus of North Chemical is located in Changping Namkou Township, covering 1,800 acres, 40 km from the city, and is one of the priority projects for Beijing City to defunct non-capital functions.
The new school was built in three separate phases, and the current phase has been fully completed, and phase two is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year, and the full completion plan will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduate, graduate and teaching staff to learn and live.
When looking back at the film market this year, we find that the original text of the film and the two crowds of participating stars become an important part of the film's intended audience.
At 1710 hours today, the 119th Command Centre of Shangyang City was alerted to a fire in the storage of the tetrahydrofuran at the Hongchi Chemical Plant in Longshu Tong, in the city ' s twin-clear area.
The Shunyang City Fire Division immediately deployed five squadrons of 20 fire trucks with heavy protective clothing and equipment such as a protective washing car to the scene.
. After preliminary investigation, the fire started with small storage tanks for chemical substances such as tetrahydrofuran, which produced a large amount of smoke at the site.
As of the time of the reporter's release, firefighters were nervous about rescue, city health, security, environmental, security, transport and so on, and no casualties had been detected.
Michelle Carter was sentenced for sending text messages to encourage Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Now 20-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months and can be converted to a suspended sentence upon expiry.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in June 2014 Conrad Roy was found guilty of unintentional and unpremeditated murder.
. . . . . . . . Roy's father said at a hearing on Thursday, "My family is devastated.
My son is my best friend. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . while awaiting appeal, Carter was allowed to maintain his personal freedom.
She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, but her lawyers believe that both she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . at the sentence, Carter stood and wore red long pants and rice coats, with his hands tied tight, with tears in both eyes, and his eyes looking down.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"She ended his life in order to live better.
She was not held responsible " , the prosecutor said.
"She doesn't have any remorse. "
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence, and she felt very sorry for it. "
However, Lawrence Moniz, the judge, said that he had not found her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, could have any significant impact on her behavior."
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying, "I haven't had a day without a heartache for losing my beloved son.
I hope he's proud of what I and I have done... and I'm trying to stand with his sisters in all my pains, which will accompany us forever " , stated.
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "mental" because she realized that she could never attend her brother's wedding or become his child's aunt.
"The loss of a man who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and the rest of my life will be tied to it." she said.
This case seems to have set a legal precedent, as Massachusetts law does not make it a crime to encourage others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; in that year, Carter was 17 years old.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after Carter's text revealed that she had encouraged him to commit suicide, the case drew national attention.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . two weeks before his death, she had stated in several text messages that he was on vacation with his family.
The time before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," and "All you have to do is start the generator, and then get free and happy."
Justice Moniz said that Carter had drawn attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There is a difference of legal opinion in this case.
The few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, was one of them, and she was charged with murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and was acquitted two years later.
In a column published in the Los Angeles Times, Ms. Knox, 30, said, "Michel? Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment. "

Automakers face shocks, and Odyssey will transform up to 850,000 diesel vehicles.
The day before Odie announced the conversion, BMW said it would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 cars.
The BMW chairman said that BMW believed that "driving has more intelligent choices than restrictions", meaning that major cities in Europe - including Munich, where BMW's headquarters are located - consider prohibiting or restricting diesel vehicles.

The cost of auto companies installing equipment to offset diesel tail gas emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As the German automobile manufacturer faced censorship, the government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel was accused of leaving too much of these powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the popular practice of covering up their use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions to meet regulations at car testing, and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.

The former manager, Zachero Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected by extradition and may face trial in the United States.
earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the general public, and the German government accused Audi of installing a system to evade European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation previously limited to the United States.

Provence lavender is threatened by climate change
The lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but there is now bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
The lavender is decaying due to the persistence of drought and the presence of insects carrying the virus, which causes headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
The expert at the Institute of Agricultural Research (CRIEPAM) in Provence, Eric Chaisse, said, "Provence's lavender is facing a great threat, as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with a significant drop in spring rainfall, while the fall has been rainy.
This will affect the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller species of individuals, a leaf that can spread tiny bacteria, and in very dry weather they will appear in large numbers. "
The point is that it's huge in numbers.

Two senior journalists discussed which was more secure: whether to take their children to the office (the office had been attacked by grenades in 2009) or whether to leave them at home.
The security expert wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: the enemy, the neutral and the ally.
They gave these reporters names in each column — no evidence needed, enough observation and intuition.
There are suspicions that drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on government lists, or cartels, these villains put Mexican reporting in danger.
The violence has never stopped, and the nation's bodies have spread, with more and more journalists: according to the records of the Commission for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after being attacked and threatened; and so far this year, at least 7 journalists have died in seven states.
The last dead was their editor and source of inspiration, as well as Javier Valdiz Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdiz wrote many books on drug violence, in one of which he wrote, "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist. "
You can feel that he's gone, though he's everywhere — a huge picture hanging on the front of the "Riodoce" office building, Valdiz is erecting a finger with the word "justice"; two 30-year-old journalists, Aaron Ivara and Miriam Ramirez, also have his smile on their T-shirts, which he wears with glasses or his iconic Panamagrasss hat.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and suspicion.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists ' cases, according to the records of the Commission for the Protection of Journalists, the office prosecuted only two people.
The majority of the thousands of crime cases per year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so few can bring to justice those who kill journalists.

Ivara said that without information about the killer, without justice, it would not be useful to have a safety seminar.
He said, "It's stupid to waste time attending a seminar like this.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone. "
On the morning of May 15, Valdiz left the "Riodoce" office of the capital, Culiacan.

The outlaws left in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez, 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two adult children behind.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But there's actually nothing but silence on Valdez's topic.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, the state of Sinalo has become the bloodiest battlefield in the country, where hostile forces are raging.
One or more people are shot every day in the streets of Sinalo, and the cemetery is filled with lavish two-story mausoleums of drug lords, which are already common.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . is the time when only one cartel controls this coastal state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even then, even though Valdez was deeply aware of the dangers of the job, 60-year-old "Riodoce" co-founder and director Ismael Bohoqui was still guilty of failing to protect his friends.
He believed that two mistakes had caused this tragedy.
The first, in February, was the publication of the Damaso Lopez interview, which led a cartel group that fought several of Gutzmann's sons.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspaper was bought off by suspected gang members as soon as it arrived at the newsstand.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper reporting the same story was confiscated.
. Valdiz is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great importance to Mexican violence against journalists.
His spirit has long existed, and his friends and colleagues believe he's always been with us.
In 2003 he was also a senior journalist for "Noroeste", and that year he joined five colleagues to start "Riodoce", selling $50 shares.
Pohoque said that in Sinalo, "Step-to-news can't stay away from dealing with the drug problem."
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . as time passed, the newspaper gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
. . . . . . reporters like to be able to publish investigative reports that hit hard without fear of censorship, and readers like to publish stories that others are afraid to report.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . five years after its founding, the Riodoce received the María Moskapo Prize for
The same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdez International Press Freedom Award, in recognition of his courage to pursue the most real Mexican drug coverage.
He said he was scared too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said, "I want to go on living."
Later in late October, in an interview with local television station Rompeviento TV, he said, "In Sinalo, drug trafficking is a way of life, and it's a way of life.
You have to take the task of being a journalist on your shoulders — either so or deaf.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many deaths... why don't you say something about what's happening?"
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guyabo bar that often goes across the office and always sits on the same table.
Now, they'll ask, "Is it his everyday habits that caused his fall?"
His death also forced them to think about how to do their job and live well.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That's all over their bottom line. "
The result is to maintain a high level of self-censorship and self-protection, even at the safest times.
Believe in your instincts.
If you smell dangerous, stay away.
Andres Villaril, editor of Riodoce, said, "The problem is that the aura is a feeling that will be deceived ... and then something like Javier will happen."
He and others said that the previous rules were no longer applicable in Sinalo State — just as they were no longer applicable in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes were profitable, while institutions were weak, government officials were corrupt, smoked.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where "Riodoce" employees attend security training, cell phones are suddenly not allowed to be used; a few days ago, spy software allegedly sold only to the Government was already used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took a cold in the shade, avoiding a high temperature of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were sent by the state government to protect the offices of "Riodoce", which are located in a four-story building in the Kulyacan Middle Class neighborhood.
Some journalists are jokingly saying that they don't know if these cops belong to 50% of what the governor himself says.
The journalists have been going to the mountains for several months, where drug cartels are under real control.
This week's "Riodoce" featured three major stories.
Among them were the killing of brothers of Julio Cesar Chavez, a great former boxer in Sinalo, who had been killed in the early 1980s.
And the governor's home government funding disclosure.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . and
The official did not publish information about the abduction of the person and the abduction process, so it was necessary to be cautious when writing down what the city knew: that the restaurant was a place where both drug dealers and the official authorities loved it.
A journalist learned from a public file that the restaurant was registered with the ruling party, the Revolutionary System Party (PRI), a politician who dominated the political spectrum almost throughout the last century.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in several highly valued cases. . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If a few months ago, readers would have looked at Valdez's column to find the strongest information about the kidnapping.
The 46-year-old Villarill, who was called "slender" because of his thin body, said that "a long time ago, we knew what was going on.
Now all of our sources of information have been cut off.
. . . . . . . . Valdez's office is now used to store signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed a sign out of the room and went to the office of the local prosecutor to attend a march related to another journalist.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . three days after Valdiz's murder, El Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacán.
Officially, a burned body was found, and according to DNA tests, that's his body.
All over the country, journalists have become more outspoken, and they organize protests and paint the words "Save the Media" on sidewalks and buildings.
This day, director Bohoque is not in Washington, D.C. He is working to bring justice and gain international support for the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the Governor of Sinalo, Ramirez complained about official espionage of journalistic information and killed them because they told the truth.
Given that her anger had affected her objectivity, she also called for her resignation from the post of reporting on government affairs.
. Valdiz has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are "encircled" by organized crime, mixed government officials and indifferent societies.
In his last book, Drug News, he wrote that journalists are not only maimed by drug trafficking groups, but are on the list of politicians and security forces who share the same stigma as organized crime.
The Media Monitor Group Articulo 19 blames police and public officials for more than half of last year's journalistic attacks.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up."
It's obvious that these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, the blogger Maria Elizabeth Marcias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
There's a note next to her body that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my report."
Her head was cut off, with a computer keyboard and headphone next to her.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after Miroslava Brych's murder in March, some newspapers chose to close down, such as the "El Norte" newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua.
The others are continuing, and the directors of "El Manana of Nuevo Laredo" were killed in 2014, but they are continuing.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke openly about the drug cartel with a front-page news article entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some of the journalists fled their home country, or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and they still need to be careful and wary of danger on the streets.
Sometimes they will be arrested, reportedly killed in 2015 by photographer Ruben Espinosa in a Mexican city three months after fleeing Veracruz, along with four women.
For those who stay behind the scenes and continue to work, this is a daily dance of high-risk decision-making.
Ivara had wanted to be a poet, and he admitted that reporting on the drug trade scared him.
He said, "Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
In the middle of the last Friday, the most recent edition of the newspaper has been printed, and the editors of Riodoce are sitting on the walkway outside the office drinking beer, and suddenly their cell phone rings.
A series of gunfights between rival gangs and security forces near the beach resort city of Masatland have confirmed the deaths of 19 people.
The fighting is still escalating, as the series of cartel information found in the area foresaw.
They uploaded the news to Riodoce's website on the side of the road via their cell phone.
The headlines of the next day had to be changed.
The siren sounded nearby — another live-and-death duel shootout in the area.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If they're a little scared, then they don't show it.
The founder of this newspaper has been killed, and on his large portrait, his middle points to where the entire state of Sinalo needs to look, and the entire staff of "Riodoce" follows his pace.
"How can you even want to shut down? On the same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street for coverage."
China's auto-driving tourism market size or breakthrough of trillion yuan in 2020
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in the general context of consumer escalation and the prevalence of free trade, self-drive is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly popular with consumers.
At the same time, however, self-driving markets, which are expected to break the trillions, face a double challenge.
In the general context of consumer escalation and the prevalence of free trade, self-drive is encouraged by national policies and is favoured by a growing number of consumers.
At the same time, however, self-drive organizers, such as self-driving clubs and travel agencies, face a double challenge, on the one hand, with the development of the self-drive industry not proportional to market demand, and on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by self-drives are at an early stage.
60 per cent of the country's population, market size is expected to be broken by trillions of dollars.
In 2016, 4,440 million domestic trips took place, with self-drives occupying about 60 per cent of the country ' s total tourism population, and the size of the self-drive market is expected to break through trillions of dollars by 2020.
According to the statistics of the Chinese Tourist Ship Association on the number of self-driving travellers, the number of travellers has continued to grow over the past five years, with the proportion of tourists in the country stabilizing at more than half.
At the same time, more attention and support have been shown at the regional and national levels in the emerging area of self-driving, and from 2016 to 2017, policy regulations relating to self-driving, residential and camping tourism were introduced in an intensive manner.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Authority, the National Sports Directorate and others, jointly released the Automotive Sports Camp Development Plan; in the same month, self-driving tours were highlighted in the Programme of Action for the Promotion of Rural Tourism Development Upgrading (2017), jointly issued by 14 departments, including the CDC, the Ministry of Finance and others.
The introduction of policies provides opportunities and policy guidance for domestic self-drive development.
The self-drive club has a small profit, and the complete industrial chain is the key.
. Although domestic self-driving markets have great potential and national policies have been actively directed, the self-driving industry is still in its early stages.
According to the Annual Development Report for China's Self-Driving Tour, 2016-2017, there are thousands of home-based self-driving clubs, auto clubs, car clubs, etc., but the percentage of visitors who self-help arrangements for self-driving trips is in the majority, and the proportion of visitors to various institutions such as the Association of Auto-Drives, and the Self-Drive Club is only around 15 per cent.
At the same time, online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies that independently develop their own cruise products are also numerous, and only self-driving products from some suppliers are sold on many online tourism platforms, and some self-driving clubs are also important suppliers.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The founder and CEO Lee Chongjie of the Beijing Automobile Club considered the self-driving club to be essentially similar to the travel agency, and the main early profit model was dominated by offline activities, with the core point being self-driving line products and lead service.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It can be seen that self-drive is not an independent industry in itself, but rather that it is important to form a cross-geographical, industry-wide ecoregion that forms a complete industrial chain with its self-drive migration characteristics.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in addition to basic tourism consumption. . . . . . . . .
Therefore, for the development of the self-drive industry, the empirical features should be enhanced, and the IP of the "self-drive +" theme and self-drive products should be developed.
Landscape lanes are not just roads. Car camps aren't just for food and accommodation.

The landscape is no longer the most direct and rapid route between departure and destination, but follows the design concept of "experienced driving fun" to provide the best enjoyment for self-driving tourists to appreciate the beauty of the road; the landscape is capable of connecting dotted, face-to-face tourist landscapes, both preserving the historical and cultural value of ecotourism resources along the route and organizing a variety of thematic events to enhance the participatory and recreational experiences of visitors and create economic benefits for local tourism.
In addition to the viewing lanes, the camp is an important accompanying facility for self-driving trips.

Some industry people who did not want to reveal their names said that many of the businesses that had been camping in previous years had been trying to get land, after which, the accompanying infrastructure and services had not kept up, that many of the operating conditions were losses, and that it was difficult to make some of the corresponding products without a later infusion of funds.
Consumption group
According to data published by the China Tourist Boat Association in 2017, the self-drive group is concentrated in the 21-40 age group, in particular in the 31-40 age group, which has a certain economic base and has a higher demand for personalized tourism and is mostly a parent-child tourism customer.
From the accommodation survey, the self-driving population is relatively more inclined towards non-standard accommodation.

At the same time, as consumer demand rose, tourists who used to love to drive their own "travel attractions" began to change their perception and were no longer "go out and take pictures, get in the car and sleep" during their own trip, but focused more on the experiences and processes of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguise to hide from their enemies.
At first glance, it's kind of scary, but it looks like a statue.
. . . . . . . the researchers published their first research on the incredible biofossil found by Canadian miners of the size of rhinoceros, noting that the fossil was preserved well, so the experts referred to it as "Mona Lisa in the Dinosaurs".
This fossil is very well preserved, and it can even be concluded that its scales skin is red brown, which means that it has had some "fearful experience."
The relevant reports in the magazine Contemporary Biology describe it as "the best preserved Beatles ever discovered, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of knot dragon, living in the middle of the white genus from 110 million to 112 million years ago.

It took the researchers six years to show the true face of this beast hidden inside the 2500 lbs (1,100 kg) of earth.
After such a hard work, the final results are now published.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Terrier Museum, the first author.
"It will be one of the most beautiful and preserved specimens in the history of science - Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world. "
. . . . . . . . . . . by studying its skin, researchers found that this herbivorous creature, while wearing armor, was like a walking tank, was likely to be under major threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.

But this dinosaur is buried under the sea floor so that its cape can be preserved in its entirety.
The fossil remains of this particular sample are very well preserved, leaving the remaining skin still covered with the disfigured nails on the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine, this level of preservation is very rare, as it is in the middle colour.
The more I look at it, the more I think it's incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered in the capped armor on the skull of the dinosaur.

Reporters learned that adding sea algae acids, corrosive acids and amino acid efficiency carriers from natural or plant sources to urea production processes can improve the efficiency of traditional urea, resulting in an increase of 5-10 percentage points in the use of sea algae urea, zinc urea, and vesal urea nitrogen compared to normal urea.
The environment is friendly and the potential for increased crop production is evident, especially for large granular value added urea, which is a quality raw material for BB fertiliser.
This total number of security personnel is twice as high as the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympics.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security linkage plan ever.
. Previously, the Brazilian Government stated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and the police, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 police, would work together.
The majority of the military personnel will be responsible for defending the Olympic stadium, while the 3,000 additional military personnel will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets.
The police patrol the rest of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is known that 6,000 troops have now arrived in Rio for Olympic security services.

How do radicals learn to answer this question: "Who's street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was in a state of internal disquiet.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louisman sat on the Edby's rented bed and browsed the Facebook web on his cell phone.
She stumbled on a high school student's post.
It says, "Police just killed an 18-year-old kid, who's still lying on the street."
She found no one else to release the message on the feed, and she was confused.
A @TheePharaah user keeps pushing dynamic Times to her.
The death of Michael Brown, a unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, was televised live by a rapper in the area of St. Louis.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . he
"Crazy," Ferrell thought.
But for her and her community, death is nothing new.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There's a police video and a photo of people screaming, and there's a photo of a man who calls himself Brown's father, and it says, "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed, and a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
She said, in another video, another cop raised his rifle screaming: "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrell recalled, saying.
"It's not common for us to call it a typical murder. "
That moment, I felt a little chilly.
I'm angry, I'm crying. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 o'clock, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary, "Who's Street?", released in the cinema on August 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and perseverance from the perspective of people living in this community, crowded with street alleys demanding answers.

"Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their own faith?" she recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right.
I had to take her, "Ferrell later said.
"What happened today is the culmination of all the things of the past.
She wants to know, see and rise from this.
Not only does she need to develop well in radicalism and organization, but she needs to understand the different dimensions of black experience and black situation and what we have to do to gain freedom and liberation.
Even if I had the privilege of giving her a racist experience she had not experienced personally, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I think I'm hurting her. "
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop at a site opposite the South Florida Road Police Department, a site where militants waited until police officer Darren Wilson finally failed to prosecute, and the site became their camp.

They prepared the bag and were responsible for passing it to the protesters.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
She said, "My radicalism changed completely after August 9. "When attending undergraduate school at the State University of Missouri, St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Minority Nurses, focusing on the food justice and health gap in black communities.
"I have no organizational experience.
That's how it's all coming. "
. . . . . . . . . . a few weeks later, Ferrer met with film co-director Sabah Foleyan during a night march.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The question in Ferrer's head is: "Are you trying to record or find a story you can use?"
This suspicion comes from many such cases: people - usually white - enter a community in order to benefit from their pain and resilience.
As Foleyan explained in a recent interview, "We have heard that people native to Ferguson have not focused their voices, and we want to do it in a different way. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
His involvement brought Ferrell into the "Who's Street?" project team, along with six other locals, for several years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary isn't about people talking to us or talking to us, that's what we're talking about. " Davis said.
"I'm mainly concerned about how these characters are presented, because that's how I'm presented. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . not to focus on Ferrer's experiences . . . . . . but to show that the campaign was "not about the Savior's leader, but about community cohesion," Fougheyan said . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The result, "Who's Street?", is a surprising record of Ferrell's personal life, such as falling in love and getting married.
I feel naked, "Ferrell laughs when he first sees the finished product.
"But I understand that doing this and humanizing black people requires a certain degree of vulnerability. "
In addition, Ferrel's story reaffirms and repositions the role of black cool women in the broader black life event movement.
. Two of the three founders of the movement -- created #BlackLivesMatter in social media after the 2012 Black Teen Trevorn Martin shooting -- were identified as Cool.
. . . . . . black cool women in the leadership generally supported the movement," Ferrer said, "That's because we're fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to bear all this. "
"This movement is really supported by black women and many black cool women. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . because of her identity, Ferrell was chosen to be the core of the film. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"She's the one who inspires this energy," she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence... because you have a lot to do as a black cool woman in these crossroads.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy. "
At the same time, in Ferguson, news cameras have long disappeared, but the racial tensions between the community and the police persist.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . during a parade attempt to block the highway, Ferrell was given a suspended sentence of more than two and a half years.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in what she calls a home: "a mess."
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"We have a duty to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We have to love each other and support each other.
We can't lose any more, except the chains on our bodies. "
In fact, online translation services were available on the web 10 years ago, while in fact, a long time ago, the argument that "machines are about to replace humans for translation" was not out of the question.
Similarity: Artists use the DNA of Chelsea Manning to create portraits.
There are several faces in the center of the gallery at the Friedman Gallery in New York: white, black and brown, with almost undetectable similarities between each face, which are tied by threads falling down from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Hesser Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning's mail to her cheek cottonmarks and hair crumbs.
The former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking confidential diplomatic telegrams via the WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition opened on 2 August under the title "Similarities".
This was the result of two years of communication between Dewey Hagburg and Manning, who combined its disciplines with her own in technology, computer science and art, while Manning was a well-known dissident who had been imprisoned and had completed transsexual surgery in prison. United States former President Barack Obama pardoned her for the remainder of her sentence three days before the end of her term.
By doing an algorithm analysis from Manning's DNA, and by creating 30 portraits of "very likely appearances," Heather Dewey Haborg made a sharp and slightly ruthless comment, which was both multidimensional to DNA and to the concept of identity itself.
The name of Manning when he was born was Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted that he considered herself to be a woman at puberty.... He was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including 6 espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image is suppressed, with only one photograph, a picture of herself in black and white with a sense of particles, which looks obviously restless, sitting in a driving seat, wearing a platinum-gold wig.

In that work, she used secondary court exhibits from cigarette butts and gums, DNA extracted from the crumbs, creating a portrait of a possibly similar 3D character.
That's an email she just got from Paper magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a photo of him " , said Heather Dewey Haborg to the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning was unable to visit and take photographs, so they contacted Chelsea to ask her if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
So, the artist and her imprisoned mus became the impossible pen pals who exchanged many letters with each other over two years.
They even created a comic book, The Repressive Head, drawn by Shoili Kanungo, which envisaged that the President could grant privileges to Manning in the future and that she could see the exhibition in prison.
It may be a coincidence that Manning spent his seventh year in military prison in Kansas.
In addition, there is another dimension to this exhibition... because in contemporary America, the Trump administration is constantly declaring war on government informers and transgender soldiers, while looking for new ways in which it can be fired on Twitter to rouse division nakedly, which this exhibition is about to bridge.
. . . . . . . . . . . . when asked all this particular time, Heather Dewey Haborg said, "Anything happens for a reason."
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's super-sized signature is below (the "i" of the name is painted with a heart) and calls for an end to "the bickering of parties based on gender, sexual orientation and culture."
The opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, written with pencil twists Cs, Gs and As symbols.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, a complex dictionary of science for each artist), Heather Dewey Haborg wanted to express, at least in the physiological structure, that's the case for everyone by depicting these strangely similar portraits.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I wanted people to get out of this dilemma, and our genome would not care about who we are, how the open genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is " . . Hessedudway Haborg said that his 2007 video work " false memory" is also on display.
"DNA data can tell us many different stories, so it's 30 of them."
The last piece in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in a novel in the previous illustration.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"I'm just afraid again, and I'm still going to say it. "
Manning has not seen the exhibition herself, as foreseen in the comic, but when she does, she will be cheered by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters at the center of the gallery.

"In the past, I hung them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a group of people." Dewey? Hagburg, talking about portraits, said.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters who followed Chelsea, just as people were protesting at the time to release her. "
Professor Northwestern University and Oxford University staff are wanted for homicide.
The police say that a man was found fatally stabbed in a fancy apartment in Chicago and that a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted and are currently looking for suspects throughout the country.
The Cook County Court records indicate that on Monday, 42-year-old Windham Lesem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested without bail for the murder of Trenton H. James Connell Durranlo in connection with his death.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The community alarm released by the Chicago Police Department stated that the body had been found on July 27.
The police arrived at Grand Plaza's apartment on the phone and found several fractures on the victim's body.
The police say that Cornell Durranlo died instantly, and the detective is investigating the murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
. . . . . . Lysem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, Alan K. Kaubech, Deputy Chief of the Campus Relations Service, said that Lesem was now separated and had been banned from the Northwestern University campus.
" Now this is a criminal case, the authorities are investigating it, and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In an e-mail statement, the spokesperson for the University of Oxford Somerville College stated, " We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist the United States investigative agencies as needed. "
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped that he would surrender himself.
The Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Gullmi, expressed strong encouragement to the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
According to Gullermi, "the police have a general idea of their whereabouts, and we are trying to locate the possible location."
According to Gullermi, local, regional and national authorities are doing their utmost to assist in the search of suspects.
According to Gullermi, the police received a call from the manager of Grand Plaza's apartment, who had just received a secret tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police said the situation was terrible.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He said that according to the security cameras, it was confirmed that Lesem and Warren were in the building.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . we believe that Professor Laisem has a certain relationship with the victim," said Gullermi.
Grand Plaza ' s management team issued a statement to residents stating: " Police are currently studying the victim ' s timing and context of the crime and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident. "
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said, "We will complete the road map for the world's anti-doping institutions in the near future."
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Vitaly Mutko, said that it would not take too long to implement the remaining criteria for the restoration of the rights of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The above-mentioned statement was made by Deputy Prime Minister Mutko when he commented on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency road map, Compliance, which sets out the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights, and was recently published on the organization's website.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He added, "Everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be submitted to the IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future. "
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that the Russian anti-doping agency must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard MacKaylen on the WADA incident of Russian state support for the use of doping in national sports.
Turning to the matter, Mutko said, "We're investigating, and our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.

No one plans to accept the report unconditionally," said Smirnov.
In 2015, following the November doping scandal, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to carry out doping checks on Russian territory.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
The Director-General of WADA, Olivia Negri, said during his visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July that RUSADA was "going in the right direction" in an effort to restore its rights.

I don't have to buy any more! The 8,000 products are zero-tariff.
In a routine press conference held by the Department of Commerce on 11 January, the Department's press spokesman peaked that, as of now, 15 free trade agreements had been implemented in our country, covering 23 countries and territories, covering more than 8,000 zero-tariff imported products.
At the same time, import cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, ASEAN tropical fruits... you don't need to buy these products for a lot of money.
At present, our country has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and territories, 15 of which have entered into force and cover more than 8,000 zero-tariff imported products.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of FTAs, consumers can taste agricultural products of good quality and affordable quality from different production sites for four seasons a year.
. For example, tropical fruits such as ASEAN durians, gills, fire dragon nuts, and import duties are reduced from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
Iceland's salmon import duty is reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
In the case of wine in Georgia and Chile, the import duty was reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
There are also significant tax reductions for specialty agricultural products such as beef and milk powder in New Zealand.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, the import duty on partial cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero;
(b) Some of the watch import tariffs have been reduced by 50 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
In Korea, import tariffs on products such as refrigerators, cuisine pans, massage machines and beauty salons have been reduced by 40 per cent and will be reduced to zero tariffs after a few years;
There are also substantial tax reductions in consumer electronics and so on.
At the same time, zero-tariff products under the Free Trade Zone also include the intermediate products and raw materials required for the manufacture of many domestic end consumer goods, which also contribute to some degree to the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods.
The press spokesman for the Department of Commerce, at his peak, said that nearly one third of our total imports were eligible for preferential tariffs under the FTA, most of which were end consumer goods, with tangible benefits for consumers.
Further reduction of tariffs on imports of consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, our country has adjusted import tariffs on some consumer goods to further reduce import tariffs on consumer goods, covering food, health care, medicines, sunbursts, clothing and shoe hats, domestic equipment, cultural entertainment, and daily grocery products, involving 187 8-bit tax numbers.
The average tax rate on this consumer will be reduced from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost "stopping"!
Since 1 January 2018, our country has also partially adjusted other import and export tariffs.
(b) The tariffs on imported cosmetics, such as lipstick, eye shadows and perfume, were reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;

A Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident in Northern California, said that he had purchased an accelerated distribution service for a site twice, and $4 at a time, but that it had not been delivered on time on both occasions.
And then he applied for a refund, and he didn't get a response.
There is a better refund policy for large malls or shopping malls.
- Macy's, most of the merchandise, is refunded in full within 180 days.
But the goods must remain "original" and require purchase vouchers such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there is no certificate, the customer can also get the mall credits, which can be used to purchase other goods.

It's a great shopping experience. A new era of mall shopping is coming.
More than a decade ago, our country was generally in the seller's market, with limited choices and limited demand.
However, after a decade of development, the market has long been transformed from a seller's to a buyer's market, and today's consumer tastes have become worse, and they are no longer content with a simple "one-hand delivery" of shopping.
As a result, how to get consumers a great shopping experience became the next point of competition for real estate developers.

In Chongqing, Long Lake built the Recabin Water Loop, planning 100-side businesses, planning to introduce in the future more than 50 international top-selling flagship stores, over 100 international top brands and over 500 prominent domestic and international brands to form a service industry complex, with well-themed commercial centres.
Not only that, the Recabin Water Loop also integrates ecology into the building, with TOD-oriented public transport, a collection of fashion shopping, life services, meals, entertainment, education, sports, and, while bringing great shopping experience to consumers, leads them to enjoy Chongqing's unique "waterfront culture", integrating shopping with water entertainment, and leisure perfectly.

So while meeting the consumer's need to eat and drink and buy a one-stop substance, maximizing the multi-layered spiritual need to transmit culture and art, and fulfilling the habitable residential need, are necessarily high points in the future development of the business circle.
In Chongqing, the North Shojiang Mountain of Guo Xing is located in the north of the river, close to the sound-watch bridge, the world's commercial finery, the international giants around the world, and the first-class brands have come together, close to international fashion.

The Dragon Lake Loch No. 1, close to Chongqing's first low-density waterfront mall — Recabin Water Loop, surrounded by nine parks, low densities and high openness in commercial neighborhoods — makes people more willing to stay and stay and stay and enjoy the pleasure of shopping slowly than to be rushed forward by the people behind, making "walk shopping" really happen.
Today's commercial competition will only increase, and how to kill a bloodline in a highly homogenous market, taking away the fame of the "shopping sanctuary" in the hearts of future consumers, deserves serious reflection by all real estate developers.
The strategy of differentiation alone is far from enough, and only those developers who really put consumers in their hearts, rush consumers, think consumers, and provide consumers with extreme and simple shopping experiences can laugh in the markets of the storm.

In particular, after the start of the Double 11, a three-minute skycat deal broke 10 billion, more than $20 billion in six minutes and 05 seconds, and 10 billion in nine hours.
This day, the total number of payments made by global consumers through the payment of treasures reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over last year.
These consumptions will bring in 812 million logistics orders.

A decade ago, no one would have thought that the subculture of the single youth, created out of self-criticism, would be taken up by the electrician as a two-to-one shopping carnival on November 11.
On November 11, 2009, for the first time, Alibaba used the marketing boulder promotion: no one was in love with you, so the "single dogs" came online to buy it.

There are a lot of electricists who sell it with the Wind Cat Two Eleven, the strongest of which is Kyuto.

The environmental problems posed by instant mass consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua's daily telegraph, the usual standard of 0.2 kg per box in the industry is conservatively estimated to produce at least 300,000 tons of garbage during this year's Double 11.
The director of the Pollution Control Project of the Greenpeace East Asia Division, Liu Hua, told the Mid-Outer Dialogue that this year the order volume of the Double 11 Skycats alone generated 160,000 tons of packaged garbage.
In 2016, the National Postal Service issued a report indicating that the number of fastwares during the "Two Eleven" period (11-16 November) in 2015 was about 780 million, using more than 3 billion knitting bags, 9,922 million wrapping boxes, 16,985 million m duct tape, and tape lengths could bypass the Earth's equator by 425 laps.
And this year, the National Post Office expects a "two-to-one" fast-load operation to be expected to exceed 1.5 billion.
The manager of a waste burning centre in Beijing told Xinhua that the amount of garbage entering daily after the Double 11 was over 2,000 tons and exceeded the capacity of the treatment station.
The express delivery company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry cannot be underestimated.
Some electrician logistics enterprises, including Suning, introduced recyclable reusable plastic delivery boxes before "double 11", which could be repeated as recycled bags for shopping bags and garbage bags, but troublesome consumers were less receptive.
The Mayun also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" in microblogs.
The microblogging yielded more than 68,000 "Zong".
What kind of mobile payment does the Germans want?
Zhang Winter Fang: The mobile payment field in Germany is not expected.
We believe that the payment and the payment of the treasure have only moved the battlefield to Europe, that the competitors have not changed, that the taking of positions has not changed — the Chinese, that is globalization?
There's a place to pay the treasure, and there's got to be a micro-credit payment.
In accordance with the agreement with Wirecard, an electronic payment service provider in Germany, the micro-letter payment officially started landing in Germany in November of this year and gradually was programmed by businesses in the European context.
This exotic encounter between the two "old folks" took place in Europe.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . on the path of globalization.
In response to the globalization of mobile payments in China, Erie consulted on the study of the Chinese third-party mobile payment industry, 2017, which concluded that the first was through strategic investment, empirical output, equity entry and support for home-grown mobile payment enterprises abroad.
The second is the promotion of mobile payment services to foreign merchants through Chinese tourists ' consumption behaviour abroad, thus changing the perception and acceptance of foreign natives ' mobile payments to China.
It's true, the Chinese have to be the world's best.
The rapid economic development of China, combined with the large population base, has made it an attractive figure for Chinese tourists in Europe.
This time in Germany, the Chinese Mobile Paying Bureau was not expected.
Wikinews paid off and paid for the treasures were simply moving the battlefield to Europe, the competitors remained the same, the positions seized remained the same — or the Chinese — and that was globalization?
A more ground-breaking exploration is whether China ' s mobile payments can expand its soil on its own soil in Europe.
Take Germany, for example.
It's a magic "new retail."
Qiang Chen, Yang Kai-hyun: Amazon announces his entry into the military bookstore and grocery store as he squeezes into the world's top 10 retailers, and both timing and motivation are worth playing with.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first entity bookstore in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened shopfronts in New York and plans to have at least eight shopfronts by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, Amazon announced that the no-man supermarket (Amazon Go) under the flag would be run on a trial basis, that customers would not have to wait in line or close their books, enter the door code, take the goods they wanted and leave, and that the purchase would automatically be deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
In the case of Amazon, it's been a very unexpected thing in recent years to suddenly move on top of a real store.
Because, as early as 2007, in the Open Letter to Shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized that Amazon would not open an entity store easily unless the following four conditions were met at the same time:
1. We must be convinced that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investment;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great importance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4. We must be sure that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differences.

On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunming Conference, Mayun, Chairman of the board of directors of Ali Baba, gave a keynote address.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . from next year on, Ali Baba will no longer speak of 'e-commerce'
The era of pure electricians will soon come to an end, and the next decade, twenty years, will be free of e-commerce, replaced by ‘new retail'.
The combination of offline and logistics will produce new retail sales. "
At one point, the word "new retail" was as if magic had been applied and was frequently hung by the industry.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In 2016, after tracking 180 of the largest electricians, eMarketer estimated that their total sales was about $200 billion, of which the largest 25 accounted for more than $159 billion.
of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers (e.g. Macy department stores, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.) who only started operating on the line in the last five years.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On a global scale, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to a full-source retail system covering physical stores, electricians, mobile ends and socialized media.
Is Mayunti's "new retail" more a wrap-up than a vision for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole-channel concept and "new retail"?
Maybe, the key to the problem is not whether the line and the line will merge, but how.
Looking back at the last 20 years of retailing, the rise of electricists, like the rise of early discount retailers, has focused on prices and facilitation.

In the words of Aribaba CEO Zhang Yong, " the use of the ideas and technologies of the Internet to overhaul and upgrade the total number of existing social retailers of about 30 trillion makes it possible to effectively meet the rising consumer demand of Chinese consumers, making the entire process of producing, circulating, and serving goods more efficient because of the Internet, the widespread use of big data.

On 18 January, Alibaba convened an electrician summit dialogue in Chongqing to lift out of poverty, announcing the promotion of precision out of poverty and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of "Internet+ Eradicating Poverty".
This was the "plus" of Ali's fight against poverty, following the presentation of a rural strategy, the launch of the Rural Treasure Project, the up-line Shinnon Poverty Reduction Platform and the establishment of the Ali Baba Poverty Eradication Fund.
The fight against poverty is one of the most important national strategies in China at this time.
The full eradication of poverty has never been achieved in China in the last few thousand years.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . is an innovative initiative for a new round of pro-poor development.
The Centre attaches great importance to, and notes, the role that the Internet can play in helping lift out poverty, advancing accurate poverty alleviation, accurate poverty alleviation, and bringing agricultural products out of the countryside through the Internet. "
As a result, Ali presented a village strategy as early as 2014, along with large data cloud computing and globalization, and was listed as the three core strategies of Ali for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Treasures (Villagins) Project to recruit "The Village Two" in the countryside, leading farmers out of poverty through electricists.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to build a channel for poverty alleviation in Hinnon, which is now cumulatively aligned with 13 provinces and 120 national-level poor counties across the country.
There are already 2118 treasure-hunting villages stemming from the Ali platform.
Of these, nearly 400 appear in poor districts in the provinces and 33 in poor counties in 13 countries.
In 2017, on the Ali Baba Chinese retail platform, the national sales of treasure-seeking villages amounted to $120 billion.
Zhang Yong said that, in the face of a strong national strategy to fight poverty, Ali had been thinking about how to move out of a new path to poverty with innovative capabilities such as good technology, big data, cloud computing, etc. in the Ali economy.
Among them, village hunting is the main carrying platform for Ali electricians to lift themselves out of poverty and to walk through a new Internet route to lift themselves out of poverty for direct marketing.
In the planting chain, village hunting and ant gold suits jointly support farming tools and microcredit.
In 2017, in 832 poor counties at the national level, ants' gold suits served 795 persons, providing them with easy payment, credit, etc.

The development of electricity producers out of poverty requires not only products, marketing channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . through the introduction of the University of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
These courses have covered about 92 per cent of poor counties at the national level.
The "public interest mentality, business instruments" approach to poverty eradication also guarantees that Ali is "real poverty-reducing" when it comes to poverty reduction.
The Chairman of the board of directors of Ali Baba, Mayun, had said that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and wealth creation.

The pro-poor industry, driven by the electrician, is the making of fish ponds.
In terms of industrial poverty reduction, the Lorchuan Apple Industry Poverty Alleviation Model, which Ali worked with Shaanxi Lochuan, has been replicated and replicated throughout the country as an example by the authorities concerned.

A number of village minions and ant gold suit employees were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of electricians in lifting out of poverty.
At present, the United Nations World Food Programme China office has been working with villages to alleviate poverty in the electric industry in places such as Anhui.
The Third Congress of New Economic Thinkers, co-sponsored by the Ali Institute, China's Visionary Think Tank Theory, was held on 16 January and was attended by and spoke to Zhang Li, Director of the Electronics Institute of the Ministry of Commerce.
She believes that our globalization really ignores the most important issues, namely, the body and use of globalization, and the stages of globalization.
This way many people think that globalization is stagnating, and that many developed and developing countries, in a new phase, have different attitudes towards globalization and are different from models.
The second concept was the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, to which the medium-term phase of globalization was subject.
It is because of the globalization of changes in the economic base that constraints have occurred.

"It's no use saying so much about these relationships, and finally implementing whether you've brought a good experience to the consumer, and I've experienced it before I'm willing to pay for it. "
The new retail environment saw a change in consumer habits and a change in the demand for purchases.

The analysis concluded that the current competition for new retail sales in front-line cities was far from reaching the Red Sea pattern, with large areas of second-line cities yet to be excavated and markets still have significant opportunities and space.
The layout of new retailing in different types of industries will bring the development of new retailing into a diversified state of development.

For a start-up company like Glint, the company's desire for supervision is a moneyless business opportunity.
According to the Financial Technology Analysis website Let's Talk Payments, by 2020 the value of the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.7 billion.
The start-up company in Denver, Colorado, Convercent was committed to helping the company prevent and detect bad behavior, and they saw an increase in interest and activity in this area during the loss of their reputation for the good steps earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Eppei, Microsoft and Tesla.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "diagnosis" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view hot maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous texting hotlines for employees to report misconduct.
If the chairman is implicated, then the complaint will go directly to the board.
The founder and CEO of Convercent, Patrick Quinlan, said, "The Court of Public Opinion usurped the powers of the regulatory body.
If a company is found to treat employees poorly or to behave immorally towards employees, even if the regulatory body does not intervene, the company may face the high consequences of consumer resistance, staff loss and involvement in litigation, Quinlan says.
The Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain that spans over 500 places and has over 25,000 employees, has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of work guidelines and work protocols and provide easy access to corporate headquarters.
Before that, if the employee wants to report the problem, he must find the company's headquarters phone number or e-mail, make a formal complaint and hope that the headquarters will take it seriously.
This is often a fearsome and disturbing experience, with Ruby Tuesday's legal adviser, James Vitrano, as he said, he does not think there is a good way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, it will be able to identify and resolve more quickly problems previously unknown to executives located in remote offices, cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I could be closer, 360 degrees full of work experience," said Vitrano, who was responsible for Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment lawsuits. "
Quinlan said that after the closure of Andorran accounting firms due to the Enron scandal that violated ethical norms, companies began to place greater emphasis on ethics, values and employee professionalism in 2002.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . before using technology to monitor morality, people see hope as a strategy," he said.

This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors, who have supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, whose total capital rose to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total of $60 million.
In view of the interconnectedness of corporate, cultural and venture investments, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing body of research shows that employees today have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In a highly competitive market like Silicon Valley, high-paying and interesting projects are just bets.
The employees want to feel they are accepted, valued, and feel that their time is spent in a company with an active mission.

NCAA cancels training twice a day and extends the Bears' daytime training time.
At 11 o'clock, the UCLA football team members wandered around and chatted next to the team's new campus practice field.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts and exposed the first day of the training camp trying to train post-sweet bodies.
For a large part of the team, this spare few minutes is rest time.
The players attending the summer course will return to the dormitory for the final exam after three hours of practice, and then the next morning at 6:30 a.m. to the Wasserman Football Center for the conference.
- "The next three days are a grind for these guys," said Bears coach Jim Mora on Monday, who is about to enter Tuesday.
The NCAA cancelled the practice twice a day (with the aim of reducing the burden on players), but actually extended their daytime training time - at least by the end of Friday.
This is why the first three trainings at UCLA are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the schedule where players have been squeezed.
The Bears conducted training almost a week before the previous season, from canceling training twice a day to conducting more one-day training, and Mora first trained at Summer School in six seasons in Westwood.

. . . . . . in three or four days, we'll put a huge amount of training on them, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"They're just passing. They're grinding, they're all great kids.
I think by Saturday we'll have more time. It's really great. "
As soon as the training camp is over, the University of California, Los Angeles, will cease training. This is not an easy task, given the proximity of parking lots and the clear view of Luskin Center.
This weekend, the Bears will be staying at the hotel. But Mora admits that once these rooms are vacant during the season, problems may arise.
"We'll take security measures," said Mora.
The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in the room to record training scenes is not far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures in parking lot 8.
We'll use the available resources to do the best we can.
I wouldn't worry too much about that.
We've already made a plan. "

Facebook will launch a fact-checking feature to counter false news.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that more potential prank articles would be sent to third-party detection agencies and that the results would be displayed below the original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, was trying to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, Facebook stated that Facebook would begin to use newer machines to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to fact-checkers, and might show fact-check results below the original post.
The Facebook has been criticized as one of the main transmission points of the so-called fake news, and many believe Facebook has influenced the 2016 United States presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, where voters experienced a proliferation of false stories before the May presidential election in France, and Germany, which took the lead in adopting support for a fines scheme before the September election, will be fined if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in a timely manner.
On Thursday, Facebook stated in a separate German statement that a new fact-checking functional test was being initiated in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
The Facebook news feed product manager Sarah Sue, in a blog, said, "In addition to seeing which stories are being questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more background to help them make informed decisions about what to read and share.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "relevant articles" feature and make other changes to its news synopsis to reduce false news.

This is not Roz's first book with an archive as a raw material: he also wrote "The teeth and other stories of the 2014 dead", a book inspired by the literature of the British Library, a work he did by the passion of creation beyond his control.
He said, "I can't contain my writing impulses from the moment I saw the thumb mark left on the side of the letter, which was written by a dual agent who worked for the Jacobite in the 18th century."
"That's his fingerprints!
And the letters always smelled like smoke, because then you needed to light up.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes people feel like they're with us.
Oh, I love the archive!"
For those who are moved by old paper, they can count on the support of the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and have lived in the castle for almost four months ("I've been a little long," to be honest"), which seems wonderful, and I can't believe it's true.

The story of the book, titled Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, recorded a riot that took place in the castle in 1380," said Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in that area, and I think it's a good place to start the uprising.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the period of religious reform in England.
or The Smuggler, the owner of the story was Arthur Darrell, an 18th-century smuggler who was thought to have given himself a funeral by filling his coffin with stones (it was only a few years later that his coffin appeared on the ground that people noticed).
The Darrells are Roz's favorite Scottney Castle family: "These gentlemen seem to be rogue and always borrow money and pay for what they can't afford.
A generation after generation Darrell men solve their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I think they should be a group of handsome young men who know how to pursue women. "

All large energy companies are "rich and powerful," so who among the world's many energy companies is taking the most money?

According to PFC statistics, however, although the current oil prices are much higher than they were four years ago, the PFC Energy Corporation CEO noted that there are many reasons for the low total market value, mainly the decline in gas prices in North America and the low level of activity in the global stock market.

United States changes to green card regulations
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that the United States would launch a new immigration plan and modify the Green Card regulations.
The plan meant to reduce legal migration to 50,000 persons per year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications would be subject to stricter regulations.
The new provisions were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both houses.
The United States media quoted Trump as saying, "The law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and realize these benefits by changing the way the United States distributes green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will replace the current programme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process facilitates English speaking, financial support, and skills for economic development ... "

In order to optimize the landscape environment and build beautiful Nam Yue, in recent days, the South Yue District Tobacco Office (subdivision) "636" Volunteer Service carried out the environmental activities of Mounting Forest, Love Home.
The event was supported not only by the entire cadres of the District Tobacco Authority, but also by the participation of retired seniors, family members of workers in environmental practices, three generations of young people working together, climbing the forest, cleaning up the garbage, and devoting their share of power to the construction of the Beautiful Nanjiao.
The purpose of this volunteer campaign is to protect the South Yue landscape resources, promote the concept of volunteerism "to care for others, to care for society, to love nature", and to enable the next generation to embrace the virtues of volunteerism from an early age.
It is known that since its inception in early April of this year, the "636" Volunteering Brigade has had 16 development members, successively carrying out a series of volunteer activities such as looking at disabled retail clients, helping smokers care for tobacco leaves, and Yaan earthquake love donations, to become a volunteer force that carries positive energy with heart.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful.
Just when you thought 2017 wouldn't be weirder, the sex robot field released a new technical development report.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the Responsible Robot Foundation (FRR) released a report that looks forward to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel, Professor Emeritus of Robotic Technology and Artificial Intelligence and co-founder of FRR at Sheffield University? Shaki says we need to start taking seriously the emergence of sex robots.
The customer can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the nipple shape and the nail type.
"People laugh behind their backs, but the big companies do launch a lot of sex robots, and we'll see more."
The modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots, with silicone skin, touching warmth, and deliberately using artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual reactions.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But even more disturbing is that many robots with "personality" will make "replicate wife" look advanced.
The modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skins.
For example, RealBotix robots are able to come from definitions based on characteristics that users consider attractive, such as shyness.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

That's why she loves what you love and hates what you do.
She had little emotions in those days, just like normal people!
She can be lazy, talkative, or ‘sexually dynamic'!"
The rise of sex robots has caused much anxiety — not only as a substitute for true human relations — but also the feminine characteristic of the low knee and the hint of rape drawn on cold (read: resistance) Fara is the most worrying.
True Companion compares Roxxy to a man's vibrating stick on its website.
The site says, "If a woman has a vibrating stick, then why can't a man have a roxxy?"
The sex robots, however, are not a mere lover, nor are they just a sex toy.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the edge of consumer culture.
But what comes from the permeation of the edge allows us to see the process of the era in which we are living.
A lot of people weren't weird or aggressive until the free market gave them the chance to be like this.
It is no coincidence that these fine sex robots appear in an era in which the rights of women around the world are threatened and that there is a president in the White House who boasts about sexual violence against women.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the most timid part of the TV show The Story of the Enchanted Woman is not in the picture, not in that hanging body, nor in that pair of unearthed eyes, but in that overreal imagination.
The Republic of Kilead is a leap, but it doesn't look so far away now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create, as technically as possible, the most female-like body (although by sex star ratio).
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and imitate real human action.
But in plain terms, their "personality" does not represent the real woman.
They can't break up, they can't run away.
They have no recourse agencies and no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking the illusion of complete slavery.
In other words, they're fun slaves.
Or according to the common saying of 2017: the handmaiden.

Trump's great feat?
Let Mitt Romney be the microcosm of common sense.
The political divide has led to polarization among American voters, while, from a micro-level point of view, it has undermined American family harmony, which is no surprise to the Trump era.
. . . . . . . . before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, the major newspapers in the United States were filled with comments about how to deal with the fear of choosing Trump's relatives.

I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, has long been dissonant with the Republicans in our home, and he is coming to New York to visit me this week.
She reminds me that uniting against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
As a result of working with Trump at the White House, all the people she knew, even the relatives of Republicans who had been in political strife for decades, are now suddenly and strangely on the same front.
If it's all at the table, it's certainly a good thing, but I'm shocked that, from a broader point of view, it can lead to significant risks.

I find myself a little eccentric about Mitt Romney's recent edition: putting dogs on the car, 14% of the income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and the crimes of these two moves do seem to be too minor compared to Trump.

When my cousin lived in town, we took our children to the New York Park's spin-off horse, the largest to be run by the New York Central Park administration, and if you don't need coffee, these three-dollar tickets are your most consumer value in this city.

If I could evaluate the carousel, I'd give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.

The poor woman at the department store smiled with regret, while I was exhausted and the credit card trading experience gave her five stars.

Two Bulgarians detained for illegal camping in Greece
. bTV quotes from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, the Cisonia police detained a group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed to the bTV that the two Bulgarians were subsequently released.

On 18 May, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Mechanism for Managing the Special Award for the Structural Adjustment of Industrial Enterprises", which will arrange for a special award supplement to promote the removal of coal, the excess capacity of the steel industry, for a total amount of $100 billion.
In recent times, several local governments, such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Heilongjiang, have submitted reforms to address excess capacity.
Among them, many provinces even offered to actively seek the financial support of the central treasury for the de-productivity of their provinces.
One indication is that the declared coal de-energy target in only eight provinces stands at 90 per cent of the national coal reduction plan.
In an interview with a journalist, Limberjian, President of the Chinese Institute of Energy Policy at Xiamen University, argued that the "de-production capacity" of the steel and coal industries was far from enough, with more funding needed from local governments and businesses.
The recently published code for coal decapitation in Shanxi Province proposes that the Shanxi Coal Group be reorganized into a State-owned capital investment company, that the assets and operations of the enterprise be reorganized and that a brand new business model be built.
The actual funding gap may have been three times greater than the subsidy before, when the Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, Yoon Ulming, said that the initial count of the "de-capable" employee coal system to be diverted was 1.3 million people and the steel system was 500,000.

Does meat, dairy and chocolate help to alleviate inflammatory intestine disease (IBD)?
The meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in your digestive system.
But a new study showed the opposite: diets rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the associated symptoms in people with inflammatory intestines.
The incurable disease has a life impact of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British, leading to stomach cramps and abdominal swelling, recurrent or hemorrhagic diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
. Researchers at the University of Washington usually recommend that patients avoid eating meat and dairy products to mitigate symptoms, but researchers find that proteins' key amino acid-coloured amino acids help to promote immunocell growth, which enhance the endurance of the intestinal tract.
The chief researcher, Marco Colonna, explained that immunocellular cells would patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food did not sneak into the body.

. . . . . . . . . a cell that promotes immunity was found in mice carrying special bacteria.
c. Bacteria need chromate (one of the components of proteins) to form the appearance of the cell.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between a bacterium population (Roy's milk bacterium, which is a normal part of the intestinal microbial community) and a population of cells that can contribute to the development of endurance.
The more chromatic amino acid the mice in their diet, the more immune cells they have.

A postdoctoral researcher, Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, studied an immune cell that enhances endurance, when she discovers that a group of research mice have such cells, but not when another group of the same strain is separately raised.
She suspects that this difference is related to the intestinal microbes of mice (meaning bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice found that 6 bacterial populations were present in mice with immunocytes, but not in mice with no immunocytes.

. In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivate rubella in liquids and then transfer small amounts of bacteria-free liquids to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immunocellular cell develops into a resistant cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be shown to be a by-product of chromate metabolism, known as gill-3-lactic acid.
The number of such cells increased by about 50 per cent when researchers doubled the amount of chromatic amino acid in the rat feed, but when the level of chromatic amino acid was halved, the number of cells was reduced by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people, like rats, have the same cell that enhances endurance, and that most of us have luclactus in our gastrointestinal tract.
Whether humans, like mice in the experiment, can induce the development of the cell by-products of chromate from the Luxil milk bacterium, is not currently known, but genetic defects related to chromate have been found in patients with inflammatory intestines.
She said, "The development of these cells may be exactly what we want because they control the inflammation response on the inside of the intestine surface.
It may be inaccurably stated that the high level of chromatic amino acid present in the Lucifer Bacillus may lead to an increase in the number of this species.

If China doesn't build this type of warship, will China be behind?
With the recent announcement by the world's major naval powers of plans for the construction of new types of frigates, as if overnight the frigates had become the focus of attention by the naval forces of the great Powers, first of all by Japan's decision to procure two new types of frigates in its 2018 defence budget, which had finally led to a substantial breakthrough in the Japanese DEX frigate plan, and then by the recent announcement by Lockheed Martin of the latest programme of the United States' FFG frigate plan, where would China's new frigate come from?
With the fall of one of the latest Type 054A frigates in late 2017, marking the construction of up to 29 frigates, it has approached the sum of the 053H series of frigates, while the construction of 054A has been in progress for 12 years since the first 054A was laid down in 2006, and the construction of such a large number of high-performance general frigates worldwide, with the exception of China, only the "Perry" class frigates built by the United States in the 7th, 80th century can be compared.
And the reason why so many 054As are built is simple, and that's what's good for you, and that's why it's added to years of naval debt.
The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years with a high value and good fighting power, with about 4,000 tons of drainage, a drop-off system carrying a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of sea red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missiles, and 8 eagle strikes 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although it was a ship that began construction in 2006 and was designed earlier, but even if it was put in a bad way today, it could reach a moderate level among the world's escorts.
But this is, after all, a Type I ship designed in the early 21st century, equipped with weapons, whose power systems and electronic radar equipment are already very different from the current world mainstream frigates, as European frigates of the same type are already equipped with full-electric propulsion, small multi-functional phase-control radars, large-sized helicopter decks, and the time has come to develop a new type.
So how China's new frigate should be developed is directly related to its future positioning and strategic approach to our Chinese Navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will certainly become a Bluewater Navy, and the future will also be a journey towards the ocean, with rapid deployment in areas of vital interest to China, showing the existence of force and, if necessary, strong fighting power to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged.
Look again at the positioning of new types of frigates in future Chinese naval sequences, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to that of the United States Navy, with the exception of the necessary offshore defensive ships, the main ships would form carrier combat groups or amphibious strike groups, as required by the circumstances.
The role of the new frigate should serve as the main anti-submarine force in future carrier combat groups and as the emptiness of the near-middle area, and in the amphibious attack ship strike group as a frigate class, so that the need for the new frigate to have a strong anti-submarine capability and a good medium-range area emptiness capability.
On the basis of the above-mentioned positioning, it is possible to boldly envisage the approximate shape of a future national frigate.
First of all, there will be a significant increase in drainage compared to the current Type 054A frigate, estimated to be about 5000-6000 tons for new frigates; the power system will use an integrated power propulsion system consisting of a QC280 improved gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed expected to be around 30 knots, and a substantial increase in the re-launching power; as for the weapons configuration 76 mm main gun and 1130 close defense gun, it will be retained, but a red flag 10 launch system will be added, with a 32-48 unit red flag 16 improvement and fish-8 co-loading system that should be fitted behind the vessel with a large 8-16 unit for the launch of the eagle and new type of cruise missile; as for the hangar and stop platform, it will be increased to reach the stop and storage of two 10-ton helicopters; and as for the electronic radar system, it will be equipped with a 32-48 unit red flag 16 improved and fish-8 co-loading system that would be similar to that developed in the European frigate.
This would bring the overall level of the new frigate to its current level of first-class in the world, even when compared to the United States FPG.
The above-mentioned concept, of course, is only a pentriff's conjecture of a new kind of frigate in the country, how exactly we can only wait until the new frigate is in the water to find out what it is, so let's expect it together.

Chinese family debt ratios are closer to the United States than if they can't afford a house.
In recent times, everyone has been discussing the recent changes in real estate policy, and is the real estate policy about to go loose again? Will the diversification of the land supply sector cause housing prices to fall?
But when we were worried about real estate prices, about macroeconomic regulation, and about future developments in the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again, and last time we devoted ourselves to People's Daily's comments on the regulation of real estate, and now the People's Daily's article deals with a more serious topic than the unaffordable one, which is whether you can afford debt even if you can afford it.
Today, let's talk about something more serious than buying a house: repaying a loan.
First, China's growing housing debt crisis
The People's Daily Overseas published a review article on 17 January entitled "Awards and Loans ... Struggling for Youth's Happiness and Care", according to which in November 2017, the Third Quarter Report on China's De-Leverage Process, issued by the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the National Centre for Balance Sheet Research, noted that the population's sector leverage rate continued to rise, rising from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter, rising by 1.3 percentage points and 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The resident sector's share of debt in the whole real economy has increased, and the leverage rate has risen faster.
. Research has shown that Chinese households' liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, about two thirds of residents' liabilities, about twice as many as operating loans.
Among these, medium- and long-term loans, dominated by housing loans, account for around 80 per cent, but in terms of volume increase, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition to this, the household debt rate in China only tallied the total amount of credit received by the household sector from financial institutions, while Chinese households had a number of private loans, including borrowing money from relatives and friends, and there were large-scale hidden debts.
Seeing this data, it's a bit of anecdotal. According to the Sunning Institute of Finance statistics, the population leverage rate in China was only 3 per cent in 1996 and 18 per cent in 2008, but has begun to grow rapidly since 2008, doubling to 36.4 per cent in just six years. By 2017, the population leverage rate had reached 48.6 per cent in the third quarter.
In another comparison, last May, HSBC Bank released a survey across nine countries, with respondents approaching tens of thousands of people.
This report is aimed at young people of the " Millennium Generation" in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report notes that 80,90 post-90 youth housing ownership in China is as high as 70 per cent, far ahead of Mexico's second (46 per cent) and twice as high as that indicator in the United States (35 per cent).
The data tell us that there is a very likely problem that is that the largest potential "grey rhinoceros" of Chinese residents at this stage is expected to be unable to pay off their debts, compared to their inability to afford housing.
Second, why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have analysed before, although we have been saying that Chinese housing prices are high, Chinese housing ownership is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world, so rather than having high housing prices, I'm afraid the question for many friends now is whether you can afford a loan?
As we look at real estate markets around the world, China's real estate market, due to its late start, has not experienced an excessive real estate crisis, except for Hainan, which we said earlier, but the origin of the 2008 worldwide financial tsunami just a decade ago was the real estate crisis in the United States.
The reason for the real estate crisis in the United States was attributed to the two houses: Lilimy and Emeritus.
In the golden age of the United States, when real estate companies sold the house to low-income people in the United States with extremely low down payment in order to expand their sales, the real estate market was also booming when the United States economy was better, yet the good news was not long, and as growth in the United States stalled, causing the purchaser's income to decline, so large amounts of household consumption expenditure began to decline.
However, the current situation in the United States at that time was a component of the financial and real estate assets of United States household assets, with almost all of the household assets of the low-income group in the United States being real estate, while most of the assets of the top 20 per cent of the high-income group were financial assets, resulting in higher debt rates for the poorer housing properties in the United States.
The serious fact is that these people are all houses bought at a time of better economics, so the money paid for the mortgage is also calculated in terms of their better income, and when the income goes down, the pressure on the mortgage not only does not decrease, but even as some subprime schemes become more floating, so the real estate problems of these American families have gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
As a result, the banks began to take back the property because their income was too low to pay for the mortgage, and when the bank took back the property from the buyer who was in arrears, they would sell it at very low prices, which would lead to a gradual decline in housing prices in the region, a process that in turn triggered a further decline in housing prices, creating a vicious circle where more and more buyers found that their house was worth even less than their own loans, so that more people stopped paying back their mortgages and caused more bad debts.
Thus, a huge vicious circle emerges:
"The economy is depressed — income is down — some people can't afford to pay their mortgages — the bank sells the houses of the debtors — the house falls — more people stop paying back the mortgages — the bank sells again — and the house prices fall again..."
The problem is more than that, because the price of the house continues to fall, and it's not like you don't have any debt after everyone stops paying the house to the bank, and if the money you owe the bank to auction the house is still not on the bank's loan, then you still need to pay back, simply assuming that you bought a house worth $3 million with the initial payment of $600,000, $2.4 million with the loan, and when the house fell to only $2 million, you don't pay the house to the bank, the bank auction house, you lose your first payment of $600,000, you owe the bank $400,000, and you still have to pay back the money.
So, in such a vicious circle, the United States economy gradually collapsed, culminating in the 2008 financial crisis in the United States.
So the high level of 46.8 per cent of China's household debt rate at this stage is a matter of great caution, and this figure is still below the developed countries' level at present, but the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly stressed the issue of deleveraging since last year, which is a very priori judgement that a household debt rate, if allowed to continue rising, would inevitably pose a great risk, so that financial risks will be carefully protected.
So with the house then being used to live, not for job placement, the State has accelerated the establishment of a multi-subject supply, multi-channel security, and multiple measures such as rent-purchases, to further address potential risks.
For our individual families, it is important to give up real estate speculation, buy the house in a way that is affordable and avoid a huge burden on their families, and that only a reasonable assessment of their income and level of indebtedness is a healthy path to family wealth development.

President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibit was a Connecticut-made helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the Force Marine Helicopter First Flight (HMX-1), which operates the helicopter, the White House Military Office asked the helicopter to appear on a daily order (FRAGO) for only 36 hours before landing on the south lawn to participate in this "special" event.
The day before the event, the HMX-1 commander, in an e-mail sent to the higher Marine Corps flight deputy commander, said, "I just want to confirm that you know because this event is highly valued. "
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive on the south lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 for the event at 3 p.m. and will not leave until 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. The lawn is cleared.
The information also indicates that in the event of a delay in the departure from the White House, the return flight would require a second crew due to time constraints on duty.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . while the original crew was standing by the helicopter during the activity, while the security forces were standing by nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
The records obtained by Time magazine do not clearly indicate whether the second crew will ultimately be needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record indicates that HMX-1 had asked if the event had violated the Act.
The commander wrote, "The question we ask is whether this is a violation of the Hatch Act and was told that there was no violation. "
"Sounds you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The White House defined this "U.S. manufacturing" activity as an official activity and was therefore not governed by the Hatch Act.
But even official activities are politically coloured.
At the event, the President pursued the issue of the Senate at the time: medical reform, and much of the control of government regulations.
The use of Marine Corps I or Air Force I aircraft for political propaganda purposes is no longer new.
Each president has been asked to travel by these aircraft.
But it's not common to requisition it for photographic purposes only.

The White House's deputy news spokesman, Lindsay Walters, said that "the White House is so excited by the ‘American Making' exhibition, which shows products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers using American materials."
The HMX-1 crew regularly conducts flight training near the Washington area and on the south lawn, practicing the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
In early July, while Trump was attending the G-20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The helicopter unit also flew an extra 11 hours of "non-presidential support mission" that day.
The White House side stated that the taxpayer had not borne the cost of any other props at the event.
The Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in arranging the display of the South Lawn Helicopter.
The HMX-1 does not maintain a budget record for the President's flight, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence, the cost of hours for the 2017 financial year, VH-3D's Ministry of Defence is reimbursed at $24,380 per flight hour.
The troop records recorded a time of 30 minutes each flight from the base of the Marine Corps Airport in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House has said that the cost of operating the helicopter is much lower than the cost.
. . . . . . . . Walters said that "it is very misleading to estimate the taxpayer's costs on a reimbursable basis.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sank costs included in the annual appropriations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence did not include personnel costs, but did include oil, maintenance and contractual costs.
At the time, Sean Spike, a former White House news spokesman, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
And he said, "The idea is to show what America is making this week.
And I know that Sikorsky Corporation and Connecticut are proud of it, and that they all have contributed a force to our national security, and I guess hundreds of people are dependent on it even without thousands of jobs.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the result of countless American hard work.
So, of course, it's not out of place to highlight this. "
We don't know if Trump interacts with the helicopter when he tours the South Lawn at the event, but he does sit in the driver's seat for the fire truck.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in the White House, Trump addressed a representative of Sikorsky Corporation and joked about his own company's aircraft with the media.
He said, "I know all about Sikorsky.

According to the Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, my provincial GDP rose from the central side of the "bottom of the mat" to the second seat.
But I'm still struggling with low investment efficiency and a lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy....To this end, the Provincial Economic Information Centre's latest issue of the "Economic Blue Page" recommends improving the quality and effectiveness of economic growth.
Based on some of the representative indicators of my provincial economy in 2005 and 2011, it is compared to the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011 a significant proportion of the industrial energy, raw materials, and other high-energy industries in my province were affected by market fluctuations and were "double pressured" to produce excess energy, while insufficient innovation in the dominant industries, such as home electricity and automobiles, led to marginal profits.
The fact that a large amount of investment did not bring about the corresponding economic benefits is an important reason for the poor quality and effectiveness of my economic growth.
In response, experts suggested that effective measures should be taken to encourage innovation in enterprises and that the scientific and technological results of universities and research institutes should be "transferred" to enterprises in a timely manner.
. For industrial economy, experts said that industrial merger restructuring, optimizing industry layout, and extending industrial chains would also be actively promoted.

The UK General Trade Union (GMB) is concerned about investments in the MacVitie Glasgow factory.
The union hopes that the management of the cookie manufacturer McVita will ensure a long-term commitment to production at the Lasco factory.

In a letter to the director of the company, the Scottish branch of the United Kingdom General Trade Union called on McVitall to " solve the problem of funds not being carried over to the modernization of the production line."
The senior host of the United Kingdom General Trade Union, Drew Duffy, said, "We are unable to get a clear picture from the general manager of the factory of the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcross, which is a source of deep concern to our members.
The generations of families working here, and the high concentration of labour in the local community and the Greater Glasgow region, are important pillars of decent employment in areas with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the point of view of employment, pay and economic prosperity, against the backdrop of the British de-Europeanization, rising cost of living and a long-term decline in manufacturing, the eastern region of Glasgow is in dire need of a growing production network in McVitter. "
The spokesman for Pradis said, "The director of Tollcross just received a letter yesterday from the Scottish branch of the United Kingdom General Trade Union that the company would respond immediately, as we value maintaining continuous contact with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we held regular meetings with employees and representatives of the United Kingdom General Trade Union at Tollcross, where a number of issues were discussed in public.
We had discussions with employees, and then, like all other companies operating in highly competitive and economically uncertain environments, we reviewed the continuing business model that we applied to businesses and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5 million in the Tollcross factory, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of the historic status of Tollcross as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, employees and union representatives will be the first to know. "

On May 10, environmental volunteers loaded classified garbage into trucks.
The environmental problems at the site of the summit have become more prominent as Everest climbers and tourists have increased dramatically for nearly a decade.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous Region Mounting Association launched its first clean-up campaign on the northern slopes of Everest, clearing a collection of living waste such as oxygen bottles left over from the 1960s and 1970s.The video was also shown specifically at the Tokyo World Climate Conference that year, raising world concern.

Did Paris Saint-Germain warn Barcelona three years ago to sign off on Nemar?
West Jae may regret throwing olive branches at Marco Veratti.
After a £189 million offer was made to attempt to allow it to exercise the immunity clause, St. Germain of Paris would not give up signing into Nemar, but had they warned Barcelona three years earlier that he would attack the world record raider?
This sensational approach has opened the summer transfer window, and the fascist club is ready to break the world transfer record for more than twice as much as the last transfer record. Paul Bogba returned to Manchester last season for up to £89 million.
