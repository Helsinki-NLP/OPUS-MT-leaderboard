The lead singer at Zheji's annual academic conference, the results of the study have opened up the brainholes of Xinhua.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . last night, at the opening of the 2016 Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with large brain holes was recognized.
The main researchers of these results were students, who covered the major fields of environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education, and classmates, starting with a curious idea, created many high-end inventions of applied value, some of which had been awarded international awards at the national level.
Biosensor: Your family medical examiner
The biomedicine engineering college doctoral student Zhang Dying team live shows a biosensor of a smartphone end, only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to take a little breath, and this set of instruments will make it possible to first detect the state of physical health from the gas composition you call out. "

. Smart hand rings that can detect health status on the market, typically physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
The biosensors use this new type of material, graphene, and its target is chemical elements, a keen "sniffing sense" that allows it to be more deep and accurately representative of the health of the body.
Smart Surgery Lights: Doctor's High-Early Eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgery lights are used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver prize at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland, this year.

"Many early detections of diseases, which are not in place, are related to the lamps used by the doctor ' s operating room."
. . . . . . Shin Jun Fei said that, for example, during early cancer tests, if doctors do not see all tumor tissues in time, then cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent operating lamp has four light drives, which increase the difference between different tissues in light by regulating the spectrum.
In the course of the operation, doctors can at any time regulate the size, brightness, spectroscopy, color homogeneity and no-shadow rate of light spots, depending on the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This smart operating lamp has been tested at hospitals affiliated with the University of Zhejiang School of Medicine and children's hospitals affiliated with the University of Zhejiang Medical School, and has received better feedback.
Last October, the invention was awarded the First Prize of the National Challenge Cup.

As long as we stand on the device's washstand, our weight will compress the air.
"Like a pump.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So we can wash our hands! "
. Visible reactions and bacterial residual experiments have shown that the effects of hand washing through this method are the same as those of the ordinary method of hand washing.
This device, driven only by our own gravity, ensures a cleanness and saves 90% of the water, and the whole process is completely energy-efficient and energy-efficient.
Last year, at the second Global Summit on Major Challenges, the invention came out of many of the world's top schools, winning the only gold prize.
Please arrange for me to get back to you as soon as possible, thx.

A certificate that makes sense. First aid.
This is one of the skills papers I find important in addition to my driver's license!

It is well known that there was actually some time before the ambulance came after the accident, and that's when it was the most critical.
This is the time to need first aid.
If I did have a heart attack, a brain spill, a breath stop, then the window of our lives is four minutes, four minutes gold!
That's why people around know how important it is.
When someone falls around us, we can save him through professional knowledge, rather than just standing there and doing nothing, this feeling of helplessness is so terrible.
"In China, our official data contains three million accidental deaths each year, most dangerously called heart stops.
All over the United States, it's an average of 15 per cent that can be saved.
At the Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, 78 percent can be saved, Shanghai, Beijing less than 1 percent. "
That's what Lu Lok, the founder of the first reaction, said.
If a man's heart stops, his breath is gone, his heart beats are gone, and you strangle people without any effect.
It must be artificially respirated, and the pressure outside the chest will make it possible to save people.
I find that very few of us now have this consciousness to learn first aid, but it's too late when things happen, so I'm calling on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in a timely manner in the face of sudden onset situations.
Maybe it'll save the life of a man!
First aid certificates can be registered at your local Red Cross training centre, I'm enrolled at the Red Cross training centre in Pearlhai, and students have a bonus.
PS: The last chart is a record of the goals to be achieved before the age of 25, and the addition of the first aid certificate to the target list was a few months ago, but it was done!
Then I'm going to take another test, and I'm going to take a diving pass, and I've seen a diving first aid card in a little red book, which seems to have a first aid card to do, so it's still useful.

In this insult to the audience, Han Chiu is really gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it's as if it's a creation in a novel, unnamed, and porous as a windsuit on Ponyco.
Even when you're done looking at it, you'll wonder if there's a director metaphor in it, but when you think about it, it's actually a shitload of shit.
Let's just say a little bit of a plot that I don't understand.
The man's place of residence should be on a small island in the south, dependent on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for one of the neighbors to drive a minivan to the northeast to see the snow.
The old man rides in a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father are very relieved.
Then the old man is gone.
How did her brother get a license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why would the island's motorists block a mountain road so easily?
Then the truck that delivered the steel band in the middle of the road stopped by the side of the road and could not find the truck driver around.
It's too obvious.
Why would a small, mixed-flying party be an auxiliary police officer if it was not possible and was suspected of violating the law?
Why didn't the police call the police in the face of usury?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone without knowing how to open the door with a room card in a hotel and then forcibly arrange for no hotel owner to sleep outside the room door for a night?

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in addition to the plot. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the beginning of the film, you'll think he wants to make a comedy film, and after more than 20 minutes you'll guess it might be an inspiration, and when you see half of it, you'll think it might be a drama that wants to show how hard it is for young people in small towns to survive, and then you'll have no idea what you're looking at, and then you'll have deep doubts about yourself, and why you're going to the cinema for a long time to see shit.

If you want to make a love film, then you'll be honest about the feud between young people in small towns and waitress girls who like to ride motorcycles.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot can't come up with something that is contrary to the normal world.
The new bike that Yoon was playing just got burned and then he could sing, couldn't open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't even watch.
I don't know if that's the reason for acting or the director's request.
I don't know why Han Zhong, as a racer, is so keen on adding crash plot to his own film.
Is such a movie arranged in the spring slot to block the audience?

Such as: drainage, water storage facilities, various types of inspection wells, rainwater mouths, cleavages, septic tanks and small constructions, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules for the construction of inspection wells is that the top and bottom of the module are surrounded by condensed trough structures that combine to form chains.
The well wall wall is far more resistant to cutting than the form of construction of a flat friction structure.
The module is a medium-air structure, a combination of longitudinal holes connected, a horizontal perforation, and a perforated core that forms an existing concrete grid structure that acts as a secondary supplement and waterproof.
The module has slots, lateral hiatus, and longitudinal splics that increase the overall strength of the structure accordingly.
In addition, concrete checks of wells constructed from well modules, drainage wells are not susceptible to phenomena such as collapse, sinking, leaks, mechanical stability of well wall wall modules, simple operations, and size standards.
The concrete check well module brick device smart controls equipped with data input, the output device one key through the touch-style liquid crystal displays the entire process of monitoring the mechanical operation, achieving the desired human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of the comparison, density operation, security logic control and failure diagnosis system.
The well wall wall module mechanical hydraulic system uses single-cylinder hydraulic pressure, transmission, double-cylinder hydraulic pressure, transport.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the reliability of the operation of the hydraulic system due to the impact of the host vibration on the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection of the well module brick equipment trunk went off the grid, the storage door closed, and the automatic delivery tray, all of which were done independently by the hydraulic system, thus reaching a reduction in mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick equipment uses imported computers, appliances, seal hydraulics, and a comprehensive package of quasi-insured equipment that is stable and reliable.
. The well wall wall module mechanical stimulation platform uses a whole sheet steel, with a surface line cutting the model without welding points, allowing the filling box to move freely and fully reduce mechanical wear and tear.

Chongqing Middle School pilot modern apprenticeship, admission to the school is the company's associate employee, Xinhua Network.
Yesterday, journalists were informed by the City Council that, from this year onward, our city will pilot a "modern apprenticeship" talent development model in 60 middle schools, that students who have been trained on the pilot will also have apprenticeship status, and that they will be pre-recorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprises when they are recruited.
The Municipal Council requires that the procedure for admission to secondary schools and employment in enterprises be regulated, that the dual status of students and associate employees of apprentices in secondary schools be clarified, and that tripartite agreements be concluded between apprentices, apprentices, schools and enterprises, in accordance with the principle of two-way choice, and that for apprentices who are 16 years of age or older and who are not 18 years of age, an agreement be concluded between apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the specific positions of interest and apprenticeships in the workplace, the content of their teaching, the protection of rights and interests, etc.
The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt modern forms of apprenticeship and to conduct joint enterprise pre-service and transfer training for business employees.
The pilot school needs to reform the talent development model.
School enterprises jointly design talent development programmes and jointly develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
The pilot was used as a pilot cycle, and the student's internship in the enterprise was determined on the basis of a professional talent development programme, and the top internship was generally six months.
The business practice should implement an enterprise class management model whereby, depending on the characteristics of the different professions, a teacher can bring 2-5 apprentices and form a learning group to ensure that students are skilled in the skills required for each rotational training position.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . from 2016 until August 2019, we identified in three batches 60 municipal mid-level modern apprenticeship pilots, each numbering around 50, bringing together around 3,000 students (apprentices).
In line with the principle of piloting and progressive implementation from point to point, explore the establishment of joint school enrollment, joint development, and long-lasting mechanisms for integrating the breeder, effective upgrading of student job skills and improvement of student peer employment and the quality of employment.

South African Doctor: Omikjan's spread is strong, but it's light.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new coronavirus Omikjan variant is much smaller than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omikjan variant in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 physicians in the South African province of Haudeen reported that the symptoms of new crown patients they are treating are mild, such as physical pain and similar symptoms to flu, such as coughing.
The director of the organization, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he looked at dozens of patients every day, but that no patients were in need of hospitalization.
" They are able to control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation " , said Pillai.
He said that this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who would have been more likely to be seriously affected by coronavirus infection.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Many people are going to be hospitalized in a few days " .
Other doctors shared similar experiences within two weeks of the first report from Southern Africa on the Omikjan mutant strain.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa concluded that only 30 per cent of new crown patients who had been hospitalized in recent weeks were severely ill, half of the severity of the previous wave; the average time spent in hospital was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3 per cent of recent new crown patients had died, compared to 20 per cent of cases of early outbreak in South Africa.
The Director of the African Institute of Health, Willem Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: " Currently, almost all signs indicate that it is a milder disease ... "
He also said, " It's still early, and we need to get later data.
Usually, hospitalisation and death take place late, and we only have two weeks to get into this outbreak. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effects of current vaccines and treatment methods.
While Delta remains the world's leading new coronavirus strain, Omichon cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicentre of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the province increased by 400 per cent during the first week of December, and tests showed that over 90 per cent of the cases of Omikjan variants were reported.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes were sent out!

Educational commentary: What is the basis for saving abducted children?
If there is a well-known public service ad for analogy "no killing without buying or selling", then such crimes will not be repeated without a good environment for "receiving" demand, group control, national anti-trafficking, rendering trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly.
In recent days, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security has launched a platform for the urgent release of information on the disappearance of children, which has been developed by the abduction agency.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the publication of information on missing children and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
I hear this App is called "Reunion" and it's so warm.
The new technology means not only " literature " , full of affections, but also the proper, practical and effective use of information.
The primary objective of kidnapping law enforcement is to retrieve the abducted child and protect his or her physical security and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishments, social prevention to legal education, can be cited in many " great words " .
But before trafficking is solved, priority should be given to the safety of victims.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to the investigative experience of such cases, traffickers are used to stay away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible after they have been able to do so.
One minute more of the abduction, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of detecting the case increases by one point.
In this case, it is indeed pragmatic to come up with an effective way to detect cases and retrieve children, such as the "reunification" platform.
After all, "trafficking" is a big task that needs to be done by operating the entire rule of law system.
The fight against crime, the protection of the rights and interests of children and parents, from the refinement of legislation, to the guarantee of justice, and the thoroughness of law enforcement, do not require the implementation of "care for the weak".
In addition, prevention of child trafficking, from family to society, can be done better.
In a common case, for example, a family of three rest at a train station, parents fall asleep and wake up to discover that the child is missing.
Quite a two-year-old can't be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
It is the minimum means of preventing the abduction of a child that the parents take turns to rest, or place the child under secure protection.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking, the purchase of a abducted child should also be noted and punished.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to our Criminal Code, the legal starting point for the crime of trafficking in children is five years; in particularly serious cases, the death penalty may be imposed and property confiscated.
The crime of trafficking in children is clearly one of the more serious offences under the general trend of "light penalization" with high levels of torture and maximum punishment.
But there are still a lot of trafficking cases each year.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The legal education of this part of the population should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, it is not up to official law enforcement to be strict.
If the kidnapping of the "market" is widespread, the traffickers are motivated, the means of trafficking are constantly being innovative, creating a "fight" situation with law enforcement officials, and the fight against the abduction is bound to fall into an ineffective muddle.
As a result, breaking down backward perceptions and spreading legal commons can also help to combat trafficking and the buying of children.

The summit of democracy is over, and Biden says the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" (December 10), convened by President Biden of the United States and attended by 110 governments from around the world, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, came to a close.
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom was burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes could never put it out.
He also stated that the second global "Democracy Summit " was planned for next year.
The Taiwanese government representative, Councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong's democracy and human rights activist currently in exile in the United Kingdom also spoke at the summit the next day.
And Biden said, " We know how difficult the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
A totalitarian regime will never be able to extinguish the fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people throughout the world and around the world. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He said: " As leaders of government, it is our duty to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the foundations of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resistant to the forces of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest. "
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were, respectively, the defence of human rights, the consolidation of democracy and the right to confront power, and the fight against digital powerism and affirmation of democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening address on the same day, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Gutierrez, also said that the cause of democracy faced challenges globally, particularly emerging digital technologies.
He said, " It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativeism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution ... "
The Hong Kong Democratic Human Rights activist Rhongqing addressed the Summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants of their ongoing concerns about the human rights situation of Chinese ethnic minorities such as Hong Kong and Uighur and Tibetans.
He said, " For a long time, the world has accepted the rise of China without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders have to work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority ... "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He said, " Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy the General Secretary of Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, or some of you don't realize (CPC) threats to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
In a round-table discussion on "Combating digital dictatorship, affirming democratic values", Taiwan ' s Executive Councillor, Tang Feng, released a "State statement" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan was on the front line of the fight against authoritarianism and power.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He said, " At a time when democracy in Taiwan is flourishing, we have always stood firmly on the front line of the global struggle against authoritarianism and have played a leading role in the promotion of global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the outbreak, powerful governments everywhere rationalize human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, with global democracy showing signs of regression.
In Taiwan, however, we don't have to seal the city to control the outbreak, and we don't have to go down to win over false information. "
Just as the second day of the Democratic Summit took place, the United States Department of the Treasury announced that 15 individuals from several countries, including China, North Korea and others, had been convicted of serious human rights violations, and 10 entities had imposed sanctions in accordance with the law, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company that had been found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

The logic and subtext of their existence is — that tennis is so hard, that you can't learn, and you know you can't afford to buy, you can't play cheap, you can't play twice, so this beat is cheap, and you don't feel bad.
When you can really tell what's good and what's bad, it means you're making progress, and then I'll buy the expensive ones again, and I'll make twice.
It's recommended to spend a similar price, buy a better second-hand bat, choose Prince, or Dunloop's, two brands that are not famous enough, so a good shot can't sell the price, and a new shot of 500,600 is fine, with a second-hand 200, with a thousand dollar shot of enjoyable?

Xinhua All-China + Beijing Junior Hockey League Helping Winter Flames - Xinhua Network
On December 11, Beijing dreamed that ING team player Pong Yao Tian (Chinese) would shoot in the game.
The same day, the 2021-2022 Beijing City Junior Hockey Club League went on to compete in Beijing's major ice fields.
The tournament is divided into regular and playoffs, with players aged between U6 and U18, and groups set up into competitive and selection teams, attracting nearly 3600 players from 256 representative teams across the city.

Girls as arrows raise money for their sisters: "It's good to think of a flesh wound." - Xinhua Network.
. . . . . . . . . a girl in Wulin Square, Hangzhou stands in front of a large plank with the words "human target, ten dollars one arrow".
Yesterday morning, a photo of Hangzhou girl Gandam ‘Arrow Targets' raising money for her sister broke the circle of friends.
The photograph shows a girl in Wulin Square, Hangzhou standing in front of a large plank slightly higher than a man, on which the words "human target, ten dollars one arrow" are written, and the indicative roadman can fire with a bow and arrow after paying.
The act sparked a huge discussion among the netizens.
Last night, the head of propaganda at the Lower Town Department of Hangzhou City Public Security confirmed to Xinjing newspaper reporters that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such an excessive move only to raise money for her sister, but that such an action was not worth promoting, and that the girl had left the local police station yesterday after being cautioned.
The girl's street "Arrow Target" fundraiser was cautioned.
. . . . . . . . a long-haired girl stood in front of a large plank, on which the words "human meat target, ten dollars one arrow" were written in black ink, and on another panel before her there were its bank accounts and micro-letters, payment of the treasure account, etc.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There are netizens who believe that this is a "boggling act" and there are a lot of netizens who sympathize with it.
"We found it when we patrolled the square around 10 a.m. on 23 a.m., when there were already a lot of crowds around. "
In an interview with the local media, the Tian Shui police station near the incident said that there were two girls in the stand, both around the age of 20, dressed up to be young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who was a "human target" has been crying and begging for a little bit of the game; the other girl is helping her side, saying that her friend's sister is suffering from leukemia and is in desperate need of surgery, please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou to learn that the girl was raising money for sister leukemia treatment. "
Last night, the head of publicity in the Lower City Division of Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau told the New Kyushu newspaper reporter that the girl was called Ji Jia Li and raised money for her sister Yoshiya Yan.
But because treatment still costs more than 300,000, a good way to raise money is not to be expected to do so.

The head said that " no such kind of eyeball fundraiser is being promoted " .

What's the hottest thing in 2021?
No doubt it's the Tokyo Olympics.
You think only an Olympic kid can win an award?
In the previous period, there was a hot article on "Look! Project Manager can hit gold medals' Olympic projects" in which it was mentioned that project managers were in many projects, and could definitely take the lead, and no one could: moving bricks, travelling on business, spending the night is the project manager's day-to-day, fire-fighting, back-to-back, apology.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And the people working on project management, increasingly, have chosen to get themselves out of their jobs through some actions.
In terms of the number of PMPs (internationally certified project management professional qualifications) registered each year, an increasing number of project management practitioners are learning to upgrade their project management capacity.
According to the Twenty-Year Development Report on Project Management in China (1999-2019): As of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP-referenced candidates nationwide was nearly 600,000, about 420,000 were certified through PMP-rated, and the number of valid witnesses was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2 per cent of the total number of PMP-licensed worldwide.
The increase in the number of PMP holders over the last 10 years indicates that a growing number of project managers are realizing that it is no longer advisable to do things by simply replicating the old experience, and that the rapidly changing work environment makes us know a path to learn, to stand on the shoulders of Scientologist giants and explore the way forward.
However, does the PMP make it possible to keep project management open?
A number of project management beginners have said that, by studying related courses such as PMP/IPMP, the 10 main areas of project management and related knowledge points such as the five major process groups can be systematically mastered, but the actual project management work is still a mist.
Many project managers often provide feedback on the following issues: Project management perceptions are inadequate, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, and do not know how to do it; Lack of systematic project management process systems are supported, work cannot be landed, project estimates are uncertain, controls are poor and projects are delayed; There is no clear division of labour among members, and the "old oil bars" in the team do not know how to cope with poor communication across sectors and the project is difficult to advance...
As a result, more than a dozen projects focusing on product innovation and R & D management have helped many good businesses to develop a large number of key R & D talent, such as product managers, project managers, and have received honorary Chinese Tianxia consultations with courses on the R & D Project Manager's Special Training Camp.
The "Research and Development Project Manager's Special Training Camp" online course is a kind of online fragmentation learning approach that combines the field-based cases, tools and methods of numerous R & D enterprises to help you acquire the required knowledge and standard actions of the project manager on your own path to project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and fewer inputs to facilitate the project manager's development process and to bring efficient operational results to the enterprise.
Incontrovertible, it is possible to see how other participants evaluate the course: this course is not just an in-depth professional presentation of the content of the course by a team of experts from China, China (formerly the R & D management team), in conjunction with the international advanced project management methodology theory and numerous well-known business real-life scenes.

On the eve of the Quayuan Doubles to advocate rational consumption to consumers - Economic Watch - Professional Financial News website
This year's Double Eleven national network paid $1.7 trillion in business transactions, higher than the previous year's innovation.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On the eve of the arrival of the Two-Twelve, Quaker Consumer Finance Company Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the "Tessenger") launched a rational consumption initiative to alert a wide range of users, especially young people, to good consumer awareness and consumption habits and to reject blind consumption and overconsumption.
According to the report of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey published by the People's Bank this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
In general, our residents perform better at the level of financial consumption, but show greater variation in the different aspects of financial behaviour and skills, and there is a need to further upgrade basic financial knowledge.
The relatively low level of financial literacy among older persons and adolescents will remain the focus of sustained attention to financial education; Nielsen's "Report on the Status of Young People's Debt in China" and the "2019-2020 Report on Young People's Consumption" issued by Occidental Economics show that the younger generation has great consumer potential, credit consumption is an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6 per cent of young people are using credit products, nearly half of whom have no accumulated debt, and that while the younger generation as a whole has a rational consumption trend that is very different from the external label of "exhaustible" consumption, some of them do have excessive consumption, follow wind consumption behaviour, and thus have excessive financial pressures and debt risks, and even social problems, and financial enterprises should be bold in their social responsibilities and lead to positive direction.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Tsing has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality, caring services, advocating for consumers to set up good and correct consumption perceptions and responding positively to regulatory calls for practical action to raise consumers' rational consumption awareness, especially among young groups.
Over the past few years, Tsing has been developing a comprehensive and diversified financial literacy campaign for youth groups, including university students, and helping to build the wealth of their lives through a variety of forms of subtly seduction of consumption demand among young groups, such as the launch of the Innovation Practice Contest in partnership with the top institutions in the country.
On the occasion of the arrival of the Double Twelve, the Letter reminded all consumer friends to develop a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, to resist blind and overconsumption, and to circumvent the wrong areas of consumer borrowing so as not to affect personal credence and future economic life.
. . . . . . . consumption must be planned ahead of schedule, and the amount of effort must be repaid on time.
If overdue, late records will be recorded in individual credit reports, which may have an adverse impact on economic life such as buying cars, buying houses, etc. in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should be chosen, and care should be taken to verify whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, good faith will, as it has always done, build on its maturity, reliable consumer financial systems and continuously updated and iterative financial products, bringing more responsive and diversified services to consumers, constantly helping to raise the level of financial knowledge among the general public, helping consumers to foster rational consumption, moderate borrowing, and becoming consumer-reliable consumer financial partners throughout their lives.

People ' s Network of Viet Nam - Gulf Cooperation Council to address common challenges
The stopovers of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first time that Crown Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in 2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while maintaining close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf States signed an agreement between the United States and Kuwait to mediate towards "unity and stability".
. Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors by both countries in Qatar.
The Arab States of the Gulf resolve their differences in order to resume their relations with Qatar out of the demand that they must unite in the interests of all countries and regional stability, with a view to meeting common challenges.
During this visit to Oman by the Saudi Crown Prince, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725-km-long passage connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of the supply chain of the citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth $30 billion have been signed between businesses in both countries.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the Gulf States coincided with the negotiation between Iran and the world ' s major Powers of an agreement to save the Iranian nuclear deal called the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA) – an agreement that the Arab Gulf States condemned because they felt could not resolve the issue of Iranian missiles.
The Gulf States have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competition" and Iran ' s nuclear programme as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf States believe that the failure to resolve the Iranian missile issue and to act to curb Iran's activities in the area is flawed.
In the context of the failure of the major Powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf States in their nuclear negotiations with Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iran have engaged in direct negotiations.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC States since the end of the dispute between some member States and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic results of its contribution to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua Network

Since the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has carried out a unique mission distinct from that of other social organizations, and for our university, the spirit of which arose in the fall of national distress, was much influenced by changes in traditional culture and times, advocating the concept of the value of "Mindzis, Shujihei" and patriotism as "the rising powers".
Currently, the informationization of higher education, the increasing trend towards internationalization, the global competition for education, science and technology, the increasing competition for talent, and higher education as an important " supply side " are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges for structural change.
In particular, the introduction of the General Programme for the Integrated Advancement of the World's First Class Universities and the Construction of First Class Sciences, while demonstrating our confidence and determination to move from the great powers of higher education to the powerful states of higher education, demands a higher level of renewal for university development.
How can efforts be made in a relatively short period of time to become part of the world ' s popular ranks, to accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines on the basis of a gap that still exists, and to achieve a " bend overcar " ?
In addition to a firm goal of confidence, path confidence, and ability, higher education institutions should fully exploit three advantages: first, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and quality by continuously bringing in outstanding academic talent from overseas, learning to learn from the world's leading universities; secondly, to build on the intellectual connotations of Chinese civilization in its five thousand years and to promote the development of a good traditional culture as a means of cohesiveness, branding and image-raising; and thirdly, to build on the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthen goal-drivenness, bring together consensus forces, optimize resource allocation and provide sustainable and solid guarantees for schools to accelerate their catch-up to the world's advanced levels.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the case of the University of Zhejiang, we have focused on three features in our schools: first, highlighting the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurial talent development, building the integration of science and education, integrating the culture of school enterprises into an integrated human environment that forms a chain-wide ecosystem of entrepreneurship education; secondly, highlighting the cross-cutting features of the discipline, promoting the optimization of the discipline system, creating an institutional environment for cross-disciplinary cross-fertilization and actively fostering cross-cutting emerging disciplines and iconic cross-cutting outcomes; and thirdly, highlighting the characteristics of the academic system and social services, developing in-depth international communication cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a pan-Zhegian system of cooperation for research and development.
In this process, it is particularly important to maintain the spirit of the university at all times, so that the spirit of the university resonates with the spirit of the times.
For the University of Zhejiang, the "Innovation" school's training, "Individence, Shinde, Distinguished, and Faithful" shared values and "Heine River, Kaijin-hye-hye-de, Foreman, Tree-Our Nation" together constitute the latest system of expression of Zhe's great spirit.
This is an important guarantee, rich in content and far-reaching, for schools to maintain the correct course of schooling, to build up cultural heights and to gather spiritual strength.
Among them, the "Heine River" emphasizes openness and inclusion, reflecting the spirit of "the world's best talent for me", as well as the idea of learning from the world's best name; "The Enlightenment" emphasizes the spirit of truth and goodness, which means that universities, while pursuing truth, are more subject to the metallurgy and personality of virtue; "The people who are the first to open things", which embodies a spirit of reform and innovation that embraces knowledge, scientific innovation, and reform and development; "The Trees of Our Nation" emphasizes the spirit of patriotic devotion, saying that universities should always be disgraced with the destiny of their nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value-seeking is where the soul of the University of Zhejiang has been studying for 120 years.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Chinese university of higher education is further building on the whole Chinese-specific socialist cause, deeply grasping the era and historical mission of higher education, and accelerating its construction into a world-class university.
At the same time, upholding the humanistic and independent freedom, allowing the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times, and the spirit of the nation to interact with each other, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus for the attainment of the country's prosperity and national revitalization and the realization of the common ideals of humanity.

Thanks to all the people who took the wedding picture today, they're looking forward to making a film.
Taking pictures of the wedding is a physical job, especially for photographers, running and jumping.
The make-up guy was kind enough to help me design a makeup face suitable for my face, and the photography brother was funny and well-received when he shot it.
Thanks to my photographers and make-up, I can still see myself so beautiful in life.

The wedding picture is so beautiful, blowing up photographers and makeup artists, you're really super specialty.
Thank you very much for your patience and careful instruction. I love the pictures I took.
The moment I saw the wedding picture, I didn't recognize myself.

It's more important to take a wedding picture than to have both the photographer and the make-up artist aesthetic online, and I'm glad I met.
When I saw my wedding picture, I found out that I was a "false" too.
The American-Asian group complained about discrimination in admission to 3 Ivy League schools such as Yale - Xinhua Network
Xinhua Washington, D.C., May 23 (journalist Xu Kenmei) USA "Over 30 Asian groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice on May 23 against three Ivy Fame schools – Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College – that discriminated against Asian students in the admission process.
The Asian Education Coalition, which led the appeals, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group's chairman, Zhao Woo-young, said at the launch that "the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to U.S.-named schools has multiplied over the past 0 years, but in these three U.S.-name schools, the share of Asians has remained essentially at the same level.

. . . . A study by scholars such as Saunders in 20 "4 shows that, in these three higher schools, Asians have the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
The U.S. Department of Education data also show that in all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest intake rates for Asian students, and Yale and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.

They also expect to be sued for higher education to take the initiative to focus on this issue and change the admission policy for Asians.
At present, the three colleges and universities that have been complained of have not responded.
The Asian Education Union was founded in 20" 5 years, when it complained about discrimination in admission to Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education was not admitted on procedural grounds.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the house broker that a factory was located in Yao Boteng Township in Zhejiang, and after several live visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Luo made a deposit on the same day by bank transfer of $200,000 after consulting with the family of the owner of the house about the details of the purchase of the plant.

After that, however, the parties failed to agree on the main contractual terms, such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the manner of payment, resulting in delays in the conclusion of the contract for the purchase and sale of the house.
In view of the failure of the parties to reach consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the $200,000 down payment to Mr. Luk.
It's hard to see the house, the deposit is paid, the rent is ready, and the seller is not selling the contract, which leaves Mr. Luk helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Luk sued Lin to Yu Yao City People's Court.
The court, after hearing, held that the failure of the parties to conclude a formal contract could not be attributed to the defendant alone and should be reasonably presumed to be non-consultative, so that in the present case the penalty should not apply, and the defendant would not have to bear the responsibility for breach of the double return of the deposit.
After the first-instance judgement, the plaintiff appealed.
In recent days, the court of second instance upheld the original sentence.
[Advocate reminds] Do the necessary due diligence in the course of the transaction.
• When entering into a contract, be the buyer with the necessary due diligence obligation, for example, to verify information about the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and to specify in the contract the exact time, place, of delivery, in order to prevent disputes between the parties in the performance of the contract.
On Friday, the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Office issued a statement saying that the " Leaders ' Democratic Summit " , organized by the United States, was " an ideologically framed, instrumentalized, weaponized, pseudo-democratic anti-democratic reality, incitement to separatist confrontation and the transfer of domestic contradictions " .
According to the Chinese Government, " for a long time, the United States imposed its own political system and values, pursued 'democratic transformation ' , imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolution ' , with disastrous consequences.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The summit was a move by Biden to live up to its campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video, and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to participate, including Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States with problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also challenges at the international level and within the United States, such as criticism of some leaders who are invited to participate in the summit, including leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some doubt that the real intentions of the Biden administration are not to organize the summit for the sake of democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly assumed German Chancellor Scholtz also participated in the video democracy summit.
The statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday states that " today ' s American-style democracy is becoming more and more morbid, with monetary politics, identity politics, political rivalry, political polarization, social torn apart, racial contradictions, and the division of rich and poor " , and that democracy in the United States is a capital-based " rich game " .
In his statement, U.S. President Biden stated, " It is our responsibility, as leaders of the government, to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the foundations of democracy, to promote reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resistant to the forces of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not a matter of course, " we must constantly update it among every generation, which, in my view, is the decisive challenge of our time " .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The United States, for its part, is committed to a year-long operation following this Democratic Summit, which will include an initiative worth $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the entity democracy summit planned for the end of 2022.
" Let us all implement our commitments and report next year on the progress we have made " , Biden said.
All right, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.

These sweet drinks, in addition to being medium and sour, can visually bring pleasure to people, add drinks, and act as a dilution to change tastes.
The red whisky + slice of lemon + square sugar (sand sugar can also) is the most authentic, traditional drink.
The authentic red Fang taste is somewhat sour, adding sugar can neutralize it, while lemons bring fresh flavors to the wine, and, of course, sweet acidity can be arranged according to personal taste preferences.
The three above are the best drinks of red-card whiskey, and you can try it as a reference, hoping that the introduction of the minor will help you.
Educational thinking: how college examinations make "heavy" and "scumster" a part of Xinhua's network.
. . . . . . . . . . three students at Lanzhou Transportation University wrote to the head of the school, reflecting confusion about the university examination and proposing to improve the difficulty of the examination, to change the question of the examination so that the examination truly reflects the student's actual level of demand.
It is true that, for a long time, university examinations have been a "hot topic."
On the university campus, students come from the four seas of the Five Lakes, with varying levels of competence, combined with varying degrees of learning, and learning varies widely.
. There are different feelings about the examination of groups with such diverse characteristics, which are inevitable.
of course, if the test question is single, the repetition rate is high and the subject is too simple, it will inevitably create another distinct feeling.
A student with no merit, who may be able to achieve a pre-test concentration raid, and if he thinks of any other way, he may achieve a more than half-work.
In this way, "scumsters" can pass without input, or even with high marks; "heavy" never drops, homework, notes are good, and examinations are not much higher than the "grotesque status quo".
In this way, the students of Lanzhou who were raised did not have no reason to reflect the problems in the university examinations, and it is believed that this situation is not exclusive to Lanzhou.
In this sense, the three students who write straight are to be praised.
In fact, it is not uncommon for people who have attended college to know that surprise exams, to think of various ways to "set" the questions from their teachers, try to draw the scope of the examinations and get "focus counseling" before they get a test, and even if they have a small copy in the exam, it is not surprising that they are asking for a teacher to raise your hand.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . as a quality assessment guide to teaching quality, as measured by the teacher's overall grasp of teaching and learning . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There is no doubt that the basic point of knowledge of a discipline is the subject of a university examination.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As the teacher said, " 20 years ago, the basic knowledge of mathematics at the university was still in school, or is it the focus " .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In many universities, examinations typically form question groups, which are combined by senior teachers of the subject, and examination papers are also attended by all the teachers responsible for the section, so that the duplication of questions can be overcome to some extent.
But to develop a set of practical subjects that are consistent with teaching and learning, topics that are difficult to distribute properly depending on the student's overall learning situation, there is also a need for an integrated knowledge of teaching and a comprehensive analysis of the extent to which students learn, so that the examination propositions are easy and subject-types are dynamic and capable of highlighting both basic and competency-based examination and innovative design of the subject.
The examination is the command stick of university education, and what kind of examination, and the student will have the corresponding preparatory program, which in the long run will affect the effectiveness of university education.
In response to student advice letters, Lanzhou gave high priority to the school, and an overhaul programme was deployed throughout the school.
The teaching units are required to organize self-checks of teachers for research and course-ending examinations, to develop test-team propositions and related systems, while at the same time strengthening supervision and inspection of examination-team propositions and clearances, fine-tuning performance appraisals, and strengthening the comprehensive examination of the various components of course teaching.
The institutional solution to the single type of questions, repetition of topics, etc., is a subject that university examinations need to face, of course, and the corresponding system needs to be put in place, but kung fu is expensive on a daily basis, requiring teachers to have a full grasp of the teaching situation, not only through the teaching content, but also through student learning, with a better interface between the two heads, teaching and learning, creating a virtuous interaction, and the examination will also be more realistic, so that the "heavy" and "scumster" will have their share.

Mrs. Kim's wedding photo (South Street store) There's no branch yet.
We changed our time twice before taking the picture, and the counselor, Ranland, was patient in scheduling the time for us.
It was later chosen for a good weather weekend.
Ms. Kim's staff, be they consultants, cosmetics or photographers, are great.
It was the first time in my life that I was officially made up. Wow. I can't believe I'm gonna be that good-looking one day, huh.
Xiao Jing and another girl (I'm sorry I can't remember the name) make-up is super patient and it's natural.
The outside scene was taken in Jiang Wan City, fortunately because it was a good day, not feeling cold, taking pictures, and the make-up man looked at our clothes from time to time, and the headpiece, a little bit bad, helped us sort it out right away.
The photographers were also very humorous and were happy to take pictures all day long.
When you pick a picture, because you see a lot of cases online, you don't want the guests to delete too much, but when we pick a picture, really, it doesn't mean we're going to have to add a picture at all, and there's 24 of them in the direct set, none of them.
The photo was fixed today and Ranland sent it to me, and I looked at two that didn't feel good, and they immediately helped me rework it.
I'm really happy with the pictures that my sister used to take. They're so new, they're the style I want.
It's really recommended that Mrs. Han-Kin take a wedding photo!
Set price: $3999
Thank you, Mrs. Kim, for your sincere wishes of happiness and happiness.

"Miss... I'm a director, and I see you're beautiful and interested in a reality show?"
You're confused. You're afraid it's a hoax.
He plugged you a business card, and you found out that he was really the director of a large Japanese entertainment company.
"Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company and we'll have less money. "
You came to the company with him, and he said he saw you on the street at a glance, and I'd love you to come.

People's Daily Review : "XIV5" achieves a good start – learning to follow the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference – Xinhua Network
Xinhua Beijing 11 December People's Daily 12 December commentator's article: "XIV5" achieves a good start – on learning to follow the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference
The ‘1450' good start was achieved, and the Central Economic Work Conference, held from 8 to 10 December, highly evaluated the achievements of the country ' s economic and social development over the past year.
The General Secretary of Xi gave an important speech at the conference, providing a deep overview of the economic work of 2021, an in-depth analysis of the current economic situation, a major deployment of the economic work of 2022, and giving us a clear way forward for next year's economic work, in anticipation of the party's twenty major victories, and providing a fundamental follow-up.
We celebrate the centenary of the establishment of the Communist Party of China, officially proclaiming the complete construction of Xiao Kang society, achieving the first centenary of the struggle, opening the way for the full construction of a modern socialist state, and embarking on a new march towards the second centenary of the struggle.
We convened the party ' s nineteenth mid-sixth plenary session to take stock of the party ' s major achievements and historical experience in its centenary struggle and to adopt the third historical resolution in the history of the centenary party, the " CCP resolution on the party ' s centenary achievements and historical experience " , a political declaration of the Chinese Communist Party of the new era, bearing in mind its first mission, to uphold and develop China ' s distinctive socialism, which is a historical guide to action to usher in the future and achieve the great renaissance of the Chinese nation.
Over the past year, the cross-cutting effects of the global pandemic of the 100-year-old and new coronae pneumonia outbreaks have become more complex and challenging in the external environment, and the tasks of prevention and control of the new coronae pneumonia outbreak and economic and social development in the country have been extremely demanding.

These achievements were achieved as a result of the strong leadership of the party centered on Comrade Xi and the scientific guidance of Xi's new era of China's distinctive socialist ideas, as a result of the concerted and hard-won struggles of all ethnic groups throughout the party.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
With General Secretary Xi Jinping at the heart of the party's centre, the core of the party taking the helm, the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping's new era of China's distinctive socialist ideas, and the unity and tenacious struggle of all the nation's peoples, we must be able to overcome the difficulties and obstacles of creating a new era of glory on the new march to fully build a modern socialist country, and to forge a new historical legacy.
Next year, the party will be at its top twenty, a major event in the political life of the party and the country.
The promotion of the great founding party spirit, the maintenance of a stable and well-paced approach to progress, the integrity, accuracy and full implementation of the new development concept, the acceleration of the construction of a new development landscape, the overall deepening of reform and openness, the persistence of innovation to drive development, the promotion of high-quality development, the adherence to supply-side structural reforms, the integration of outbreak control and economic and social development, the integration of development and security, and the continuation of the "six-six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six, the sustained improvement of the livelihood of the population, the stabilization of the macro-economic momentum, the maintenance of the economic performance between reasonable zones, and the stability of the social system will ensure a stable and healthy economic environment, the social environment of the country, the social environment of the Thai people'san, and the positive political environment, and the positive political environment, and the twenty-s-s-s-s-s-s twenty-forth victory of the party.
Let us unite more closely around the center of the party, with Comrade Xi as its core, to increase "four consciousness " , to firmly " four confidence " , to achieve "two defence " , to constantly improve political judgement, political awareness, political implementation, to put party central decision-making in place with practical action, and to keep the new era of China ' s distinctive socialist cause moving forward.
I'll re-list with points. Thank you.

Education information: Beijing compression of the rate of school attendance at the beginning of 2016 - Xinhua Network
On 21st, 22nd, and 2nd, the Beijing City Junior High School entrance examination was conducted by a unified organization of district teaching boards.
This year, the regions of Beijing have reduced the proportion of students enrolled in specialty schools, and the competition for specialty schools has become more intense.
In the Eastern Region, for example, this year the proportion of students enrolled in primary and middle school did not exceed 5 per cent of the total number of district-wide enrolments, with 380 students enrolled, and 10 per cent of the total number of students enrolled in schools.
All students with sports, art, technology and special skills who register online are eligible for specialty student admissions.
In order to facilitate the attendance of students close to the examination, the East Side continued last year's examination arrangements by setting up 1 to 2 check-ups in each school district, for a total of 13 check-ups.
The examination points are divided by the examination area and the hours are divided into hours, and on the day of the examination the students will enter the examination in time for examination within the different examination areas.
On May 23, the online list of students who passed the examination at the District Educational Admission Examination Centre was made public, and students were able to consult the results online.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, with "buffer zone"
In Beijing, Xinhua, on 11 December (journalist Tung Ruefeng, Gu Zhongqing) the State Council's Joint Control Mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the control of the new coronae pneumonia outbreak in the port city, requiring people who had recently left the land border port city (except those connected to Hong Kong, Macau) to hold a 48-hour nucleic acid detection negative certificate to perform at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival at the land border port city.
According to the circular, the time frame for the above-mentioned request is from the date of the determination of the port city range in the municipalities of the provinces and the announcement of 15 March 2022.
In addition, the notification suggested that conditional port cities could study the establishment of an outbreak-control buffer zone within the jurisdiction.
The head of the National Board of Health and Health's Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control presented that for some port cities cross-border border trade was the main economic pillar in the area, with people on both sides moving frequently.
The introduction of a zoning differential management policy, with a change from a defensive spill line to a two-way line, is expected to achieve a pre-shipment of the level and to compress the risk of an outbreak spill in order to achieve maximum impact in terms of minimal social impact and minimal social cost in terms of disease prevention.
In recent times, there have been a number of home-grown concentrated outbreaks in the country, all of which are imported through the ports and cities.
As noted in the above-mentioned circular, this exposes a number of local outbreak surveillance warnings that are not timely, closed ring management of personnel in high-risk positions is not in place, regular nucleic acid detection flows in form, cold chain items are not eliminated, there are irregularities in centralized site management, and there is insufficient scientific precision in emergency response to outbreaks.
The circular called for an effort to improve the system for preventing and controlling urban outbreaks at ports, to improve the early warning system for disease surveillance, and to implement border control measures in nine areas, to accelerate the filling of short-board weaknesses in urban control at ports, without relaxation, scientific precision in the prevention and control, and to weave out-of-the-counter defence into the lines.
The circular stressed the need for ports and cities to synchronize their research on disease prevention and control with human security efforts, synchronize deployment, publish and provide access to the Human Security Hotline, periodically screen for emerging problems such as the supply of basic goods, prices, and address and respond proactively to salient issues as reflected by the public.
According to the circular, the port cities referred to therein include open land, waterways, the county (city, district, flag), the municipality (local, state, union) and the municipality directly under its jurisdiction, the specific scope of which is determined and promptly announced by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under its jurisdiction) on the basis of the need to prevent and control the outbreak.
Colours: As colours cannot be avoided, the closest color of the object will indicate that the exterior light will cause the color of the clothing to shine and prior consultation before the problem of color is purchased.
This is an ancient one, and the first purchaser of the ancient is for a hundred degrees of "vintage" or "old" words.

The pipeline video updates the 20-year bloodthirsty killing truths of the U.S. Army - Xinhua Network.
(Video source: pipeline)
On December 11, a micro-documentary on the pipeline platform, called the Killing Machine, attracted widespread attention.
The film tells of the war in Afghanistan waged by the United States under the name of "anti-terrorism", the forced export of American democracy through war, the 20-year-old warlord martial arts, the bloodthirsty, the indiscriminate killing of innocent people and the commission of various crimes against humanity.
The indiscriminate use of drones to bomb civilian sites such as hospitals, schools, distort humanity, and set up homicide teams.
. . . . . . . over 20 years, American troops have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up a "black prison" to inflict all kinds of torture and physical humiliation on "suspects".
A crime against humanity has aroused hatred among more Afghans.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The war did not bring the Afghan people hope for peace and democracy, prosperity, but only a devastated country and countless destructions of killing.
Poke video, let's come together to reveal the truth about the blood-thirsty killing of the United States in the name of "counter-terrorism" and the hypocritical face of American democracy!
Unwittingly, see the following article on why this customer needs to be canned by a logistics company in the tax zone, from both a commercial and a conservation point, although the cannery is deep-processed and does not fall within the scope of the insurance logistics company, this text may explain why the customer wants to do so.
I went to a lot of milk powder plants and came into contact with a lot of milk powder production lines.
The bags are actually identical to the raw materials of the milk powder they're listening to, and there's no difference.
So you're sure to ask, "Why is the bag-loading warranty period of one year and the hearing warranty period of two years or more?"
Or ask: Why is the price of hearing and bagging so far?
It's actually a lot of consumers from this point on, or Mom thinks it's because raw materials aren't the same, so it's a lot better quality.
It's like raw materials. It's just that what everyone thinks is expensive is good.
There are consumers who react after eating out of this mentality and say it's not the same way to listen or taste!
Now, let me tell you why you're so expensive. Where are you?
Why are the differences in their raw materials so large?
Because most of the plant's pricing takes into account the fact that it is difficult for consumers to accept a bag price too high, which means that the profits generated by the plant are very low, or there is no profit, and how does the plant survive?
So they've got a big uphill margin on the listening pricing to secure their profit space.
So most of the plant owners pushed for a listening suit, not a bag.
And how do you think that the company's advertising costs tens of millions or even hundreds of millions a year?
Everyone knows what it is.
So, as society develops, the cost of marketing the market, for example: promotion workers at the mall, display costs at the mall, gift costs for products, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
So the manufacturers are constantly adding new items and listening, and their prices are constantly rising, which is in fact new as market costs increase.
The main objective is to obtain higher profits, and actually their raw materials will not cost more than $34.
There are also a number of brands that, in order to promote their products, do whatever they can, connect with the hospital's doctors, who assist in the promotion of the products, and draw profits ranging from $30 to $80 from one hearing.
The Chinese law in question does not allow such methods of operation, which in fact harm consumers in the pit.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder into a jar if you have a can at home, so that you can save costs, and increase the conservation and sealability of milk powder has no effect on children.

It's like saying that a moment goes past the "how to do" which is actually the most important, fundamental part of the chain.
That's why these books all have a common feature – either dry to the best, or simply don't do anything; or 100, or zero; or you go to Tarzan, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" will be recognized by anyone, but 99% of them will be scared to death in front of the starter line.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For those who keep the rules, follow the old and refuse to change, you prefer to shout in his ear, "You're going to change," without a doubt, to deceive yourself and play the piano against the cattle.
The vast majority of the people would be shy in the face of the word "change" and would be unable to make a decision; or, with a moment of impulse, they would have abetted the "change" resolve and courageously took the first step, but often the good scenes were not long and could not hold on for a few more moments before losing the battle, which was difficult to sustain.
The famous "start tomorrow" of Mr. Marcili's vocals is the classic in which this "universal humanity" is manifested most divinity.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often transcends the limits of the capacity of ordinary people, leaving the vast majority of people "starved."
Maybe, "the principle of second best" is a way of putting more ordinary people on a relatively successful path.
The core of the "second good principle" lies in "throwing down the threshold" – it encourages a "small win" theory, that is, if it cannot be 100, just one: because one is greater than zero ever; and if it doesn't reach Tarzan, just the little dunes on your door, because it's always better than where it stood.
Anyway, as long as you do something, it's better than not.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
All in all, the "best principle", though ostensibly under the banner of success for all, ultimately inspires, in fact, a few; and the " second best principle" effectively motivates more and benefits as many as possible.
Do I need to reorder now?
There's no answer.
It's been a long time.
Not yet.
Excuse me, when will it be delivered?
How do I get in touch?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer. Thank you.
He missed two meals, but there's one, order, that's over.
I'd like to ask how to get in touch with the rider.

Qinghai Lake's bare-grain resource reserves increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Network
On 11 December, Xinhua's news reporter Xinling (journalist Kam Xiao Fei, Zhang Hongxiang) learned from the Agricultural Rural Hall of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the bare-wall resource reserves of Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year from the previous year, to 1,085 million tons, an accumulated increase of more than 40 times over the initial period of protection in 2002.
The Qinghai lake's nudity carp is commonly known as the Qinghai, a precious species endemic to Qinghai Lake, and plays a vital role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the Qinghai Lake basin's "water-fish-bird" ecological chain.
In the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by factors such as the massive man-made capture and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters of bare-grained water, the number of bare-grained rocks in the Qinghai Lake fell sharply, with only 2592 tons of bare-grain resources in 2002.
Qinghai Lake Naked Wall was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species in 2004.
Since 2003, the province of Qinghai has implemented a sealing of lake fish, prohibiting all units, groups and individuals from fishing for bare carp to the main rivers and tributaries of the Qinghai Lake and Lake Area, and prohibiting the sale of bare carp and its products.
At the same time, the collection of bare-grain resources in Qinghai Lake has increased year by year, through measures such as artificially increased discharge and clean-up of Qinghai Lake's main riverways, and the design of scientifically sound "overfish channels".
Qinghai's deputy director of the Rural Department of Agriculture, Yanglin, has described the cumulative implementation of artificial enrichment and release of nearly 180 million tails of the Qinghai Lake nudity to date, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of the Qinghai Lake nudity resources.
The Qinghai Three River Source area is an important ecological barrier and water-cultivation area for our country and Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and eco-functional area to control the spread of desertification to the east in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three River Source Areas and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife and preserve the biodiversity of the Qinghui Plateau, since this year, the Qinghai has issued a catch ban on the priority waters of Yangjiang, Huang River, and Qinghai Lake, which has created a comprehensive catch ban management system.

I'll only get one bag from the restaurant. It'll be in the bag. It's cold.
You want to ask, is the takeaway in a bag?
We only saw a bag.
Want to know if it's missing, or if we've got some of it, thanks.
It's been an hour. It hasn't been delivered yet.
It's too long to see an article about a holiday.
Give the unknown male Cope a second.
The majority of girls will suddenly go through the first official holiday one day during their 13-15 years of age and stay closed around the age of 50.
After that, the conditions of physical health will be more regular, once a month.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The length of time, the amount of blood, the degree of pain varies from one person to another, from three days to one week; from a small flow of people to a large avalanche; from a small response of some people, to an ambulance, to an ambulance, and from a pain that will change over time, before it doesn't mean a lifetime of pain.
The menstruation cannot be controlled and bleeds 24 hours in the days to the end, and all that can be done is to prevent the flow of blood to the clothes chair with a sanitary towel or a tampon.
The pains are mainly due to the secretion of prostates, and it's no use eating buffen when the physiology period starts before it's too late.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If it's about the cycle, it doesn't make sense to have a tummy, it'll be menstruation in two days.
The sanitary towel is better replaced once in two or three hours, otherwise it is easier to breed bacteria, remove sleep time, and in the worst case, change six times a day, 7 days a month, that is, 42 pieces, if plus the pre-prepared copies may be 50 pieces, not one per month.
Here's a change. The tampons don't have to be changed often. Maybe five or six hours at a time, up to eight hours at the most.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But official crime rate data show that women's ability to control emotions is still high and will not be used as an excuse for emotional problems.
It's not just blood. It contains a defunct uterine membrane.
The membrane at the end of the menstruation is the thinst, then slowly thickened, and it can be understood that the uterus is the house, that the house is built every month (the inner membrane thickens) ready to meet the guests, who do not come, and that it is all removed (the menstruation excavated) to build a new house next month and again.
Menstrual conditions are inconvenient, bleeding 24 hours a month for decades, abdominal pains for a few days each month. Who would like that?
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Many of the women's past things were crushed, and society brainwashed women to say it was dirty, shameful, and everyone thought it was the way it was, but times changed.
If one feels that menstrual menstrualness and that a woman's body is a disgusting preparation for the birth of life should not be said in large public, girls stand up and don't think, never experience it, never experience it, never know it much, not know it, not be so ungrateful, how can it be so nice to face their mother and want their children?
Finally, the sisters try the tampons. It's really good.
It's winter to holiday. It's a disappointment to be wrong.
I'll order another meal for the kids.
I hope the shop is busy checking out the products.
Did you lose the power?
The choice of the right bath can serve a good function of pediatric health care, and today the national editor-in-chief will answer this question, hoping to help his friends.
As people become more aware of health care, the baths are becoming more and more popular with consumers, and a large number of different sets of products emerge on the market, ranging from a hundred different to thousands of dollars in the baths, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the relevant data surface, there is a certain safety hazard as a result of the bursting of home power sales in the health care category, such as the foot bath, compared to traditional home electricity, but the foot bath does not have a specialized industry standard.
"It's too dangerous to bubble your feet in the water with electricity!"
Mr. Lee told reporters that he had bought a bath for his father's birthday in recent days, but that his father felt numb in his feet.
Mr. Lee initially thought it was due to the vibration function of the bath, and didn't expect to turn off the vibration function, and the father still felt his feet numb.
Mr. Lee tried with an electric pen, which was actually lit, and Mr. Lee was surprised to find electricity in the water in the bath.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

So select a split-style puddle at the time of the purchase.
The water and electricity are separated, and there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take any electrocution you want.
13th provincial tea fair opening - node headlines - Hunan Daily News Network - Hua-song Online
The Hunan Daily News, 10 December (all-media journalist Zhang Wu Hu looks forward to communicator Liu Xiaoling Photograph Li Jian) this morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Fair and the Newized Red Tea Advertiser will be held at the Hunan International Convention Exhibition Centre to showcase the tea industry, innovative tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprinting of the 100 billion tea industry goals.
The Deputy Director of the Board of Directors of the National Council for Supply and Marketing Cooperation of China was successful, and the Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hongji, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhanghua, a member of the Chinese engineering faculty, made a grand presentation at the opening ceremony: the source of the lake's red is new, and the rise of the red tea has given new impetus to the "Four Color Teas".
In recent years, the provincial council, the provincial government, has strongly supported the development of the tea industry, advancing the construction of the hundreds of billion tea industry, creating a pattern of development of the "Sixuan Four Waters Five Teas".
The provincial tea industry has increased innovation, green tea, black tea, red tea, etc., and the main tea sector has advanced the integration of tea brigades, driving a wide range of tea farmers to harvest.
The wind shui rotates and the red tea works again.
The provincial tea industry experts said that the green tea was taken for red tea, the black tea, the tea farmers had an income of four seasons a year, and the value of tea garden production rose straight up.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leadership awarded the fourth batch of companies to use the "Huanan Red Tea" trademark, a new version of the glamour "The Source of Lake Red".
In the new red tea stand, Fujian tea merchants look at a high mountain tea called Ice Spring, and immediately place an order.
The Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, Wang, is pleased to say that the current outbreak, among other factors, has more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea fair, the bright spots appear.
The new red tea is red and injected into the culture of tea, the human atmosphere, the trading fire, and the tea industry to welcome the new spring.
So if the food isn't hot, can it be cancelled?
I don't want it. He couldn't get it up because he couldn't stop down there.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I would like here to express my sincere gratitude to your friends for the humanitarian assistance that they have given for more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I made a personal appeal to friends in the country and abroad in early 1994.
The old parents of the vast majority of the victims today have been thanked and the orphans have grown up to work as families.
It's your honor to help us with the most difficult times for our families.
The new coronae outbreak is currently spreading around the world, and most donors have retired annually.
Therefore, I implore you to suspend the humanitarian contribution to our plight — the Tiananmen Mothers Group — a humanitarian operation that should have had a perfect ending long ago.
I will always remember your love, and I firmly believe that your will will be remembered for history.
For a variety of reasons, I can only express my will in this way and ask my friends to understand!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Zhuang Tao: Allow me to take this opportunity to present a brief account of the 32 years of humanitarian assistance carried out by the All-American Self-Academy Federation (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the course of humanitarian assistance, the All-America Federation for Self-America and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, with project implementers often intersecting.
(Apple Daily Chart: Tiananmen's mother's website is run by the pottery.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
The bailouts often fail to reach the six or four.
In 1994, upon the recommendation of Mr. Ting, a special team was set up by Mother Tiananmen to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian assistance.
In 1998, the MDDF established the Six-Four Orphan Education Fund, 11 years after its implementation, and in 2009, following the graduation of all six-and-four orphans from university, the MDDF then established the Six-Four Orphaned Older Persons' Special Hardship Fund, which has been implemented to date.
The funds for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations in the year of six or four years, from individual generosity, and were supported by the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Correctional Research Foundation.
Until last year, 31 years later, the Six-Four had finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of Six-Four.
In the meantime, "Human Rights in China" is also carrying out their humanitarian projects independently.
We understand that Mr. Ding's call for the suspension of the 64th contribution is a consideration for donors, and that we are indeed some retired elderly people whose income is not as good as before retirement, and we would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding's "To Friends" letter.
We will respect the decision of the difficult ones to terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as necessary.

Not to mention Mr. Ta Liang, photography is quite a profession.
The whole studio is very artistic, and there are two kittens to play with.
We're working in Beijing, and a better movie building in Beijing needs to be lined up six months early.

Come out as a piece of us and everybody around us.
The best friend has been recommended for the past, and the best friend has just seen the negative.
I hope this kind of studio is not buried, and more people find the ta, and film it in their own style, not in a thousand.
Thank you very much for taking the eagle, for the five-star review, both very thoughtful and creative newcomers. We're creative studios.
Sweet assistant, and lively photographer teacher, everyone on the team is super-nice, and it's hard to forget, and it works a lot better than I thought, and thank you very much.
Thanks to O-woo's point of view, it's also a fate to know you.
How do I pay?

If you want to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have an idea about it, it's better to learn on your own, after all, because the training costs a lot, and it takes six months to learn.
But training is indeed a very good option if it is intended to enter this industry, especially for those who are self-regulating and their weak, and training is even more a very good choice.
If you have more self-control, you can also choose self-study, but you'll be tired.
Of course it's very important to choose a good training institution.
It depends first and foremost on the strength of the institution's staff, which is of little use if the strength of the staff is not strong enough, and of course the strength of some of the newly opened training institutions is not particularly strong.
The second is to look into this training institution before choosing, and it is better to look into the students who come out of this institution, after all, that only the students of the institution know what the institution really is, and that the course of speech is good or bad.
I don't know how to answer that question, because you don't have some information about your own situation, and there's a big connection between learning this thing and your personal situation.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If you're a student and have not graduated, or have graduated from the computer profession, then if there's enough time for me personally to recommend self-study, this is the least efficient and cost-effective, and many of the training institutions on the offline are now really good, but one study is expensive, two devotes more time, and the basic need is to focus on training for 3-6 months.
But if that's what I'm saying, self-learning is easy, and now many of the learning resources on the network are free, or there are plenty of training resources to go to station b, and if you won't find the resources, you can also contact me through the profile, get free resources, or give detailed advice.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with integrated video learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can also pay for a certain amount of learning money and time costs, it is recommended that you go to a training institution to study, so that it is not too hard to learn, that the teacher speaks in detail, that questions are answered specifically, and that there is help in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have in-house places, and then study to recommend going to the company, so that the interview sessions that follow in search of a job can also save a lot of money.
The above is some of my observations, and the foregoing, because of a lack of knowledge of your situation, is not detailed in the general description, and if you have any other advice, you can contact me at any time to communicate with me.
I said, before 1:00, I saw it all at App.

And that's how life is, and people just look at the results, and they're alone in the process, and in the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong, and we have no choice but to go on, and the road can look back, but we can't go back...

It's hard to do in all walks of life!
But I always believed that if I was serious, insistent, hard-working, I'd be a little better than anyone else, at least better than sitting and complaining."
One day is morning, and all the beauty begins in the morning, and I hope you carry joy, luck, health, as you wish, and start a new day, and stay in good mood all day.
When we were kids, happiness was one thing, and when we had it, we had it; when we grew up, happiness was a goal, and when we got there, we found out that happiness was a mentality, and happiness when we got there.
To be the truest and most kind of yourself, to walk by heart, to live without regret; to live one way, to walk one's own way; to live two treasures of life: good body, good mood, beautiful life!
Each stage of life encounters a different kind of difficulty.
Many times, it's not the ability that binds you, it's the courage that actively confronts you.
If you can't hide, you should face it.
The more scared you are, the more difficult it is to be knocked out; if you're in trouble, the problem will eventually be solved.
The Zhong Shatsu exhibitor joined forces to host the first Saudi bi-annual exhibition of contemporary art - Xinhua Network
The first biennial exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia on 12 December in Riyadh, Xinhua (journalist Wang Haijia Hu Chong), was officially opened to the public on 11 December in the JAX Art District of Diriya, northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, etc.
The bi-annual exhibition was planned jointly by the Saudi Diary Bi-Year Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Yullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with the Director of Arts, Yullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, Yullens.
The theme of this bi-annual exhibition, according to the planning team, is " Touching the rocks across the river " , a strategy of reform adopted during the metaphorical socio-economic transition, which also reflects the current situation of socio-cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This bi-annual exhibition covers nearly 12,000 square metres and spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: " Touching the rocks across the river " , " Passing through as an experiment " , " Edge thinking " , " Walking to the public " "The beautiful new world" and "The spirit of the art."
Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than 40 per cent of the total number of exhibits in this exhibition, covering many forms, such as painting, device art and performing art; the work of 12 Chinese artists is also of interest, and some artists use recycled materials in novel ways for their creation, such as Xu Cicheng in the Infinite Chart of the Story Series Behind (2014), which recreates a classic mountain painting with waste.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public service job management - Xinhua Network
On December 12, the Xinhua news agency Kunming (journalist Lin Bei-soon) contributed to the overall revitalization of the country by promoting policies to promote rural revitalization of rural public service job management in order to sustain employment support for people living in poverty, consolidate the gains of expanding the fight against poverty.
The relevant head of the Yunnan Department of Human Rights said that, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448.3 million rural public service jobs for the employment of disadvantaged rural groups such as the poverty-free labour force, which play an important role in helping the people living in poverty to gain employment, consolidate the gains of poverty-eradication and effectively enhance the capacity of public services in rural areas.
The new regulations were issued jointly by the Yunnan Society, the Village Renewal, the Finance, and others. They regulate, inter alia, the scope, management of funds, job development and job management for the recruitment of rural public service personnel at the grass-roots level.
In terms of job development settings, the new regulations clearly state that they are set in accordance with the principle of "staffing on demand, manning, dynamic management, aggregate control " , "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person on duty, voluntary openness, unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the announcement, declaration, review, publicity, hiring, pre-service training and placement steps.
In addition, the new regulations specify the specific responsibilities of the main development sector for rural public service jobs, the criteria for subsidies for rural public service jobs and the manner in which subsidies are granted, stipulate that rural public service job development departments should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injuries for rural public service job placements; and require the relevant authorities to monitor the granting of rural public service job subsidies on a regular basis.

Two, while the right has a good age in history, it's not long, so it's short because it's a little sunshine, it's a little water, it's sweating; it's a little wishful, it's a big shock.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The positive significance of the right should not be denied from the end of the English-language definition of truth standards, the development of the economy to improve science and technology, and the promotion of administrative institutionalization and the guarantee of human rights.
Three, as far as I'm concerned, though not in full agreement with some of Li Weidong's claims, I care about his claims and respect the man Li Weidong; because he's serious, he's serious about China and takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, which I think is counter-necessary revolution, which inevitably leads to social unrest, loss of livelihood, political group fish and mud, and then foreign countries taking advantage of it.
Four, change or improve China's attitude of patience and accountability to the people, political speculation attempts to chestnuts in flames, which is not the right, but the asshole.
We'll talk to the left.
The left, actually, is a bunch of eras and political abandoned children.
If right is positive for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right words and analyze their ideas when needed, then there will be no such thing on the left, because what is left is what the Communist Party throws away!
Five, I don't think it's necessary to see some friends fighting back and forth against the left.
Don't even try to reason with the traitors and the left. It's all a band. It's ridiculous.
Don't try to prove that we're right, let alone try to get the traitors and the left to admit it. Why?
So I told my friends, when the traitors yell at you, and when the left scolds your right dog, it proves that our middle path is the right one!

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I feel like it's generally about restraint and freedom, and China's genes from the birth of history and culture cause China as a whole to be left-handed.

Don't say anything. Flowers are just like that.
In the last two years, the blockade and siege of China's chips by the U.S. Emperor has not only left China in unprecedented hardship, but also caused huge losses to the "American" business.
The direct consequence of the US Emperor's crackdown on the Chinese chip industry, which required its own businesses and ally-related businesses to block our chip industry at the same time, was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in lower research and development inputs and reduced capacity in chip-producing enterprises, thus creating a shortage of chip supply chains around the globe.
Today, the "lack of core" has spread across a wide range of industries around the world, such as car stoppages, cell phone price increases, and almost all industries that use chips have suffered from it.
In order to take ownership of the Chips, a growing number of country tech giants have begun to move towards the "de-aesthetic" path.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control, hold back the development of the semiconductor industry in China, the recent frequency of old American action and hosting of the Chip Summit; and again inviting the 64-nation giants to form a semiconductor coalition and to allocate funds to support the American home-grown technology giants, such as the American old tech giant Intel, in order to regain dominance in the chip field, to spend $20 billion to build two crystal-crystal processing plants in the United States of America and to open up the chip for public business.

In April this year, at the Master's think tank forum, Zhang Zhong said amazingly and ironically about Intel's effort to build the Crystal Circle factory: Zhang Zhong Zhong Zheng built the Chip Generation Factory.

By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips had been in the hands of a few powerful people.
The semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model at the time, and the chips, from design, manufacture to sealing, were done by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
The model, however, overwhelms some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only hope to do so in the face of huge production line construction costs.

soon after, Zhang's idea of Zhong scheme became a reality, and the build-up of electricity was brought about.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It was just created, and it was small in front of Intel, the giant.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So, Zhang Zhong scheme feels that Intel's entry into the Jingbing Dynasty is ironic.
The market value of the power build is now higher than Intel.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in the face of a powerful attack of power buildup, Intel naturally also dared not to assert itself.

First reported cases of Omichon strain infection in countries such as Mauritius - Xinhua Network
Xinhua Beijing, December 12 Consolidated Xinhua News Reporters Abroad: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first reported cases of new coronavirus Omichon strain infection.
c) Mauritius first reported two cases of Omichon strain infection in the country on 10 October.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpar, an infected visitor who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on 27 November; the other, a native resident of Mauritius, tested positive for nucleic acid on 30 November after contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
Following hospital quarantine, the results of both patients' nucleic acid tests were turned negative and are now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on 10th that the country had identified three cases of Omichon strain infection for the first time.
The three were students, returning from a trip abroad early this month, and were not admitted to hospital because they were mildly ill.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omichon strain, the Seymour government has continued to increase its controls.
From December 6 to January 10, next year, passengers over 12 who enter by air will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th day that it would begin vaccination of the country's children between the ages of 5 and 11 against the new Pfizer crown.
The Malawi Minister of Health, Kubize Chipunda, said on 9 September that the country had first found three cases of Omichon's drug strain infection.
The health sector in the country carried out genome sequencing of 12 new positive samples collected from 9 November to 2 December, and found three cases of infection.

Come to the store and start a series of tricks.
The first time I came to the store was to show them my house chart, they didn't go to the field to measure the house, they could actually offer me my 135 grand house, and probably show me their material and they didn't know what brand they were.
Their second set of tricks is that if you come to the store, you'll drag you in and pay the down money (and once this money is paid you'll never be able to back out unless you have enough experience with them to fight the theory).
When I hesitate to pay the down payment, they invite their so-called manager to tell you that you can give you as much credit as you can today by paying the down payment.
This is a big pit, and I'm an example of a living fraud, with more than 10,000 downsides when the mind rushes.
He gave me a lot of questions about the offer, not including utilities, not any doors and cupboards, bathrooms, and these three are the big cost of the basics.

I lost my trust in this company and let me sign the contract when I didn't say anything at first.
When I went to them to return the money, they showed a lot of experience, having a dedicated small team to deal with you.
No matter what, it's the client's problem that they're totally blameless.
There's a lot of details about the responsibilities, and I don't want to cry at all, so don't choose them anyway, because it's not good for my friends to look for the house they're renovating, and then count all the costs for you.

What are the differences between laser television and traditional television in market positioning?
In my understanding, traditional television, as the main subject, should refer to LCD, while the difference in market positioning between LCD and LCD is based on the following two main points:
First, laser television is more focused on the big screen market.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At present, mainstream LCD TV sizes are mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser television is typically 75 inches or more, the largest being over 100 inches, fully meeting users' needs for large screen coloring.
In recent years, the share of worldwide output and sales of laser television has been increasing, accounting for over 60 per cent of total television sales in 80 inches and above.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. Based on the principles of imaging of laser television flashes, light from laser light sources does not go straight into the eyeball, and the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions and less irritating to the eye than the back light source of liquid crystal television.
Qualification experts at the Saixi Laboratory and Beijing Concord Hospital of the Chinese Institute for the Standardization of Electronic Technology have produced 144 sets of test data by watching a rigorous comparison of laser and LCD television under the same conditions as the population.
The data confirm that laser television does have a strong eye-protective character and even a certain improvement in a particular context.
. In the current time when the health of eyesight is increasingly valued, laser television not only attracts more and more users with eye-protective advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color market.
The second is that laser television is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to LCD prices, most of the current prices for the sale of laser television are in excess of tens of thousands of dollars, and prices rise gradually as sizes and light sources rise.
What makes laser TV so expensive?
There's gotta be a point.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
With ultra-short focus projection technology, laser television projecting distance is shorter than traditional projecting equipment, allowing 100 inches of screen experience within a short distance, the space required is small and the host is small and occupies a small area.
. In terms of brightness, large brand laser television can reach more than 2,000 fluents.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In addition to this, many high-end laser television sets carry numerous frontier technologies such as real 4K ultra-high-resolution drawings, artificial intelligence systems, and imitation screens, which can bring even more shocking audio-visual experiences to users.
Quite apart from pseudo-demand, it's the product of a subdivision of demand, the theory of paint quality and input output ratio, laser television is not the type of video player who wants to balance screens and view the environment with insufficient, can be tried, everything has advantages and disadvantages, weighs his own judgment after, and is afraid of listening to one side of faith.
Quite simply, the ultra-wide angle close focus projector -- laser television -- had to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and mirrors to close the curtain, which was not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield some of the environmental light, the finel curtains using microstructures are expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced with a 65 inch liquid crystal.
And one more thing, I particularly hate the idea that projectors are good for their eyes with a flash of reflection. Come on, the light on the curtain that the eyes can see is a direct light for the eyes, you're a flash of reflection on the ceiling, you can't see it, and you can't see it. If it's not for realer LCD TV, it's a " straight shot" and open the TV ceiling, can't you see it too?
Moreover, the projection curtain would not have been like this if it had not been a flashback.
The hot spots (light spots) effect of the high-growth curtains are just ignored, with a large amount of light reflected to the eye at one angle, and that's really hard.

With a micromail appointment date, little sister sends me an optional schedule, which is more timely.
I looked at the filming in the store before I went, and more about the outdoor wedding dress, it was pretty, and it involved a lot of filming styles.

But maybe because I didn't share specific shooting ideas, it wasn't the way I wanted it, but it was a pretty good one.
After filming, the photographer will help pick the picture, communicate the late style, and feel a very careful bang.
It'll take about half a month to get the pieces fixed.
. The second time, the King's Dinner event, which wrote the real class, . . . most of the clothes on the whole scene were able to choose one shot.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It takes about two hours for the whole filming process, makeup+shooting, and the photographer in charge of filming is a younger brother after 95, feeling slightly or slightly green, hoping to give more advice later on in terms of action guidance for customers – a good talk, a good shoot.

Let's see Queenie, too.
You fill in your name phone and choose your dress, you can choose your wedding dress, you've been patient enough to change three or four costumes, you've been wearing makeup for a long time, you've got a good attitude of service, and then you'll get a shot of how you make it, and that's how you feel, like, half a month, three or four days, and it's like it's not different from the original.
[Environment] It's all right.
There's a lot of options.
The makeup position is almost three, and there's a studio in it.
[services] Very enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylist's kind of patient.
The photographer will also teach you your moves very carefully.

The brow's tail was also shaved, and it's a little awkward for not drawing brows on a daily basis.
The photo was given for 10 days, but the P chart was not very satisfactory, and it felt like the eyelids were still obvious.
Because I didn't know exactly what style to use, I tried two sets, and I picked them out, or I picked a black dress, and my sister said it was more Hepburn retrospect.
I've been getting my hair done since I picked out my clothes, and the hairdresser and the makeup artist's little sister are so patient that they're helping me get it out.
I've been taking pictures since my hair was done, and the photographers have been directing me all the way to pose, and it's easy to get along with it.
After the shoot, he took four of his favorite masteries, and his brother said it was 15 inches, and it ended with a great deal of satisfaction.
It's been 3 days without a reply... because your system can't identify my credit card, so I can't join the #PRS_ORG#plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is, every time I pay, I use the same credit card.
I have to pay freight every time.
You'll be excused. You'll get my monthly fee when you're done with the investigation, okay?
Small umbrellas for insurance. What do you think?
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In terms of setting conditions: According to the "Regulation of Insurance Brokers Regulation (revised 2015)" cue, three keywords must be met to become an insurance broker: shareholders, sponsors without a major violation record for the last three years, with a minimum limit of 50 million yuan to be established, and with the agreement of the China Insurance Board.
These three are really tough, and in sum they are strong, with the approval of the State authorities of the Silver Insurance Board (supervising insurance companies and banks throughout the country) and a good style for shareholders, as a small umbrella insurance for insurance brokers, who do not have to question too much whether small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, with these three thresholds, not all insurance companies can meet.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many company stars are sold on this platform, such as the most recent top-up and Tai SuperMary 5 heavy risk, and the claimants and insurers are Thai lives, and small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, without having to question its spectrometry.
In terms of the contribution model: the products of the Internet platform, because of the lower operating costs of the business network, and of the salaries of the operator, are more widely priced and paid in a flexible manner to support monthly payments, ease the contributor ' s contribution pressure and maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's still very good.
I can think about it.
. This is particularly important in terms of the professionalism of the staff: because insurance is a very professionally demanding industry, and many Internet product customers can be insured themselves, there are many errors, and in this area of health information and employment, non-insured practitioners tend to add their own subjective consciousness at the time of insurance, feel healthy or conform, so that there is a risk that many claims may be rejected.
I myself have been on the insurance phone sale in "The Quest Microsecurity" (like a small umbrella, also an Internet insurance brokerage platform) and have been very responsible for telling you.
The insurance of the Internet is real and reliable, and it's not human, there's no professional practitioner on the Internet channel and there's a lot of marketing misdirected.
For example, the $6 million insurance policy, the purchase of insurance for mobile phones, and the free receipt of 60,000 ICDs, which are not incorrect marketing strategies, are less important, but do not tell the insured that the first month, the next month, is subject to a normal fee, ranging from dozens to 200, and it is not clear what many customers have bought for themselves for a year or two.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The free delivery of the cell phone was sent at the end of the policy, such as the special policy section 666,8888, and if the winning text message was sent, it was not exchanged by itself, nor was it cautioned.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The State is also taking a heavy blow at the current misdirection of Internet insurance sales.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The main topic of the recommendation is considered in a comprehensive and careful manner, and in fact many of the belowline insurance brokerage companies have a wider product, customers have more options and products, and some of them have a better value than the Internet.
I myself helped 59 Internet customers, insured products under the line, and saved 2000-3000 dollars/year for each person.
If you have any questions, you're welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
I: Minya Insurance Broker, who has had three years of experience in business management training, has served nearly a thousand business users, has worked with over 100 insurance companies, and before I was insured, I would start from the customer's needs, tailor the insurance product for the customer, insure the customer, match the customer's goods to the customer's three, try to obtain the best possible nuclear security results for the customer, then arrange the insurance policy for the customer, and trust the insurance policy so that the customer can be assured.
Grow up with every client for life.
I hope my answer will help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulator, Internet insurance is the insurance business that the insured person can perform independently of the insurance process by clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the applicant does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be done by the insured person alone.
While Internet insurance coverage is not too "ceremonial" and may not even have a paper contract for a printed version, it does not in any way affect the validity and legal validity of electronic versions of contracts.
This model, somewhat similar to "telephone sales" generally streaming line operations, but so buying insurance would also have a fatal problem, which is that - follow-up services may not keep up.
Is insurance usually a decades-long contract, and when we buy insurance, should we think seriously about the "intermediary" we choose, or is it an "insurance broker" who can be with us for a long time and will provide services to us many years later?
So how do I get in touch with the delivery commissioner?
It's almost 3:00.
Is that for me?
I told you to knock and deliver.
But the rider left it at the door, and the man left.
It's still wrong.
Your rider has taken me a take-out, but it's still in the waiting room.
The rider received my take-out at 19:25, but still won't leave.
I'll go get it. I'll get some other takeaways.
What do we do?
Where's your rider?
Waiting?
I'm here to deliver the bill.
Okay, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police.
But there's a safety problem with my food.

Just get back to the code.
No problem. No need to arrange a reload. I've bought another one. I don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
I have been opposed to any form of defamation and verbal abuse from before and now, and I can't accept such physical assault.
In a civilized society, we can accommodate everything, but it's to put an end to this villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it's this uncivilized style that you have to resist first.
I've been unresponsive since you started sending Facebook and friends' requests, and then publishing tactful posts, and before you try to post the so-called place of my home and father's name on social media.
You're not just going to keep tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, but even more on Facebook with your so-called friends, and you're going to continue to discuss some of my obscure, humiliating remarks, looks, body sizes, good breeding, any kind of bed-breathing, or any kind of stick-in messages, and I'm...
I didn't know I'd received more from a number of friends about your Facebook friend's family posting a photo of you and a statement with a sexual harassment component.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't keep quiet anymore.
When I called the news, you didn't take it down at all, but you got even more aggressive.
I don't care what political background you are, and whatever status you are, in our society, you need to be respected by both sexes.

That's right, I can't, I can't, I can't stop you.
I don't want to know you, I don't want to know you. I don't need your opinion.
I don't even think there's a girl who's willing to let someone else humiliate herself so much for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said yes, and you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after she's been so bullied.
No matter what the job, society, politics or business, only those who do not even have basic virtues will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart.
I stopped some of the messages to the judges.
I don't think anyone can pretend to be you.
All I can say is that you're a civil enemy.
I'm gonna laugh.
Viet Nam People ' s News Network - Prime Minister Van Ming of the Government of Viet Nam is attending the Third National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum in Viet Nam
During the third National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum in Viet Nam, two major meetings were held, focusing on the two main themes of digital technology enterprises and the digital transformation of the country, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development in the context of and after the new corona pneumonia outbreak.
The Minister of Communications and Media, Nguyen Meng-hsiung, said that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the new corona pneumonia epidemic, the number of digital technology enterprises and operating revenues in Viet Nam continued to grow, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, the typical number of digital products in Viet Nam was cultivated, focusing on the major challenges faced by Viet Nam, many digital products having gone out of the country and Viet Nam's digital technology ranking had been raised.
Minister Nguyen Meng-hsiung called on digital technology enterprises to assume responsibility for the development of national digital transformation platforms, and the task of developing these national digital platforms was to assume the national mission.
At the forum, heads of departments and State institutions are studying, developing, applying, transferring enterprises of digital technology, and organizations and individuals have shared breakthrough ideas and solutions for mobilizing and pooling the resources of society as a whole to develop technological enterprises in Viet Nam, working together to promote national digital transformation, economic recovery after the outbreak of Zhu Hui.
In his address to the forum, Prime Minister Van Ming emphasized that digital transformation is the way the world must be, the objective need for development.
The digital transformation has become a global problem, with digital transformation serving the entire population and thus mobilizing the participation of the entire population.
The people and businesses are at the heart of the digital transformation, the subjects, the goals and the dynamics.
Therefore, all policies need to be for the benefit of the people and the business.
Prime Minister Van Ming emphasized that digital transformation needed to reflect the national spirit, that it needed to be based on internal forces, strategies, long-term and decisive factors, and external forces as important and breakthroughs.
At the same time, he argued that digital transformation needed to drive deep and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the new coronary pneumonia outbreak, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome natural resource depletion, contribute to the green transformation and develop green energy.
The digital transformation needs to be involved in the development of databases for the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, and national landscapes, as well as in the promotion of digital transformation in the areas of banking, taxation, land management and development of databases and logistics.
The greatest goal of the digital transformation is to make the people happier and the country more prosperous.
Prime Minister Van Mingzheng asked all levels of government, institutions and businesses at all levels to increase leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, raise awareness of the digital transformation, continue to develop and improve institutions for digital transformation, strengthen national governance and promote the development of digital technology enterprises in a spirit of respect, communication, listening and active and proactive.
During the Forum, Prime Minister Van Myung-chung attended the 2021 "Vietnam makes" award ceremony for excellence in digital products and the opening of the "Vietnam makes" digital product exhibit.
I've reported, I've attached pictures, but I haven't responded.
What cow? No bulls.
It's a saliva chicken. It's raw meat.
I can't eat it.
You make sure it's freshly cooked food, not old ones?
Unacceptable
It's been on the list for a long time.
Says it's late at 7:00.
Why remake it?

The Yangtze Dry Stream achieves full coverage of the Aquatic Green Integrated Service Area - Xinhua Network
On December 11, Xinhua news agency Wuhan (journalist Wang Xian) completed 10 days of completion of the Green Integrated Service Area on the Shia Mausoleum, the 2nd officially operating water-based Green Integrated Service Area upstream of Yangjiang, following the 8-day suspension of the Water Integrated Service Area in Zhuizhou, Sichuan Province.
By this point, the Aquatic Green Integrated Service Area had covered the Yangtze, centre, and downstream.
The Deputy Director of the Jiang Air Administration, Kew, Minister of Transport, said that previously, the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu were already in the middle of the Yangtze River and had been built downstream to operate 10 water-green integrated service areas, endorsed by a wide range of crews, which played an important role in advancing the high-quality development of Yangtze shipping.
The full coverage of the water-based green integrated service area is another milestone in the construction of the Yangtze green shipping industry, with the Yangtze ship receiving pollutants and a significant increase in shipping service capacity.
The Aquatic Green Integrated Service Area was described as an important facility for a wide range of ships, crews providing all-round production, life services, and helping a wide range of crews to solve the "graceful" problem.
The construction of two operational water-green integrated service areas in the upper Yangtze, combining life-services, production services and government services, with the theme of green environment, featuring ship maintenance and ship emergency relief services, will make the ships in the port " one-time berthing, multiple services " , which will make the crews sailing in the Yangtze more efficient and easier to live.
The U.S.-Three carriers amassed around China with the most powerful weapons rare to visit Guam 2022-01-17 multi-dimensional pro-China media Do-Wi coverage: US-China relations update: latest satellite imagery shows three American carriers are amassing around China; the US-Media also reveals that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal visits Guam and sends important signals to the United States allies and opponents in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank Strategic Posture Awareness Platform in the South China Sea, on January 9, the satellite discovered the carrier of the USS Carl Vinson near the Balabak Strait.
The Balabak Strait connects the South and Sulu Seas and is a strategic location on the Western Pacific First Island chain.
The platform anticipates that the Carl Vincensen will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This was the first time that the carrier Carl Vincent had carried F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Fishhawks on board transport aircraft for deployment.

In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the United States Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the USS Ronald Reagan carrier, who is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also included the Champlain Lake missile cruiser, the Stockdale missile destroyer, and so on.
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Posture Awareness Platform released an updated satellite picture showing three American carriers amassing around China.
The U.S. carrier assembled around China, the most powerful weapons rare to visit Guam on January 17, 2022, on the flight route of CMV-22B, a United States warship-mounted transport aircraft.

The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, with 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the United States Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (15 January).
The U.S.-Three carriers amassed around China with the most powerful weapons rare to visit Guam, which, according to analysis, sends a signal to allies and enemies in an increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The U.S.-Three carriers amassed around China with the most powerful weapons to visit Guam, and China has built a large number of military facilities in the South Sand Islands in recent years.
The figure is that China is on Yongsun Island in the South Sand Islands.
In a statement, the United States Navy said that the visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada had strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating the capabilities, flexibility, readiness of the United States and its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
The ballistic missile submarine is commonly known as the Boomer submarine.
The whereabouts of 14 Thunder Submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make the Thunder Submarine "the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad", a system that also includes launch well ballistic missiles located on American soil, as well as bombers with nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about Meta's recent fall of 26%, market value evaporation, $25.1 billion, Zuckerberg's response to "exceeding unprecedented competition", for what reason?
. Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenue derived mainly from advertising, and today's profit-making advertising company, which has its own flow channels.
- Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. - Whatever the functional location, it's Meta's traffic channel.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But the times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple privacy policy, Meta has difficulty getting data information from users again, affecting the efficiency of advertising placements.
The Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it will be clear whether Apps are allowed to access their own information, and most people's normal reaction is certainly not allowed.
Next thing you know, if Google stabs again, it'll have a bigger impact on Meta's income.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in the previous income growth of Meta has also weakened (the weight of this factor is not certain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows Meta doesn't have a business in China, but that's not an accurate understanding.
Every year, at least 10 per cent of Meta's income comes from China, mainly the contribution of companies that make sea operations in China.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about a few hundred people, and there are several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand the overseas market, Meta is a bypassing advertising channel, and most of the burning money is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the TT now is one of Meta's main competitors, but the first two years Meta made a lot of money from the byte.
Every agent in the country is helping with the byte, Meta, where they advertise, and Meta Greater China is doing a great job.
I haven't been special lately, but I'm sure it won't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale burning of money by Chinese companies abroad has passed.
Thirdly, the new flow channels have not expanded well.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platform, including TT, is not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a drop in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital markets look not only at middle income, but more importantly at what is expected in the future.
It's obvious that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg spoke of the meta-cosmos.
The meta-cosmos should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the meta-cosmos have a longer implementation cycle, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two three years.
So for the next two years, it's supposed to be a tough time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook as it is now, with an income of between $100 billion and $200 billion a year, in fact Facebook is now very dangerous and has no good safe moat compared to other Internet businesses and high-tech companies.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And the idea of the meta-cosmos, which has no prospect of success at all in a short time, makes Facebook very dangerous, and that's why Zuckerberg changed the company's name again, and was constantly searching for the root cause of the new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, it's a way not to go back, and that's some of my thoughts, for information.
