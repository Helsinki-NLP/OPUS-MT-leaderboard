According to British media, the United States Navy's Deputy Minister for Operations, Admiral William Moran, continued to expand the Asia-Pacific region to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific Ocean – as the Navy focused – even as the United States Navy was revitalizing its forces to deal with increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
According to the UK website Jane's Defence Weekly on September 24, the United States included Central Russia as a strategic competitor in its new defence strategy, which was announced earlier in the year.
Since then, the U.S. Navy has resumed its second fleet in order to confront Russia's activities more directly.
The report states that these moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts about the possibility that the U.S. Navy might move away from the "Asia Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marked Obama's administration.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At a round table discussion entitled "Addressing the High Seas Challenge" hosted by the National Asian Research Bureau of the United States in Washington on 24 January 2018, he said, " For us, no major changes have taken place. "
Moran said, " The focus remains on rebalancing, shifting the focus or whatever you want to describe it ... "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He said, " We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do ... "
While Moran noted that the overall policy on Russia was within the purview of the U.S. Secretary of Defense, he warned, " Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we clash with them, they will be very tough ... "
General Moran said that the United States Navy was dynamically deploying troops into a " new mode of warfare " , as part of a renewed operation by the United States against Russia, China and other competitors, which would help to surprise opponents as to where the American carrier battle group or other assets would be deployed at any given time and location.
He said, " We, the Navy and the Marines, support it — the concept of unpredictability of warfare, do not appear in the same place again and again, almost like hairs — — that's how we do it. "
The first attempt at such a new approach was reported to have been the "Harry Truman" carrier battle group, whose early deployment included working visits to ports and patrolling in areas normally only passed.
. . . . . . . . Moran said that the U.S. Navy was currently working to ensure that allies were aware that the warships would still patrol the traditional areas, and was also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment procedures.
The Royal Australian Navy Commander, Lieutenant General Michael Nunan, also spoke at the event, saying that the Australian Army could work seamlessly with American carriers in combat.
He said that the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy planned to procure nine additional frigates equipped with a "Zeus Shield" operational system.
A number of airlines have been moving up or restoring fuel surcharges since October 5, and we're going to need extra money for the flight next Friday.
Yesterday, airlines such as Cheung Peng Air and Okai Air announced to the public that since 5 October 2018 (the date of the ticket issue), each passenger on a domestic route has received an additional fuel charge of $20 for fuel and a surcharge of $30 for fuel for each passenger on a route of more than 800 kilometres.
The companies Cheung Peng Air, Okai Air announced that, starting at 0:00 (date of ticket offer) on 5 October 2018, the standard for charging fuel surcharges on domestic routes below 800 kilometres (inclusive) rose from $10/person to $20/person, and the standard for charging surcharges on fuel surcharges on domestic routes above 800 kilometres increased from $10/person per passenger to $30/person.
The children, the military and police, were all $10/person; the babies continued to be exempted.
According to the official responsible for the airline ticket, the airline has stated in its notice that the charge for fuel surcharges is based on the date of the original ticket, and that, in exchange for passenger tickets, the surcharge for fuel is not refunded.
This means that domestic route tickets, which were paid before October 5, do not have to be replenished with fuel surcharges in accordance with the new standards if they are to be changed to 5 October.
On 5 June 2018, a number of airlines, including National Airlines, East Airlines, Sea Navigation, Shanghai Airlines, Spring Autumn Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Western Airlines, and Okai Airlines, resumed collecting fuel surcharges for domestic routes, which had been cancelled for three years, at a standard rate of $10/person.
This time, Cheung Peng Air, Okai Air, took the lead in announcing an increase in fuel surcharge, and as of the time of the reporter's release, no news of the country's four major airlines announcing a follow-up to the adjustment has been received.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department provides that airlines may decide to charge fuel surcharges on their own as of November.
The first announcement was made on 27 September by KMT that fuel surcharges would be recollected as of 2 November.
The Taitai Aviation website shows that all tickets issued or reissued by Taitai and Taithai Dragon Airlines on or after 2 November will contain fuel surcharges, long-distance flights to and from Hong Kong and the South-West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, flights to and from Africa, fuel surcharges of $652 and short-distance flights of $146.
The cost applies to all ticket types, calculated on the basis of each leg, and includes fare quotations from all direct outlets in the country.

In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked past the headquarters of the Maru Hongji Society.
In turn, Maru Hong said that he had suspended his financial transactions in agriculture under the banner of the trade war hit the United States grain sector, Gao-hung.
Before, some heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies and others in Japan had issued warnings about the effects of friction in trade between China and the United States when they published their latest performances, and these Japanese trade unions have now joined the ranks.
The United States and China are collecting tariffs on goods of hundreds of billions of dollars each other, and the President of the United States Trump threatens to extend the tax to more than $500 billion of Chinese lost goods if the dispute is not resolved.
. Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Ito Zhong commercial finance chief, said that trade disputes could have a greater impact on the Chinese economy next year.
Ito Zhong commercials and the Thai Bumblebee Group invested $10 billion in 2015 in China, earning 20 per cent of their shares.

On November 5 of China's New Network, a comprehensive report states that the midterm election vote in the United States has entered the countdown.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents were active in "clarification" to their core electorate.
Both parties noted that voter turnout would be the key to the right and the right.
. . . . . . . . . 48 hours before the American popular vote, Trump was reportedly busy attending the Republican candidate's campaign, and former President Barack Obama went to Indiana, where he stood for the Democratic Federal Senate candidate, Joe Donnelly, who was anxious for the election, and called out to the crowd for a final claim before the election.
On 4 November, Trump went to Meigan, Georgia, to stand for Republican candidate for governor, Brian Kemp, who said, " You have to go to the polling station on Tuesday and you have to vote. "
"The comparison of this election cannot be clearer... "
The voter's political enthusiasm rose to a rare peak, and early voting in some states was far beyond normal.
The successive Presidents of the United States face the first mid-term election, and the number of members of Parliament from the party to which he belongs tends to decrease.
According to a new poll published by the Washington Post and the United States Broadcasting Corporation News Network (ABC News) on 4th, while the Democratic Party's federal House of Representatives election remains dominant, Republicans can benefit from economic assessments and Trump's strict attention to border security.
The poll showed that registered voters preferred the Democratic House of Representatives more candidates than Republicans, 50 per cent to 43 per cent, but that there was still a drop in the lead of 14 percentage points compared to August.
Another poll by the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and The Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats were still 7 percentage points ahead of Republicans.

The People's Network Beijing's 5 November electricity (King Xiaoyan) in the current wave of "public entrepreneurship, crowd innovation" has seen an increasing number of technology companies begin to value patent research and development and related protection efforts, digging deep into the potential value of patents and taking over market dominance.
In the same vein, there are a number of technologies that have experienced numerous torts in patenting technology authorizations, the use of patented technology, etc.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei from Guangdong Province, Ho Zhanghong, and the three Ribins sued the developer of the Drop Out of the APP, Beijing Orange Technology Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Orange Technology Ltd.), the operator drop out of the APP Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Drop Out), and the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the Guangdong Pacific Ocean), to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately cease manufacturing, selling, promising to sell, and using the plaintiff's patent.
On 30 October 2018, China's Judicature Network published " Civil Decisions on First Instance Disputes over Invention Patent Rights between Tan Wei, Ho Zhanghong, and Beijing Orange Technology Ltd " , revealing some details of cases in which the drop-out of the APP was sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs argued that "movable terminal-based carpool service systems and methods " patented patent rights holders and inventors, while the entire operating process of the "windmill" application in the "drop-out" APP corresponded to the technical options for patent protection in question, constituting patent infringement.
. However, during the court's decision, Orange Tech argued that the Guangdong Pacific Ocean was not an appropriate defendant, that it simply provided free downloads on the web of the APP's "drop-out" involved, that it did not apply the patent method involved, that there were no direct or indirect torts, and that it should not be listed as the defendant in the case.
Second, the violation was not in Guangdong.
In accordance with the law, the place of infringement of the patent in question should be the place where the patent method in question was applied in its entirety, and therefore challenged the jurisdiction of the court, requesting that the case be referred to the court of the defendant ' s domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, had provided the alleged tortuous drop-out of APP products on its web platform and that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant, Guangdong Pacific.
And the defendant, the Guangdong Pacific Residence, is located in Guangzhou City, within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Orange Tech, claimed to refer the case to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, on insufficient grounds, dismissing the defendant, Orange Tech Ltd.'s challenge to jurisdiction in the case and bearing the costs of the jurisdiction challenge case.
The other proceedings in the case have not yet been published, and journalists will also follow up on the drop-out patent infringement case.
Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research: The results of the Australasian science and technology cooperation are significant
" China ' s science and technology have developed rapidly over the past decades, and the two countries of Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by working together in the field of science. "
The Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research, Larry Marshall, said in a recent interview with a reporter from China News Agency in Beijing, that Australian cooperation in the field of science and technology was a lively demonstration from cooperation on climate change to the Sky Eye project.
As the largest national scientific institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many innovative and world-famous research findings in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, and astronomy.
The CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In May of this year, China ' s 500 m Sphere Radio Telescope — China Sky Eye — installed the first international 19-beam L-band receiver.
This is currently the most advanced international 19-beam feed receiver, developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists.
The successful development of the receiver, said Marshall, was based on CSIRO's multi-year accumulation of technology, which, with its launch, would result in a five to sixfold increase in the speed of the FAST skyscraper and, at the same time, would expand more scientific observation targets.
"It is a force that CSIRO has contributed to the FAST. "
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO is working closely with Chinese scientific institutions in the construction of a square kilometre array radio telescope, the development of new fuel technologies, and energy-efficient emission reductions.
" Past scientific research tends to focus on issues that are more than a hundred years old, and now more scientific power is needed to solve the problems before it ... "
According to Marshall, the two countries of Australia are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a range of challenges in development.
. Extreme weather, for example, is frequent around the globe, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, the problems of population explosion, ageing, chronic disease and so on are serious challenges.
" The cooperation between the two countries in recent years has been primarily aimed at resolving these current challenges ... "
According to Marshall, CSIRO, together with the National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology in Qingdao, focuses on observing the El Niño phenomenon and the La Niña phenomenon, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather; new varieties of cereals to overcome extreme weather, developed by CSIRO in conjunction with the Central College, can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
" In the present environment, where science, technology and innovation are difficult to accomplish on their own, where the costs are extremely high, and where there are a lot of issues to be addressed, cooperation is particularly important today ... "
. Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more groundbreaking progress is possible, and that is the meaning of enhanced cooperation between the two sides in Australia within the framework of the "one way along."
" to strengthen bilateral cooperation, primarily in science and technology ... "
. Marshall, for example, CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, which is very harmful to the environment because traditional cyanide gold purification methods are very harmful to the environment, and many countries wish to find a gold purification method that is less polluting to the environment.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our engagement in ‘across the way' cooperation. "

The DPRK Foreign Minister Li Yong Ho stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions was deepening North Korea ' s distrust of the United States and that North Korea could not unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
According to Li Yong-ho at the United Nations General Assembly, the DPRK has taken a " very friendly approach " over the past year, including the cessation of missile and nuclear testing, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and a commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
" If we don ' t trust the United States, we don ' t have confidence in our national security, in which case we can ' t give up our weapons unilaterally first. "
While Li Yong-ho repeated North Korea's complaint against the "phased" denuclearization of the United States, his remarks were of great significance, as there was no complete rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea had done before.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The United States also refused to relax its demand for international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insisted on ‘denuclearization first ' and increased pressure on sanctions to achieve their purpose in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to issue a ‘Statement of the End of War ' , " Lee Yong Ho called it.
"The idea that sanctions can make us kneel and beg for forgiveness is that people who don't know us are having daydreams.
But the problem is that this ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust... "
Li Yong-ho did not mention the second Tkin conference plan mentioned by the President of the United States earlier this week at the United Nations.
On the contrary, he stressed that Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Wen had met three times in the past five months and stated: " If the other side of the denuclearization was South Korea rather than North Korea, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not become so deadlocked. "
China announced that it would reduce import tariffs for 1585 tax purposes as of 1 November 2018.
Since this year, China has taken successive initiatives to reduce import tariffs.
This year, on 1 May, a total reduction in taxes on medicines, including all generic drugs and bioalkali drugs with anti-cancer effects, with a total of 28 tax purposes, such as actual imports of Chinese medicine, adjusted to zero.
At the same time, production of anti-cancer drugs has been reduced considerably, and import chain value added tax (VAT) charges have been imposed.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . on July 1. . . .
Following the reduction of taxes, China's car-wide tax rates were lower than the average in developing countries and were in line with the actual Chinese automotive industry.
This reduction will drive industry restructuring and optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the gains and losses, help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to contribute to some extent to the adjustment of automobile prices and increase consumer benefits.
On July 1, taxes were reduced on consumer goods on a daily basis for 1449 tax purposes.
The daily reduction of taxes on consumer goods is closely linked to the needs of people for a good life.
The tax reduction was not only large but strong, with an average of 56%.
The daily consumer goods tax is reduced to the direct benefit of a wide range of consumers and to promote greater competitiveness in domestic industries.
On 1 November, taxes will be imposed on industrial goods such as mechanical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials for 1585 tax purposes.
The appropriate reduction of import tariffs on some of the much-needed industrial goods in the country can attract more foreign investment, contribute to increased domestic efficient supply, contribute to industrial upgrading, and contribute to the global allocation of resources by enterprises, reduce production costs and reduce domestic environmental burdens.
The head of the Office of the Customs and Excise Commission of the State Council of China explained that the above-mentioned four autonomous tax cuts, as well as the third step, implemented on 1 July of this year as a result of negotiations on the expansion of the information technology agreement, would reduce China ' s overall tariff level from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than in the EU, is lower than most developing countries and is at a moderate low level and is essentially in line with China ' s developing country status and development phase.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that the overall level of tariffs as one of the important indicators of openness in the area of Chinese trade in goods should be adapted to the stage of China's economic development, reflecting the characteristics of the era.
The world's first largest trade in Chinese goods already has an economic basis for further expansion of openness, but the quality and benefits of trade development differ from those of developed economies, and therefore the overall level of tariffs should be reduced as appropriate.
duties are a means of protecting compliance, and tariff levels should be commensurate with industrial competitiveness, encourage good competition, and overprotect industry development and improve quality.
The tariff rate adjustment needs to balance production needs with consumer demand.
The focus on lowering domestic demand is large, contributing to higher commodity tariffs for industrial transformation, working to increase the import of niche products with a more concentrated demand of the population, increasing the sense of access for businesses and the public, and meeting the need for upgrading industrial and consumer structures.
The tax reduction effort needs to balance fiscal revenue with the affordability of industrial development.
The choice of specific tax-deductive goods and tax-deductive margins needs to be integrated and coordinated between domestic and foreign markets, and between upstream and downstream production and consumption in order to preserve the medium-to-good development momentum of China's economy.
The Officer-in-Charge stressed that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening up, and that China ' s initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is based on China ' s own major initiatives to achieve high-quality development needs, facilitating the integrated use of both international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of domestic supply systems and meeting the needs of the people ' s mass consumption escalation.
This action and initiative demonstrate China's firm commitment to a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, its firm support for economic globalization, its firm commitment to the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system, with the WTO at its core, and its continued drawing on the dynamic of development from openness to the world and making China's development more beneficial to the world.
Serbia has declared a state of maximum operational readiness and President Sérgio will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
Quoted by the Serbian President's Office, the President of Serbia, Vucić, ordered the country's armed forces to enter a state of maximum operational readiness, given the occupation by the Kosovo Special Forces of the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric plant in northern Kosovo, which was controlled by the Belgrade side.
The Serbian Minister of Defence, Wulin, declared on 29 September that the Serbian army was in full operational readiness.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to Russian Tas, on 29 September, Vucić stated in an interview that he had informed the parties, including the US and Russia, of the current situation and that he would travel to Moscow on 2 October to meet with Russian President Putin to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked if Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vucić gave the negative answer: " I don ' t want a major military conflict on our territory. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The reason the Serb army was raised to be operational is related to two major moves on the Kosovo side.
In recent days, according to the Serbian side, Albanians have been making large arrests in northern Kosovo of Serbs living there for generations, and these arrested Serbs have not broken any laws.
According to Vucić, since 26 March this year, the head of the Serbian government office in Kosovo and Metohija, Marco Yurić, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Albanian army, the Albanian community has escalated the situation in the area, carrying out inhumane arrests and deportations of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including armed police and snipers, of the previously self-declared Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, ROSU Special Forces, occupied positions near the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric plant, entered the ecological and sports centre near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo and blocked all nearby roads, which were otherwise controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucić notes that this military adventure in Kosovo was carried out with the encouragement of Western countries and that the Kosovo Army's actions did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, and of Security Council resolution 1244 and the military-technical agreement between Seko.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The root cause of this conflict is still a centuries-old historical grudge between the two communities in the Kosovo region.
There are separate claims about the attribution of Kosovo, the Serb and the Albanian communities.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Albanians, for their part, insisted that the original tribe of Illyria, which lived in Kosovo in the 4th-5th century BC, was an ethnic Albanian ancestor, and that, therefore, Kosovo had been an ethnic Albanian territory since ancient times.
The subjective political division has resulted in intense conflict among different ethnic, religious and cultural groups, leading to a fierce confrontation between the Serb and Albanian communities in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
In the aftermath of World War I, large numbers of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, with a relative increase in the Serb share, and the practice of "only taking back their own land" in the eyes of Serbs, which was exacerbated by the plundering of Albanians as "Greater Serbs" and bi-communal contradictions.
Kosovo became a " gunpowder barrel " in the Balkans.
In 1999, armed clashes between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO troops and the outbreak of war in Kosovo.
On February 17, 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Since then, although there have been news that Serbia will normalize its relations with Kosovo and sign global and legally binding agreements, agreements that are subject to multilateral forces such as the United States and Europe, due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints, have not been able to be concluded.
Just a month ago, for the first time, Vucić explicitly advocated the separation of Serbs from Albanians in Kosovo and once again made the bi-communal contradiction public.
The power lines are still out, and Indonesia is in a lot of trouble with the tsunami rescue.
According to figures published by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early morning of 30, a strong earthquake and tsunami in Dingala district in the Central Sulawesi province of the country occurred on 28 October, killing 420 people.
The head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Wilem Rampanilei, said that the figure was only a preliminary count of the city of Palu, capital of Central Sulawesi, about 80 km from the epicenter, because of the lack of large search and rescue machinery and the fact that many of the city's dense buildings, including hotels, malls, warehouses, and other buildings, had not been searched for as a result of the earthquake.
On 29 September 2018 local time, Baru, Indonesia, a bridge damaged by earthquakes and tsunamis collapsed into several knots.
As a result of severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the epicenter of the town of Dingala and the adjacent Sighi area remain unconnected "onions " , and it is not possible to count the number of victims.
The media reported that Vice President Kara of Indonesia had stated that the death toll or thousands of people had been lost.
Power breaks, communications breaks, roads are blocked, airports are damaged... and rescue efforts following the earthquake and tsunami are difficult.
As a result of power interruptions, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu city need to be powered by fuel.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus, stated that emergency relief supplies, such as mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and household kits, had not yet arrived in the affected areas as a result of road damage, which the Ministry had transferred from the provinces of South Sulawesi and Colontolo in the immediate vicinity of the earthquake zone.
The relief materials shipped from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the affected areas via air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the Palu airport command tower and runway during the earthquake, all commercial flights have been suspended to ensure safety and security of rescue, for the landing and landing of only military aircraft transporting relief supplies and personnel.
The Indonesian politics in charge of rescue in the earthquake zone, the Minister for Legal and Security Coordination, Vilanto, requested that power supply and airport commercial flight services be restored as soon as possible in order to ensure the functioning of rescue agencies such as hospitals, to allow more rescue personnel and volunteers and to allow aid supplies to reach the affected areas.
There were several strong earthquakes in Dingala district in Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, on 28 September, in which a magnitude 7.7 earthquake at 1702 local time triggered a tsunami that caused a major disaster in the city of Palu, Dingara district, and the Sigi region.
In recent days, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky model, drawing thousands of people to the social platform to shine their happiness on the continuous screen, calling "under the blue sky clouds, the 'drunk' skyline, which is the best business card in Beijing."
. . . . . . . . . . . . since August, Beijing has received "the bluetest sky."
In the city, people can be seen anywhere or with smartphones, or pictured with a single back camera.
On social platforms such as microblogs, microbred friend circles, the home palaces, Tiananmen, bird nests, hulls that can be seen everywhere are different buildings that display different beauty under the blue sky's lining.
. . . . . . . . . . . is the best urban propaganda in Beijing; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Why do the people of Kyushu love the blue sky?
As the people who lived in this city in the past suffered from the haze, they were particularly thirsty for the blue sky, and after the continued improvement of air quality in Beijing, the haze was reduced and the blue sky increased, and the sense of happiness gained was particularly significant in the eyes of the people.
On the day of the Fourth of July, the weather in Beijing was clear.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring sites in the city showed green as "first-class excellence".
The people's spontaneous "Blackest Sky" thematic photography contest on the social platform is still ongoing.
Why is it so blue in recent Beijing?
In August this year, the average concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 μg/m3, according to the relevant head of the Beijing City Environmental Protection Agency, which is the best record for the same period in nearly five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September is more frequent in bits.
A major factor in the emergence of the "most blue sky" is the overall favourable weather conditions in recent times, and, more importantly, the persistence of atmospheric pollution management in Beijing, the vigorous promotion of clean air action plans over the past five years, and the continued release of environmental benefits, which have resulted in a reduction in the region's total pollutant emissions, all of which have laid the foundation for continuous improvement in air quality.
. Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing City Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, the official direction of non-capital functional decomposition continued, advancing energy clean-up substitution and pollution reduction efforts, bringing the total to 4923 coal-fired boilers.
. Beijing thus became the first major city in the Mainland of China to achieve a full-network gasification.
The data show that the average annual PM2.5 concentration in Beijing decreased by 35.6 per cent between 2013 and 2017; the number of days of air quality achievement increased by 50; the number of good first-degree days increased by 25; and the number of heavy-pollution days decreased by 35 days, with a marked decrease in the incidence of heavy pollution.
While air quality continues to improve, Beijing officially released in September of this year a three-year plan of action based on a new round of PM2.5 sources for the Blue Sky Defence War, focusing on the current phase of governance and pollution characteristics, focusing on diesel trucks, dust-raising, volatile organic matter governance, optimizing transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures and land use structures, strengthening regional anti-control controls, investing in fine city management, promoting green development, and striving to have "the blue sky" stay in Kyoto City and no longer "the rare is the main character" to return it to the background of people ' s album rather than the main character.
During this year's National Day Gold Week, the relevant departments, such as the City Tourism Commission, business, city authorities, and public security, will intensify their law enforcement checks on the "one-day tour" market, focusing on tourist "six black" messes, and those who violate the law will be subject to heavy and heavy penalties in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the city government held a special session on the illegal "One Day Tour" to deploy a special operation to further the illegal "One Day Tour".
It was revealed at the meeting that the focus black ticket, black guide, black club, black car, black store, black web interest chain interlocking "six black" messes, and that the city has launched an illegal "one day tour" campaign since July 28.
The campaign has been launched so far, and the city has received 39 "One Day Tour" complaints, down 63% from the same time; since this year, the city has received 270 " One Day Tour" complaints, down 62% from the same time.
In recent two years, the city has seized 248 Black Cars, 158 violations of the regulations in tourist passenger operations, 29 shopping "Black Shops" and show venues, 13 Blacks, 27 Black Guides, 26,000 illegal advertisements, 31 illegal "One Day Tour" billboards, 3 bus fakes, 1789 offences in various categories of tourism offences, 181 cases filed by various functional departments, from a heavy fine of $4.48 million to detain 111 persons involved in brigade offences.
Following the overhaul, the illegal "one day tour" of the mess was largely contained, and the "one day tour" market order presented a steady medium-to-good state of affairs.
It is described that in recent years the city has been increasing its efforts to combat illegal "one day trip".
In 2016 and 2017, the City Board of Tourism received 1612 and 897 "One Day Swim" complaints, a decrease of 79 per cent and 44 per cent, respectively, but illegal "One Day Swimming" continued to be repeated, with frequent rebounds and the formation of the interlocking "six black" disorder of interest chains such as black ticketing, black conduction, black car, black store, and black net.
In particular, illegal street visitors, i.e., "Black Tickets", illegal websites that publish false tourist information, "Black Web", travel agencies or agencies or individuals who do illegal "one-day trips" or do not have travel agencies operating qualifications, "Blacks", and "Black Guides" for guided tours without a guided tour license or irregular practice, for vehicles with no tourist passenger qualifications used or for which passenger services are provided for illegal "one-day trips", or "Black Cars", for designated tourist shopping shops that they eventually bring tourists into.
In this special operation, the city continued to increase its regular inspections and mobile patrols of illegal "one-day trips", in response to illegal "one-day trips" with high frequency and high impact tourist line points, and the relevant authorities sent daily undercover teams to take undercover visits to the mission, where they found evidence of violations and violations, and were subject to strict scrutiny in accordance with the law.
Among them, "Black Cars" and "Black Shop" became two tight focus of the special operations.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The relevant departments use road traffic surveillance probes to increase regulation of the priority "one-day tour" route tourist bus, which can be detected in a timely manner by technical and physical intelligence means.
The tourist shopping "black store" also became a strong focus due to its small number and its sit-in operation.
In order to intensify the deterrence and repression of illegal "one-day trips", whenever a violation is found to have been committed in a special operation, all functional units are subject to heavy and severe penalties in accordance with the law.
In August of this year, the city also convened a seminar on legal issues related to the suppression of illegal "one day trip", which examined the means of combining administrative penalties with convictions for criminal offences.
The City Tourism Board said that more regular travel agencies would be encouraged in the future to undertake a "one day trip" in Beijing, and to increase the supply of regular "one day trip" to further squeeze the living space of the illegal "one day trip", and that specific programmes were still under study.
. In addition, the City Tourism Board continuously refines the mission's e-routing information system to ensure that each team is included in the e-routing single platform regulation.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what's the town going through all these years?
As a permanent venue for the World Internet Congress, the way in which U-town took on the summit dividend is a matter of concern.
From the beginning of the first World Internet Congress, the changes in U-town have been visible over the past five years.
In 2014, there were only 12 Internet-related businesses in the town with the digital economy, and by the third quarter of this year there were over 500.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in Utown.
The convening of an Internet conference allowed local businesses to accept the digital economy at zero distance, the inspiration of the digital wave, the strong desire for enterprise transformation and the increased input and research and development of traditional manufacturing enterprises in machine-to-man, intelligent management, and so on.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The development of the digital economy is dependent on the support of infrastructure.
This year, U-town launched a 5G pilot based on the realization of a 4G communications network and free WiFi full coverage.
At the same time, the city of Kyushu, where U-town is located, as the first county-level city in the country to build a special channel for international Internet data, has also become a hot ground for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Congress, the country has introduced 565 digital economy-like projects, with a total planned investment of $37,725 million, and the core manufacturing sector of the digital economy has achieved a gross output of $8.73 billion in the first three quarters of the year, with an increase of 13 per cent over the same period.
"The town of Wu was a tourist symbol, followed by drama and cultural symbols... as a result of the Internet Congress, it has now become an Internet and digital economic symbol. "

At least 410 people have been killed as a result of the tsunami caused by the strong earthquake in Indonesia.
The current earthquake in Central Sulawesi has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified, according to the Director of Public Information of the Jakarta Police of Indonesia on the night of 29th.
A further 29 people are missing and 540 are injured.
The Palu airport is still closed.
Active treatment, with China ' s survival rate of 98 per cent in 29 weeks or more of premature births, has reached the level of developed countries.
The National Centre for Child Medicine (Chen Jing Yan-ting) of China's New Online Sea on 30 September, the University of Jordan-affiliated paediatric hospital, revealed on 30 September that it introduced Canada's advanced methods in the lead China's "China's NICU in-patient pre-natal quality improvement project".
The results of the project show that, after active treatment, China has a survival rate of 98% for 29 weeks and more of premature births, which has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in the early birth of very small premature babies without complications.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese Government has been concerned about the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per 1,000, significantly below the national average, reaching advanced levels in developed countries.
The "China NICU in-patient pre-natal quality improvement project" has significantly improved the quality of survival of pre-natal children through four years of tireless effort.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Newborn Illness Unit (NICU) at the University of Jordan-affiliated Paediatric Hospital, stated to journalists that while improving the survival of premature babies, attention is being paid to reducing the quality of premature child survival, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the overall outcome of childhood illness, which is important for improving the overall quality of life and population quality of pre-natal children, an important issue for the national and international pediatric and neonatal communities, as well as a key concern for the project.
The China NICU Inpatient Prenatal Quality Improvement Project, through four years of tireless effort, recorded tens of thousands of premature births of 33 weeks of age and below throughout the country, which resulted in a 1/3 reduction in the mortality rate of young children of infant age and young birth weight, while the incidence of severe complications in premature births decreased significantly, significantly improving the quality of survival of pre-natal children.
The project aims to improve the integrity, system and effective methods of collaboration for improving the quality of newborns by establishing a nationwide network of collaborations for improving the quality of newborns, introducing the concept of collaborative quality improvement, radiationizing 25 collaborative hospitals across China, establishing a set of collaborative improvements in pre-natal care appropriate to the national context.
The University of Jordan-affiliated pediatric hospital is working with the national Neonatal Unit to develop guidelines for the treatment of newborn infections based on the project ' s accumulated experience and to provide reference and guidance for the normative treatment of newborn infections in China.
It is understood that in the China Prenatal Quality Improvement Project, the Paediatric Hospital introduced the EPIQ approach to 25 large NICUs across the country in 19 provinces, working to address the pre-natal infection that plagues the care of newborns in China.
After more than 10 years of refinement, Canada has increased its national survival rate without complications by about one third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world to expect premature births.
The EPIQ methodology has been applied to all of Canada's NICUs and has been adopted in six countries.
The pediatric hospital revealed that the results of the study showed that, two years after the EPIQ intervention, pre-natal infections had fallen by 35%, while antibiotic use had fallen by 20%.
In the future, the University of Jordan-affiliated paediatric hospital will continue to promote and implement this approach throughout the country, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications of premature childbirth and improving the quality of treatment for newborns throughout the country.
At this time, there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in the various regions of China.
According to Professor Cao, as an important building unit of the National Centre for Childhood Medicine, the paediatric hospital will play a leading radiation role, and this study covers several western provinces such as Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting homogenization and regularization of newborn treatment throughout the country.
It is understood that the University of Jordan-affiliated pediatric hospital is working with the national Neonatal Unit to develop guidelines for the treatment of newborn infections based on the project ' s accumulated experience and to provide reference and guidance for the normative treatment of newborn infections in China.
It was revealed that in 2019, the focal point was located in the Chinese Neonatal Collaboration Network at the University of Jordan-affiliated Paediatric Hospital, which will unite 63 hospitals across the country to undertake the next phase of nationwide quality improvement with a view to promoting the development of an evenly structured level of newborn care in China.
The Shanghai City Director of Health and Peasant said that Shanghai could become a central city in Asia, not only in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system, the quality of services and their results should have a place in Asia, so as to truly reflect China's medical standards.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after Italy's contempt for the demands of the EU and its large-scale budget deficit plan surprises the market, the EU takes a non-confrontive stance against Italy on Friday, but the EU may take a more radical stance if Italy insists on too bold a goal.
The target of the suspected Italian European government is a budget deficit of 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) for the next three years, which suggests that debt reduction is still not available only in the face of demand for reduction.
On Friday, the EU Executive Committee on Economic Affairs, Moscowisi, stated that " we have no interest in the crisis between ExCom and Italy " , and that " since the EU ' s recommendations and sanctions may have little impact on Italy, he has taken a cautious response.
European Union officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy officially submits it to the EU Executive Committee in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level for almost two weeks on Friday, and the Italian bond rate of return reached its highest level for three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the EU Executive Committee may reject Italy's draft budget, something that the Executive Committee has never done to any country.
The Vice-President of the EU Executive Committee, East Blowski, said at a later meeting in Riga, the Latvian capital, on Friday that Italy ' s current fiscal plan " appeared to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Pact " , referring to the financial provisions of the EU.
But he didn't say how this would trigger the EU's reaction.

At the Moo, journalists learned that the membrane-free cotton technology system, featuring "Chinese Cotton 619" and its accompanying planting measures, had initially achieved the goal of membrane-free cultivation in cotton fields, reducing the contamination of the ecological environment and the original cotton by the remnants of the cotton fields in Xinjiang, and that significant progress had been made in the research and demonstration of the membrane-free cotton complex.
The Chief Scientist of the Cotton System of the National Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System, a member of the Chinese Engineering Academy, a prominent cotton genetic breeder, has given the Secretary of the Zhejiang Agricultural University Party Zhou a presentation on the growth of non-film cotton.
" The integrated technology of membrane-free cotton that we have developed can be fully achieved without membrane cultivation and can completely address the challenge of membrane pollution and achieve green cotton planting ... "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing area in China, and in 2017, according to the National Statistical Office, Xinjiang cotton was grown at 35 million acres, accounting for 61% of the country ' s cotton area.
Since the introduction of the membrane into China in 1982, various crops in the Xinjiang region have an area of over 50 million acres, with an annual membrane use of about 300,000 tons.
Among them, the cotton membrane cover reaches 100%, and the cotton field membrane accounts for about 60% of Xinjiang's membrane use.
Imbrane-free cotton is measured and cotton production can fully achieve an acre production of 320 kg to 350 kg.
With the increasing input of the Xinjiang membrane, the low rate of residual membrane recovery, the gradual increase in the number of membranes in the soil and the resulting damage to the soil structure, there are a number of problems that seriously affect sustainable agricultural development.
Imbrane not only causes serious soil contamination, but also has a significant impact on the quality of cotton fibers.
At present, more than one third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang took cotton with an area of about 14 million acres.
. A large amount of surface revenue is generated during the process of harvesting cotton, and the shredded membrane on the cotton strain, mixed with the original cotton, is difficult to remove during the process of processing of the original cotton, and cannot be completely removed during the follow-up process of textile processing, seriously affecting the quality of the textile products.
On 28 September, the national membrane-free cotton spot-watching and research exchange took place in Xinjiang Shaya district.
In order to focus on addressing cotton field membrane pollution, to simplify cotton planting technology and to improve the efficiency of cotton fields, the metaphor is that Trees led his team through eight years to implement "Membrane 619" membrane-free cotton technology cultivation, adding "wings" to the green development of agriculture in Xinjiang.

" ‘Middle cotton 619', under membrane-free cultivation in southern Xinjiang, has achieved a series of accompanying measures such as membrane-free seeding machinery, improved depth of seeding, shallow burial of drips in membrane-free conditions, suitable seed density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation. '
At present, Membrane-free cotton demonstration bases have been established in Aksu, Kulle, Aral, etc. yielding 4,800 kg per hectare.
Imbrane-free cotton cultivation achieves productivity, savings, environmental protection, and improved combined benefits.
Quanjiang Production Corps 3rd Division Agricultural Institute Agriculturalist Zhang Danghai said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of membrane-free cotton cultivation techniques, the production of membrane seed cotton could well achieve an acre production of 320 kg to 350 kg, possibly even higher.
"There are great prospects for the diffusion of membrane-free cotton cultivation technologies ... "

The holiday for National Day Gold Week (1-7 October) is due to begin, and journalists have been informed by the relevant departments that various transport departments such as the Guangdong Railway, Air, Water and Roads are actively planning, increasing the capacity to deliver, putting in place safeguards and doing their utmost to ensure safe and orderly movement of passengers within the country during the Golden Week.
The Chinese Railway Guangzhou Bureau Group Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "the Guang Iron Group") said that during this year ' s National Day Gold Week, the Guang Iron Group was expected to transport 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 1.55,000 over the same year and an increase of 9.2 per cent.
In order to meet the travel needs of passengers, the Guangdong Group plans to open 104 additional high-terrain trains and 85 additional speed trains, mainly on hot lines such as Kyu Guang, Quan, Guangzhou, and Hang Deep High-terrain.
The Guangzhou White Cloud Airport, which will be the busiest airport in the interior during this year's National Day Gold Week, is expected to deliver more than 1.4 million passengers and take off and take off more than 9,200 flights.
With the increasing number of international routes, the airport is expected to be a significant feature of this year's golden week's holiday as compared to the past.
It is understood that Singapore, Bangkok, Puji Island, Jakarta, Colombo, Maldives, and Manila are all on holiday to travel popular cities this year, and that tourist hot spots such as Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur, Bali and others continue to explode, with some flights " hard to get " .
Some airlines have specifically increased their operating classes, such as Shenzhen Airlines, which adds 1 additional Guangzhou-Hanoi daily; Iran Mahan Air, which adds 1 additional Guangzhou-Tehran flight a week on Saturdays; and Vietnam Express, which adds 1 additional Guangzhou-Hanoi flight a week on Tuesdays and 4 additional Guangzhou-Hanoi flights each.
In order to secure holidays, White Cloud Airport has increased its "space allocation " , " baggage security " , "valor service " , "passenger security" and other key job security measures, and has prepared flights for large-scale delays in disposal.
According to China Southern Airlines, this year's National Day Gold Week travels to Austro-China, North America and the Japan-Korean region is very hot, while flights to Mainland China, Chengdu, Qianzhou, Mount Ninehua, Saddle Mountain, and Huangshan are also tight.
The South Plan Gold Week was marked by 50 additional flights, of which 10 were added to the Guangzhou to and from Chiang Mai route.
According to the Guangdong Maritime Authority, a security hazard-checking operation was conducted before the festival against key ships such as the Water Viewer Tour, the Strait of Joan State passenger ferry, the Pearl River Junction high-speed passenger ship, and the ferry to ensure a stable surface traffic safety situation during long vacations.
The traffic in Guangdong Province is expected to be at the top of China's chart during the Golden Week.
The Guangdong Transport Group has recently issued a holiday freeway trip guide, which is expected to grow by about 12 per cent.
The General Directorate of Market Supervision has recently issued a " Circular on strengthening market price regulation during the National Day of the Mid-Autumn 2018 " , which calls for strengthening price regulation in the area of housing rental and real estate, tightening rent-price collusion, hoarding rental sources, fabricating false information and raising rents, charging randomly in the form of binding services, publishing misleading price information, undefined price codes, etc.
The circular made it clear that price monitoring early warning was to be strengthened, with close attention to market price developments.
All places need to pay close attention to changes in the markets and prices of food oil, meat and egg cream, such as salt, and special commodities consumed by local residents on festivals, and to strengthen price monitoring and analysis of early warning.
Once market volatility is detected, the problem of slenderness is identified, and timely measures are taken to address it effectively.
Increased supervision and supervision of distribution and retail outlets of essentials of life, increased monitoring and regulation of places closely related to the daily consumption of the population, such as supermarkets, agro-trade markets, and monitoring of operators ' compliance with the law and good faith.
The circular stated that the focus area inspections should be strengthened to create a good consumption environment for festivals; the regulation of ticket prices in the State-owned scenery areas should be strengthened; priority should be given to checking State-owned attractions for non-compliance with government price levels or floating ranges, the addition of unauthorized billing items, the increase in the price of tickets, high pricing discounts, tied sales, non-compliance with specified codes, non-implementation of preferential measures, price additions, mandatory surcharges, etc.
The notification requirement is to strengthen the regulation of prices of essentials of life, especially agricultural products.
The price of agricultural products essential to life, such as vegetables and pork, has fluctuated in some areas recently, as a result of seasonal changes, natural disasters and outbreaks.
Locally, the market price regulation of agricultural by-products needs to be effectively strengthened in line with local realities, in line with the stabilization of production and market supply in the relevant sectors, and in order to organize efforts to conduct market-focused inspections and random spot checks.
Increased frequency of inspections, serious investigation of offences such as hoarding of wonders, hoisting of prices, collusion in price increases, etc.
The circular states that price regulation in the areas of housing rental and real estate needs to be strengthened.
In mid-Autumn, the National Day coincided with a boom in the sale of housing and goods houses, with close attention to the price behaviour of real estate enterprises, intermediaries and housing rental-related enterprises, severe fixing of rent-price collusion, hoarding of rental sources, fabrication of false information to raise rents, indiscriminate charges in the form of binding services, publication of misleading price information, undefined price codes, and other price violations, increased inspections of prices in the sale of hot-selling buildings and real estate intermediaries, the detection of non-compliance with regulations such as "a set of standards" against consumers, disruption of market order, purification of the real estate market environment, and the creation of an open and transparent real estate market price order.
The circular mentions that local regulation of prices for other segments of the tourism industry is effective, that efforts are being made to regulate the price order for restaurants, accommodation, shopping, sightseeing, recreation, parking, etc., and that operators are directed to make clear price tags, to make charges public, and to seriously check for all types of price violations.
The circular states that the price checks of transport, such as roads, railways, civil aviation, water transport, etc., are to be strengthened, and that illegal increases in prices, extra-price charges, and non-coded prices are seriously checked.
Implementation of a policy of "green passage" for the transportation of living agricultural products and exemption from small passenger vehicle tolls for major holidays.
• Innovative regulatory instruments and methods of work, increased dissemination of price laws and regulations for offline and offline retail businesses and e-commerce platforms, and urged operators to improve price promotion programmes, legally check for false original prices, misleading price indications, non-compliance with price commitments, etc.
The reporter was informed on 1st that the 15th anniversary of the direct passage of the Zhong Hong Kong train, which went through three boosts, had so far seen an increase in passenger traffic; and that the cumulative total number of passengers transporting to and from Zhong Hong Kong had surpassed 1.7 million.
At the same time, Hong Kong Australian passenger clearance is no more than 15 seconds away.
On 1 October 2003, the State Council approved the establishment of the Shanghai to Kowloon Transit Transit Temporary Port, the Shanghai Railway Port being the first passenger port in China to travel to Hong Kong for long-distance railways, marking the opening of Shanghai's ports with water, aviation, and land "three wings flying".
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Shanghai Railroad Border Control, which is responsible for the border control of the entry and exit of the port, revealed that, from the opening to date, the train has been boosted three times, with the travel time being reduced from nearly 30 hours per trip to 19 hours; the annual average passenger traffic from less than 80,000 to more than 150,000 trips per year; and over the past 15 years, the cumulative total number of passengers travelling to and from the port has crossed 1.7 million majors.
It is known that for 15 years, the Shanghai Railroad border checkpoint has signed a police coordination mechanism with the Nine Trains along the route and has sent police officers to conduct on-the-car supervision, achieving full coverage of 1991 km of services and control.
In 15 years, Shanghai Railroad border posts have detected nearly a thousand cases of various violations and have successfully solved cases of foreign nationals entering the country with false permits, leaving the country under the pseudonym of another person's documents, etc.
The station has also established mechanisms such as working exchanges with the Joint Inspection Unit, conducting regular rail crossing integrated counter-terrorism unit surprise drills, joint defensive movements, and building a "third-tier moat" protective belt at the rail crossing.
It is understood that for 15 years, the Shanghai Railway Border Service has been continuously innovative in its services, and the speed of customs clearance has increased significantly.
The border station has also formed the "Zinglan" volunteer service group to provide loving help to the elderly, pregnant women and travelers carrying babies.
On 30 February, journalists learned from the Ministry of Finance that the Ministry of Finance, the General National Tax Administration, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce had recently issued a joint circular to further encourage offshore investors to invest in China, to allocate profits to offshore investors from businesses in China, to use for direct investment in the country without the imposition of an advance income tax policy, and to expand the scope of application of foreign investment incentives to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas.
This policy has been in place since 1 January 2018.
The circular makes it clear that direct investment by offshore investors on the basis of profit-sharing includes the replenishment of offshore investors on the basis of profit-sharing, equity investment behaviour such as new construction, equity acquisition, but does not include additions other than eligible strategic investments, transfers, and acquisitions of shares in listed companies.
If an offshore investor is required to be entitled to a moratorium on the collection of an advance income tax policy but is not actually entitled to it, he or she may apply for reimbursement of the policy within three years of the date of the actual payment of the relevant tax and refund the tax paid.
More than that, investors abroad may continue to benefit from a temporary withholding of income tax policy treatment if the reorganization of an investment enterprise meets the conditions of speciality restructuring and is actually taxed in accordance with speciality restructuring.
In order to ensure that the profits distributed by offshore investors are actually used for direct investments, the notification provides that the profits made by offshore investors for direct investments are paid in cash, that the funds are transferred directly from the account of the profit distribution company to the account of the investor's enterprise or equity transferor, and that no other account is rotated either within or outside the country until the direct investment is made; that the profits made by offshore investors for direct investments are paid in non-cash form, such as in-kind, marketable securities, and that the ownership of the assets in question is transferred directly from the profit distribution business to the investor's or equity transferor, and that no other business, individual, may hold or temporarily held prior to the direct investment.
The circular also requires tax authorities to strengthen follow-up management in accordance with the law.
An offshore investor who is already entitled to a moratorium on the collection of an advance income tax, and who has been certified by the tax administration as not meeting the required conditions, except for the corporate responsibility for profit distribution, is considered to have failed to declare the payment of the enterprise income tax in accordance with the requirements, and will be held legally liable for the delay in tax payment, which is calculated from the date on which the relevant profits are paid.
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Friday that the import of raw materials produced by China's sea medicine industry and the use of preparations made by the company's raw materials would no longer be permitted.

In order to ensure the availability of financing for food policy acquisitions, agricultural distributions have been active in the Autumn grain acquisition of silver companies through visits to a variety of acquisition subjects, such as farmers, processing enterprises, and trading enterprises.
At present, $5.2 billion has been invested in agricultural distribution to support the acquisition of 11.18 billion pounds of autumn food by various food purchasers.
. 120 major food acquisitions have taken place in the Jilin province with nearly 300 acquisition sites, ensuring that the main food-producing county is " fully covered " , leaving no " gap " in the acquisition of funds.
According to the head of the agricultural distribution concerned, in the light of the pace of acquisition and the demand for business funds, and in the event of an inadequate scale of acquisition funds, the agricultural distribution will request an additional $20 billion in credit funds to ensure that the funds are available in full and on time, to preserve the stability of the food market and to protect the interests of farmers.
Chinese journalists will be taken away from the British Conservative Party by the police in the year, and China is asking for an apology.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, a spokesman for the Embassy in the United Kingdom asked questions on 1 January about a Chinese journalist who had been taken by the police during the annual conference of the British Conservative Party.
The speaker noted that we asked the Conservative Human Rights Committee to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, to stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs, and to ask the organizers of the conference to apologize to Chinese journalists.
A journalist asked: during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party on 30 September, the party ' s Human Rights Committee held a side meeting on Hong Kong, inviting the Hong Kong opposition to speak.
A Chinese journalist was taken by the police during the side meeting.
May I ask what your comments are?
In response, he said that for 21 years Hong Kong had returned to its home country, the practice of "one country, two systems" had been a great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements were universally recognized.
Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's affairs are purely internal Chinese affairs.
The Conservative Human Rights Committee used the party ' s annual conference to organize side events to raise awareness of the anti-China separatist forces, and China expressed serious concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We strongly oppose any interference by any organization in Hong Kong's affairs in any way.
Any attempt or action to promote "Hong Kong independence" is futile.
The speaker said that Britain had always marked freedom of expression, but when Chinese journalists had asked questions at the side meeting to express their views, it was totally unacceptable that they had been blocked and even physically violated.
We ask the Conservative Human Rights Committee to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, to stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs, and to ask the organizers of the conference to apologize to Chinese journalists.

This road, which features China, determines that China will not and cannot repeat the fate of the powerful and that China will neither become the United States, challenge it, nor replace it.
In his speech entitled "Opportunities or challenges, partners or rivals", Wang Yi said that the deep-seated crux of the problem currently faced was that some American friends believed that China would also be powerful and would even challenge and replace American leadership in the world.
"This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation ... "

According to foreign sources, on 28 September Sulawesi Island, Indonesia was hit by a powerful tsunami, causing serious damage to several cities along the coast, and the latest news indicates that the number of people killed has increased to 1,200.
The town of Donggala in the city of Palu near the epicenter was reportedly hit by two rounds of tsunami, and the authorities believed that the number of people killed would continue to rise as the relief '72 hours of gold' passed.

"Where can I take a taxi, please?
We want to go to Golden Purple Square to see the flag-raising ceremony of the Fourth of July! "

On the morning of 1 October, in celebration of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a high flag raising ceremony at Kim Purple Square.
According to immigration control statistics, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via Taixi Kowloon Station had surpassed 300,000 as of 30 September.
On the 69th anniversary of the birth of the motherland, the West Kowloon Frontier Station expects that on October 1, there will be a peak of passenger visits to the port on October 2.
The reporter saw the arrival at the lobby at about 7 a.m. on the morning of 1st, and numerous Mainland tourists took advantage of the National Day Gold Week to lift high iron and swim Hong Kong.
Quick Mrs. Song told reporters that the National Day holiday was a rare long vacation of the year, and that it was her long-held wish to see the flag rising at the Golden and Purple Square in Hong Kong that she could achieve that wish on National Day, feeling particularly happy and excited.
But the flight between Ningxia and Hong Kong is not convenient at this time, so it is good to move through the High Iron Hong Kong section, and Mr. Song, after checking the train schedule, finds that the first train could arrive at 7.03 a.m. and access the city's means of transportation to the Golden Purple Square, just in time.
He lamented with reporters: " High iron is so convenient, fast and on time! "
The 70-hour short-distance trains to and from Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Fukuda and West Kowloon greatly facilitated the arrival of residents in the Australasia Bay area.
When Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, arrives, he is preparing to go to Hong Kong's friends who meet at the top of the Central Ring Mountain.
Mr. Liu said, " We intend to challenge ourselves to see if we can finish the 50-kilometre Hong Kong Trail " , both in the Mainland and in Hong Kong on holiday.

The 10-year-old son, Mrs. Yang, who came to Hong Kong with Takatai to compete in the piano, is proud to tell reporters that his son has been studying the piano for three years, and it makes sense to spend the National Day in this way.
She had previously come to Hong Kong on a bus, but it was time-consuming, and she feared that it would affect her son ' s condition. This time, she came by high iron in Shenzhen, made customs easier, halved the time, and the Hong Kong section was more impressed by her journey. She said to reporters, " It's as if I was on the subway, particularly fast, and I didn ' t have time to take a picture! "
On 23 September, at 6:44, the G5711 High Iron Train left Shenzhen North Station, flying all the way, and a few minutes later the train entered the Guangzhou High Steel Hong Kong section, which was the first officially operated high iron train in the Hong Kong section.
Integrating into the country's 25,000-km high-rail network, reaching the high-rail Hong Kong section of 38 long-distance stations across the country, also caters for inland passengers from different provinces in the north of Tiannan.
While visiting his family from Changsha Harbour, Mr. Gao said to reporters that it had previously been possible to sit north of Shenzhen, take the subway over Hong Kong and swagger the city's means of transportation, in exchange for trouble and time, and now sit directly at Kowloon Center, where he can eat his children's lunch and feel very happy.
He said that the " one-place two-check" clearance procedure was more convenient than could have been imagined, " less than 10 minutes, and both levels passed."
The West Kowloon station adjacent to the Airport Express Line, which connects land and air traffic, has also become the preferred destination for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu, who is from Fujian, prepares to spend the Golden Week with her best friends from Hong Kong to the Philippines, pushes her luggage out of the gate at West Kowloon and says to reporters without a scratch: " I was afraid I would not have been able to catch up to the plane, and I didn ' t expect it to be so fast that time was more than enough! "
The new United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, published on Monday, would retain the ability of United States President Trump to implement a 25 per cent tariff threat to imported cars, while at the same time exempting passenger cars, pickups and car parts imported from customs duties from Canada and Mexico.
If Trump imposes the so-called "Chapter 232" tariff on cars for reasons of national security, Mexico and Canada will both have an annual quota of 2.6 million exempt passenger cars exported to the United States.
Under the subsidiary arrangement, the pickups produced in both countries will receive full tariff exemptions.
If Trump raises the car tariff, Mexico will receive a tax exemption quota of $108 billion per year for automobile parts, and Canada will receive a $32.4 billion quota.
both quotas are much higher than the current level of production in both countries, providing room for growth in both countries' exports.

The Mexican President-designate, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, told reporters in Mexico that the United States Government had proposed a new counter-proposal to the Government of Canada and that he would continue to press for the participation of all three countries in the NAFTA.
The Minister of Economy of Mexico, Ildefonso Guajardo, said that the timing of submitting the text of the Anglo-Mexican trade agreement to Mexican and United States legislation had been delayed, as the Governments of Canada and the United States had "very seriously" tried to reach an agreement.
According to Guahardo, " within the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a tripartite agreement or have to publish the text of the two parties ' agreement " .

The spokesman for the United States Office of the Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the US-Ink bilateral trade agreement and on the United States consultation with Canada.
The officials of the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to the request for comment on the counter-recommendation.
According to outside sources, it is difficult to see anything unusual in a conservation centre in the suburb of South Africa's capital, Pretoria, where two small lions play together, although they are virtually nothing.
The University of Pretoria announced: " This is the first young lion ever born by artificial insemination - the first pair in the world. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The director of the Institute of Mammals of the University of Pretoria, Ganswint, said that the two young lions, one female and one male, born on 25 August, were quite healthy and normal.
The breakthrough was finally achieved by his team after 18 months of intensive trials.
When Ganswint was interviewed by the media, he said, " We collect sperm from a healthy lion. "
The next step is to perform artificial insemination for a female lion, such as a researcher, when the hormone content in her body reaches an appropriate level.
According to Ganswint, " Fortunately, the results were successful ... "
. . . . . . . . . . . he said that the researchers " made several attempts, but unexpectedly, did not spend too much effort " .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . he said that the above-mentioned research breakthroughs could be repeated and scientists wanted to use this technology to save the endangered large cat species.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lions have been extinct in 26 countries in Africa, and the total number of surviving wild lions has fallen by 43% over the past 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
The African lions are listed by this organization as vulnerable animals.
And Ganswint said, " If we don't do something for this animal, they'll face extinction. "

South Korea's exports fell the largest in over two years in September, but analysts blamed the downturn for fewer days of work and stated that global demand for South Korea's commodities remained strong despite the rise in trade tensions between China and the United States.
It is true that South Korea increased exports on average last month.
In addition, the earlier published initial figures show a double-digit increase in exports in the first weeks of September before a long vacation.
the largest decline since July 2016 in South Korea's exports in September compared to the previous year, which was greater than the 5.7% decline estimated by 11 analysts from the Reuters survey.
The opening value released on Monday showed exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
Despite concerns that the growing trade dispute between the United States and China could cause other export-dependent Chinese neighbours to suffer, South Korea increased its exports to China by 7.8 per cent in September, expanding for the twenty-third consecutive month.
South Korea's exports to the United States fell by 11.8 per cent, owing to a decline in the sale of petroleum products.
The overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products have increased by 28.3 per cent and 13.5 per cent, respectively, although the market is worried that the so-called "supercycle" of chips may have peaked.
" However, the impact of trade conflicts will be difficult to avoid, as South Korean exports rely heavily on the United States and Chinese markets ... "
• Imports declined by 2.1 per cent to $40.8 billion, or 3.1 per cent, as predicted by the Reuters survey.
The trade surplus began at $9.7 billion in September, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that, thanks to the United States and the EU countries, the global manufacturing industry would remain booming, which was a positive factor for South Korean exports.
The statement states that " higher export prices caused by rising oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year ... "
" But the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, combined with increased market volatility following the rise in interest rates in the United States, is a negative pressure on exports. "
The average export during the working day in September increased to $2.6 billion, compared with $2.1 billion in August.
The South Korean mid-Autumn Festival fell on September 24-26, so in September there were only 19.5 working days, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea exports grew 4.7% in January-September compared to the same period last year.
According to the Japanese/Market Purchase Manager Index, South Korean manufacturing activity rebounded in September, but was backed up by domestic orders, as orders from China and Japan fell, which threatened to cloud the prospects of another export.
The North Korean press criticized the United States for not relaxing sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea.
The North Korean Labour News published a signed review article on September 30, criticizing the United States for not relaxing sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea while seeking dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, calling it a "controversial" practice.
According to the article, United States Secretary of State Pompeo "4th said "The key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the implementation of sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea " , stressing that the position of the United States to continue to comply with United Nations sanctions resolutions remains unchanged.
In the joint Singapore-United States statement, the two sides committed themselves to establishing a new inter-Korean relationship commensurate with the aspirations of the two peoples of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States for peace and prosperity.
The United States, on the one hand, has increased the pressure on sanctions and, on the other hand, has called for dialogue, an approach that is undoubtedly contradictory.
The article says that, if a new inter-Korean relationship is to be established, a permanently consolidated peace regime is to be built on the Korean peninsula, and the Korean peninsula will be completely denuclearized, trust should be built first, starting with what can be done, one by one, in a phased manner.
The article also states that the United States should understand that sanctions are not working for North Korea.
The article said that even the "North Devansk" before the Kazan had made the U.S. troops hymn.
" We'll meet strong potential rivals. It's enough to look at the ‘North Devinsk' submarine."
The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the "North Devonsk" submarine.
He said, " The submarine is impressive... looking at the development of the Russian Navy and how resources are used will tell that its main efforts in research and development are, first and foremost, to strengthen the submarine fleet " .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Fogo said, " I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages ... "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Kazan, New Siberia, Krasnoyarsk, and the Alhangelsk multi-purpose submarines are "white wax tree-M" improvements, with 13,800 tons of drainage, 520 metres down depth, 64 people, 31 knots underwater, and will carry torpedoes, torpedoes and "caliber" and "Manau" cruise missiles.
On September 29, the Newkyo News (Nei Wei), the General Directorate of Radio and Television, issued a " Circular on the development of a special overhaul of radio and television advertising " , which has been in operation since that date and at the end of the year.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to the circular, the focus of this special overhaul is on nine aspects of the search and overhaul.
Among them are: advertisements with orientation problems; advertisements with low content, tone and low grade; advertisements with excessive amounts of excess time that do not play as required; advertisements with medical, pharmaceutical, medical equipment, health-care food, cosmetics, beauty, etc., that cause excessive false publicity, misleading audiences, or release in the form of a programme, etc.; medical feeding programmes with unrecorded management problems; advertisements with exaggerated false publicity, misleading audiences, with expected returns on investment, such as recruiting unions, investment finance, collections, etc.; advertisements that induce minors to behave badly or form bad values, undermining the physical and mental health of minors; advertisements with public service advertisements that are broadcast long and often unrequited; advertisements with poor airing systems, which examine the lack of enforcement of customs and responsibilities; and advertisements with other illegal violations.

The circular requires that the various types of illegal advertising found in the supervision and inspection by the radio and television administrations at all levels be dealt with strictly in accordance with the General Directorate's "Procession of Infringements by Radio and Television Broadcasters".
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In recent years, the General Directorate of Radio has repeatedly called for the suspension of illegal advertising.
This year, the National Radio and Television Authority issued a notice calling publicly for the suspension of serious irregularities such as "0 Bubble Fruit Milk" "Sawa Cocktail" "Bonret Plants Against Episodes" and other advertisements that led to bias and exaggerated propaganda to mislead audiences.
The General Authority for Radio and Television has developed a number of regulations and circulars to regulate the broadcasting of advertisements on radio and television.
The Circular on Further Strengthening the Management of Television Shopping Advertisements for the Broadcast of Veteran Video Channels stipulates that TV Shopping Short Advertisements shall not be broadcast on each Veterans Video Channels for a period of between 18 and 24 o'clock a day.
In other times, short television shopping advertisements may not be broadcast using a host for propaganda purposes, or "seller" for voice, tone, action, etc., or "orthopaedic", "plastic", "perform" or disguised promotions such as "slubber" or "slubber" for breast enrichment, weight loss products, no more than one (sub) short television shopping advertisement per hour per day and no more than three minutes per item.

The circular also stipulates that broadcast agencies on radio and television must strictly examine the qualifications, certifications and other statutory materials of health information advertising, such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, health-care foods, and firmly prohibit the broadcasting of sex-related advertisements.
In order to regulate the form of health information advertising, advertisements may not be published disguised in the form of health information feature programmes.
The health information feature programme should focus on scientific knowledge of disease prevention, control and treatment, should not contain advertisements such as promotional medicine, medicines, medical devices, health-care foods, and should not be proven in the name of patients and doctors, pharmacists, experts, etc.
Manturov said, " For the first time, we have adjusted the format of the MAKS International Aerospace Salon.... We propose China as the main guest country ... Chinese colleagues have agreed and accepted our invitation ... "
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the Fourth Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Putin.
This is his first time at the forum.
Ignoring U.S. threats!
EU or will enter into a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran
The U.S. government recently declared that a new round of sanctions against Iran would be relaunched in November, and even urged other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
However, the allies of the United States do not seem to have heard it.
According to the United States New York Times, on 29 February, when Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif was interviewed, it was revealed that Tehran was close to an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite threats by the United States to sanction any country doing business with Iran.
The core purpose of this agreement is to attempt to create a new payment mechanism, i.e. to replace dollar transactions by bartering or local currency pricing.
The purpose of the methodology is to hope to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the promotion of the agreement, some French and British officials are concerned that, if the agreement were to be achieved, it would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . during an hour of interviews, Zarif's words sound more optimistic than they have been in recent months.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
" This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit from it " , Zarif argues that States have the legitimate right to trade with Iran under the agreement reached in 2015.
The head of European Union foreign policy, Federica Moguerini, also said today that " no sovereign State or organization can accept anyone else to decide who it can trade with ... "
However, she also predicted that, prior to the next sanctions by the U.S. government in November, United States leaders might adopt a range of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and the State with which they had commercial dealings with Tehran.
In May of this year, the United States Government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed and stated that the agreement could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The U.S. side then threatened to ban companies that purchased Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat led to the evacuation of some companies from Tehran and the collapse of Iranian currency.
Businesses such as Airbus and the French oil giant Dodal have cancelled billions of dollars of investment in Iraq.
. British and French officials have said that the United States government may "take the upper hand."
The result is that, according to a recent Turkish media report, the United States sanctions do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iran's oil minister, Zangane, has recently revealed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
both Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that the purpose of the American side's series of actions is to "sedit" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also indifferent to a series of verbal attacks on the American side, and when asked if the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, " it was a regime change strategy, and that was the true purpose of the American side. "

The large single-body art device public service show on both sides of the river, Princess Rabbit, was held during the Fourth of July in the Articular Landscape and focused on creating an "eyeball effect", attracting a large number of visitors, citizens to visit the scene, photographing, forwarding the circle of friends, filming the shivering, and adding a "net red" factor to Xiamen's city.

In order to further encourage offshore investors to invest in China, four ministries, including the Ministry of Finance of China, jointly advised that, as of 1 January 2018, profits distributed to offshore investors from resident enterprises in China for direct investment in the country had been extended to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas for which income tax policy had been suspended.
The Ministry of Finance website contains notices that foreign investors will not collect advance income taxes at the same time meet a number of conditions, including direct investment by offshore investors on a profit-sharing basis, including the replenishment of foreign investors on a profit-sharing basis, equity investment acts such as new construction, equity acquisition, but not new additions, transfers, and acquisition of shares of listed companies (except for eligible strategic investments).
It also includes dividends, dividends and other equity investment returns from the actual distribution of realized retained earnings to investors by resident enterprises in China.

The journalists learned from the National Board of Health that the incidence of malnutrition among our children and adolescents had declined and that the incidence of overweight obesity had increased significantly compared to several decades ago.
In this regard, experts noted that the most important idea of maintaining healthy weight is to " treat undisease " and to promote scientific fitness and a reasonable diet.
The key to maintaining healthy weight, according to the " Core Information and Interpretation of Adolescent Health Education in China (2018 ed.) " recently released by the National Health and Safety Commission, is reasonable dietary and scientific campaigns.
. Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not good for health.
The health risks behind the Little Fatties can't be ignored.
The Director of the China Centers for Disease Prevention and Control's Nutrition and Health, Ting Gang, said that overweight obesity endangers the normal growth and development of adolescents, negatively affecting their psychology, behavior, cognitive and intellectual development, and can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high blood resin in children.
At the same time, youth overweight can continue into adulthood and will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and other diseases in adolescents as adults.
According to Ting Gang, the 2010-2012 nutritional and health testing of Chinese residents showed that our 6-17-year-olds had an overweight rate of 9.6 per cent and a obese rate of 6.4 per cent, adding up to 16 per cent.
At the same time, overweight obesity among children and young people presents a higher ratio of boys than girls, a higher profile in urban than rural areas, and a significant increase in overweight obesity rates in recent decades.
How do adolescents cope with overweight obesity?
Zhang Zhang, Deputy Director of the Research Centre for Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion of the National Directorate of Sports, noted that the main causes of current youth obesity are excessive heat intake and insufficient physical activity.
. For this simple obesity, emphasis should be placed on the scientific movement with reasonable dietary control.
Zhang points out that the most important idea of maintaining healthy weight is to " treat undisease " , an important part of which is to provide all-round science education to schools, parents and students, to spread awareness of the dangers of overweight and obesity, and to raise awareness of adolescent prevention.
Young people should undergo regular medical examinations to monitor growth and development indicators, such as height weight, and find out early on whether there are problems of overweight and obesity in science to allow for timely interventions.
In the case of adolescents who are already overweight, Ting Steel advises that, in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and sports, adolescents are in a special physiological stage and should avoid the use of hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce weight, and should not be blindly given weight loss medication.

On such a special day, members of various sectors of society, such as the families of Zheng's anti-war veterans, representatives of the PNG Party, and representatives of Hunan's House of Veterans, came to the " Tong Mansion Gardens Against War Theme Garden " in Changsha City to attend the 2018 Martyrs Memorial Day Zhao's collective burial ceremony for other 10 anti-war veterans and four anti-war veterans' companions.
"The anti-war veterans are the witnesses of the Chinese resistance, the true, vivid and distinct teaching materials of patriotism."
The former Vice-President of the Hunan Provincial Political Association, Liu Xiao, said that the anti-war veterans had been brave and had forgotten my patriotism for the contemporary nation was a valuable spiritual asset.
In his message, the Vice-President of the Changsha Municipal Council, the Chief Executive Committee of the Zhu Jian army, noted that, in recent years, the Care Against War Veterans project has become an excellent brand in the social service of Changsha citizens through living allowances, free old-age pensions, and free burials.
He believes that only by engraving history in his heart can the spirit of resistance be inherited.
At 11 a.m., in a solemn and heavy music sound, the people who came to the event stood up.

The new revised Air Movement Protocol (hereinafter referred to as the Dispatch Protocol) for the Water Hub at the Three Gorge Dam was officially implemented on 1 October, and the Three Gorge Lifters were formally integrated with the locks two years after the pilot voyage.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the waters of the Three Gorges-Gate Dam were in good order.
The Yangtze Three Gorges Navigation Authority issued its first security plan on 30 September at 2100 hours and conducted security checks on 160 ships, with a total of 124 vessels cleared.
On 1 October, at 1400 hours, the navigator department arranged for the first pass plan after the new regulations were implemented.
Following the implementation of the new regulations, the security screening plan was released once a day at 0900 hours and again at 2100 hours, and the crossing plan was released at 1400 hours and 2000 hours, respectively, to allow ships to arrange the crossing plan flexibly.
The Dispatch Protocol added the principle of "classification control" of ship past dam dispatch, specifying the prioritization of dam ship according to the gate and the functional positioning of the lifter, and adjusting the short-line passenger ship passing the gate to the same priority level as the model ship and the good faith ship.
It's also two weeks after the lift was tested, officially unified with the locks.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the same time, the Movement Control Protocol adapts "routing dispatch management waters" from the previous 180 km close dam waters to 541.8 km from the Yunyang Yangjiang Bridge to the Shige Chief Jiang Bridge, and divides "core waters, near dam waters, controlled waters, and dispatch waters " .
This has facilitated the choice of suitable waters for locking and reduced the backlog of dam areas for locking ships.
The Dispatch Protocol also provides for the cancellation of declarations of non-conforming ships and 24-hour delays in the crossing of dams, based on the current ship-over dam, pending characteristics.
After the storage of the Three Gorges, the condition of navigation in the reservoir area was improved, contributing to the rapid development of Yangtze shipping.
The data show that the annual cargo traffic through the three canyon gates and the Guzhou dam gates increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons, respectively, in 2017.
The three canyon lifters tested for navigation over a period of two years through 5767 ships, 16.22 million passengers and 1.71.28 million tons of freight.
The Deputy Director of the Three Gorges Transit Authority, Chen Dongwon, stated that the Dispatching Protocol had a positive effect on promoting good-faith gate management, maintaining traffic order at the two dam hubs, defusing ship-to-lock pressure in the dam area, and enhancing navigation capabilities.

On the approval of Prime Minister Li Keqiang, the State Council issued a "Decision on the regulation of licences for the production of industrial products and on the simplification of approval procedures " .
The Decision proposes that the management of industrial product production licences be further suppressed, that the 14 categories of industrial product production licences be eliminated, and that the regulatory authority for the production of 4 categories of industrial products be delegated to the Provincial People's Government's Quality Technology Supervision Department.
Following this reform, the implementation of industrial product production licence management products will be reduced from 38 last year's pressure to the current 24 categories.
The "decision" is clear, with a simplified approval process for the products in the catalogue.
The first is to change the pre-licensed product test by the issuing agency to a product test qualification report issued by a qualified testing and testing agency at the time of application by the enterprise.
The second is that, in addition to hazardous chemicals, the technical supervision department of the provincial people's government for quality (market supervision) applies back-to-back on-site reviews of licensed products, and enterprises submit applications and product testing qualified reports and make commitments to ensure product quality security, obtain a production licence after formal clearance and then undergo on-site review within a specified time frame.
The third is the production of different categories of products in the business catalogue by enterprises, which review the issuance of a licence together with a new application for a licence or an application for a change of licence, in accordance with the "One Enterprise One Certificate" principle.
The "decision" requires that the regions, the relevant departments, firmly advance the work on the decompression catalogue and the simplified approval process.
Increased corporate commitment to publicity and back-up on-site review, enhanced credit monitoring and restraint tools, implementation of corporate responsibility for quality subjects, suspension of production licences for false commitments, non-compliance with requirements.
In the case of products that are subject to the elimination of licences for the production of industrial products, there is a real need to strengthen ex post regulation, involving public health and safety, environmental protection, etc., which can be transformed into mandatory certification, positive lists and social publicity, harmonization of certification standards, reasonable reduction and certification of testing projects, and mandatory certification costs are in principle borne by all levels of finance in an institutional manner.
• Take support measures to encourage voluntary certification by enterprises, promote branding and expand markets.
Quality improvement in industrial products is to be promoted against standard international advanced standards.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For products that retain industrial product production licences, the standard system should be improved, industry regulatory advantages should be exploited, "who approves, who regulates" responsibilities strengthened, product quality safety risks should be assessed dynamically, catalogues should be suppressed, approval powers should be delegated or converted to certification management.
China's combined PMI ring ratio was upgraded in September and the manufacturing PMI ring ratio fell back.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on 30 September, China ' s integrated PMI output index was 54.1 per cent, higher than the average of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points in the previous month and year, indicating that Chinese enterprise production activities remained generally stable.
That month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which make up the integrated PMI output index, were 53.0 per cent and 54.9 per cent, respectively, with a decrease of one liter from the ring.
Of these, the Chinese manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, and the ring fell 0.5 percentage points back.
According to Zhao Qinghe, there are five main features of this month ' s manufacturing PMI:
The first is that manufacturing basics are generally stable.
Among the 21 industries surveyed, PMIs in 14 industries are located in expansion zones, where manufacturing PMIs such as medicine, specialized equipment, electrical and mechanical equipment are located at higher operating levels above 53.5 per cent, increasing faster.
The second is small fluctuations in supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0 per cent and 52.0 per cent, which were 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points lower than last month, respectively, and supply and demand continued to maintain a state of view, but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and the import index were 48.0 per cent and 48.5 per cent, which were below 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points last month, respectively, and the viewing level fell to a low point in the year.
The fourth is the increased cost of acquiring raw materials from enterprises.
The main raw material purchase price index was 59.8 per cent, an increase of 1.1 percentage points over the previous month, and the out-of-plant price index was 54.3 per cent, the same as the previous month, all of which were high points in the year.
The fifth is the robust operation of large enterprises and the continuing improvement of small-scale enterprise operations.
The large enterprises PMI of 52.1 per cent, which is the same as the previous month, have been in the expansion zone of 52.0 per cent and above since this year, and the production index and the new order index ring increase this month are the main drivers of the expansion of manufacturing; the medium-sized enterprises PMI of 48.7 per cent, which is below 1.7 percentage points last month and is located in the contraction zone; and the small enterprises PMI of 50.4 per cent, which is 0.4 percentage points higher than last month and rises for two months.
That month, China ' s non-manufacturing business activity index stood at 54.9 per cent, an increase of 0.7 percentage points over the previous month and a two-month recovery.

He said that if financial institutions were to be more active in taking on risks to compensate for the effects of years of low interest rates that had led to a narrowing of profit margins, the banking system could be destabilized once a serious negative shock had occurred.
" Although these risks are not significant at this time, the central bank will follow the situation closely and encourage the financial institutions to take the necessary measures " , he said.
The minutes of the Central Bank of Japan meeting, published earlier on Monday, show that at the September conference, the Central Bank of Japan Policy Committee discussed the rising costs of long-term easing policies.
The minutes of the meeting show that one member said that if the economy continues to expand, " the Central Bank of Japan will have more room for policy flexibility in the future ... "
The minutes of the meeting showed another member that, given its limitations during the duration of the policy, the Committee should discuss how long the Japanese Central Bank could maintain the stimulus policy.
. Kuroda Dongyan said that the Central Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks posed by easing policies, while also considering the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic prospects, which could affect global demand as a result of trade frictions and growing protectionism in China and the United States.
The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being," said Dongyan Kuroda.
" But how the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy may be greater," he added.
" There is a need for a strong monetary easing policy on a continuous basis, while considering both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner," said Toshiya Kuroda.
While the ills of radical stimulus schemes have increased, such as long-term low interest rates that erode the profits of financial institutions, the inflation downturn has forced the Central Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Central Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the war dispute over global trade, Dongyan Kuroda ruled out the possibility of rising interest rates in the near future.

Under a settlement agreement, the United States Tesla Automobile and its executive director, Mask, had agreed to pay a $20 million fine each to financial regulators, and Mask would resign as chairman of the company, but still serve as CEO.
The settlement agreement will put an end to Tesla's two-month-long turmoil.
The securities fraud charges and settlement agreement disclosed on Saturday by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission will be a relief for investors.
The investors had feared that the protracted legal struggle would only further hit this still-deficit electric car company.
The SEC sued Mask for fraud on Thursday, alleging that its 7 August tweet misled investors.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . he was considering privatizing Tes
The SEC claims that these tweets are practically unfounded and that the market turmoil they trigger has damaged investors.
According to investors and corporate governance experts, the agreement may strengthen Tesla, who has been devastated by Mask's recent actions.
. Steven Heim, the head of Boston Common asset management, said that the settlement agreement should have put Mask under more supervision, without taking the "destructive" measure to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds the Panasonic stock of Tesla's battery manufacturer.
According to this proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop regulation of Mask's external communication.
" It is in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, that this matter be resolved quickly on the terms agreed upon " , said SEC Chairman Clayton in a statement.
The Thursday allegations resulted in the evaporation of Tesla's market value of approximately $7 billion, and the company's market value was $45.2 billion on Friday, down from $47.5 billion for General Motors.
The SEC retracted the request to remove Mask from the company's head of the company in a settlement agreement.
Many investors have said that the penalty would be disastrous.
"I think this is the best possible result for all concerned," said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a "neutral" rating, and said that the SEC penalty was "a light penalty" for Mask.
"It's important for Tesla that he remain CEO. "
Neither Mask nor Tesla acknowledged or denied SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement, and did not immediately respond to the request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be ratified by the court.

On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that China's opening doors would not close, but would only open larger, and that the steps that pushed for higher levels of openness would not stop.
The expansion of imports is not an equity measure, it is a long-term future-oriented consideration, and it is expected that China's imports of goods and services will exceed $30 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively, over the next 15 years.
In his keynote speech at the first China International Import Fair, Xi will further reduce tariffs, accelerate new business developments such as cross-border electric operators, continue to liberalize market access, promote the opening of services, provide education with large domestic market gaps, and ease foreign capital stock-to-trade restrictions in such areas as health.
China will protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors.
He said that China would press on with the proposal for a phased construction of free trade port policies and systems in Hainan, accelerating the process of exploring the construction of China's niche free trade port; the addition of new areas in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone; and the establishment of a new science board and pilot registration system at Shanghai Sea Certificate Exchange to support the development of regional integration in the Yangtze Delta and to increase it to a national strategy.
"The Chinese economy is a sea, not a small pond.
When the wind is flat, and when there is a storm, " Xi closes to say, " The storm can lift a small pond, but not the sea.
After countless storms, the sea is still there!
After more than 5,000 years of hardship, China is still there!
For the future, China will always be here! "
He noted that economic globalization was at a turning point, that multilateralism and free trade regimes had been struck, that uncertainties remained high and that risk challenges had increased; that open cooperation was an important engine for enhanced international economic and trade cooperation, and that countries should adhere to openness, expand mutually beneficial development space and enhance macroeconomic coordination.
He stressed once again that the opening of the doors in China would not be closed, but would only be larger and the paces that pushed for a higher level of openness would not stop.
China will stimulate import potential, respond to domestic consumer escalation, take more active and effective measures to promote income growth among the population and foster higher- and middle-end consumer growth points.
China will respect international business practices and treat all types of enterprises registered in China equally.
China will protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors, firmly punish violations of the legitimate rights and interests of foreign firms, especially intellectual property rights, improve the quality and efficiency of intellectual property reviews, introduce a punitive compensation system, and significantly increase the cost of violations.
Turning to China's economic prospects, Xi said that the main indicators of economic growth, employment, prices, balance of payments, enterprise profits, fiscal revenues, labour productivity, etc., were in a reasonable zone and provided an important basis for achieving the year-round goal.
In comparison to other major economies, China continues to have the highest economic growth in the world.
" The fundamentals of healthy stability in China ' s economic development have not changed, the conditions of production factors underpinning high-quality development have not changed, and the overall momentum towards long-term stability has not changed " .
According to Xi, there is a good deal of optimism about China's economic development prospects.

"Believes that as long as the strategic momentum is maintained, reform and openness are fully deepened, and the lower atmosphere is able to resolve the outstanding contradictions and problems, the Chinese economy must be able to accelerate its transition to a high-quality development trajectory." Xi said.

Indonesia's strong earthquake and tsunami deaths have risen to 420, and there have been no reported casualties among Chinese citizens.
The number published by Wilem Rampanilei, the head of the national anti-disaster agency, was quoted by the official Indonesian Antara news agency at midnight on 29 local time, and the number of deaths from the strong earthquake and tsunami in Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, has risen to 420.
According to the official, this is only statistics from the city of Palu, capital of the Central Sulawesi province, excluding the area of Dungara County and nearby Sigi in the epicenter, as communication between the two areas is still disrupted and no reports of the number of people killed have been received.
Since many roads in the city of Palu have been severely damaged, heavy machinery is difficult to access, and search and rescue efforts have encountered great difficulties.

The Secretary-General of Xi gave a very important speech at the Private Enterprise Symposium, inculcating firm confidence in the private economy's move towards a wider stage.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. Market dynamism comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, and from entrepreneurship.
In the 40-year-old boom of reform and opening up, there are thousands of stories of entrepreneurial innovation, and the entrepreneurial community has grown and continues to push the Chinese economy forward.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The false claims of the so-called "private economy off-the-shelf theory" "new public-private theory" have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
In recent times, some private enterprises have encountered a number of difficulties and problems in operating development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export firms; rapid restructuring of demand has brought about pressure for transformation and upgrading; some policies are inconsistent with each other, policy effects overlap with each other, or simple ways of working, resulting in the opposite effect of some policies originally intended to be good, etc.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In this context, it is particularly relevant to correct perceived misperceptions, remove the burden of the entrepreneur's mind, allow the enterprise to develop with one mind, and the Government to promote development with one heart, which is of particular relevance to market confidence and development expectations.
The seminar once again highlighted the important assertion that "three are unchanged": "The place and role of the non-public economy in the economic and social development of our country has not changed!"
In recent years, the party's central focus on entrepreneurs has been unprecedented, and institutional safeguards have been unprecedented, from furthering decentralization, establishing a system of power lists to creating a rule of law environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a fair and competitive market environment and creating an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs throughout society.
The symposium, in particular, made clear policy initiatives that strongly supported private enterprise development in six areas and launched a series of practical actions dedicated to private enterprise "lightly moving forward".
These have greatly encouraged the group of entrepreneurs and have increased expectations from all sectors of society.
The mist is lifted, the approach is set, and the key is implementation.
It is important to constantly create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises to solve development difficulties and help to upgrade the Chinese economy; it is necessary to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legitimate operations, feel respect in social life, stimulate innovation and create potential.
The Chinese economy entered the process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to develop their ambitions and providing greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to develop their creativity.
We have reason to believe that, as reforms deepen further and obstacles are broken, the private economy will usher in better prospects and opportunities for development towards a wider stage.
Network verification of 46 internal Mongolian import/export chains - China New Network
On November 5, China's new internet calls and Hot's November 5 (journalist Lee Aiping) Hue and Hue Customs reported that, from that date, all 46 local import and export chain regulatory certificates were networked, with the exception of special circumstances such as confidentiality requirements.
Inner Mongolian enterprises can declare relevant documents to customs by paperless means, avoiding problems such as past live run, paper applications, and duplicate submissions.
It is understood that the time of preparation of documents refers to the time of preparation of the various types of documents required for the import and export chain prior to the declaration of customs is a major factor affecting the overall clearance time, and that to compress the time of clearance and reduce the cost of customs clearance, the document must be reduced.
The number of regulatory documents previously required for customs clearance at the import and export chain was 86, involving 19 departments.
It is known that this time, based on the principle of "can cancel, merge, exit check for exit" and exit check, based on the International Trade "Single Window" platform, customs and 16 other licensing agency systems are connected and data are interconnected, resulting in multiple runs of data and fewer runs for businesses.
For customs, it was stated that in the past businesses had had to return to and from the department's on-site hall to submit paper applications, which were lengthy and did not allow for real-time follow-up of the status of the review.
Now business users can access the "Single Window" portal directly and apply online.
After the issuer's review, transmit the certificate's electronic data to customs and achieve automatic comparison with customs clearance data at the clearance point, intelligent verification, and unified audit results to enterprises through "single window" feedback, achieving regulatory document declaration, audit, clearance and full-process online processing of feedback.
Han Zhuang soup has increased his exports to China by 20 times in four years or is associated with an increase in the number of young people living in empty nests - China's new network
Han Zhuang soup to China has increased 20 times in four years.
The Korean Federation reported on 5th that last year South Korean chicken soup exports to China exceeded $100,000, a sharp increase of about 20 times over 2013 four years ago.
The analysis concluded that this increase was related to the increase in youth in the air nest in China, which led to the promotion of food-friendly heat sales, and to the increased interest of young people in nutritional feeding.
The data was published by the Korean Agricultural Aquatic Food Circulation Community (AT) on the 5th day.
The South Korean chicken soup exports to China last year amounted to $10.339 million, weighing 21.859 million kilograms, a sharp increase of 2094 per cent and 3668.8 per cent, respectively, over 2013.
The analysis concluded that the increase in Korean chicken soup sales in China was related to the increase in youth in empty nests, which led to thermal marketing of convenient foods, and to the increased interest of young people in nutritious meals.
As of this year, one-person households in China have crossed the 200 million mark and are expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020, and local food businesses are also targeting the solos to launch various convenient foods.
In addition, the analysis also indicated that avian flu was the largest factor hindering the mainland Chinese market for brood soup.
According to aT, there was an avian flu outbreak in South Korea from November 2016 to April last year, and a general ban on chicken soup exports to China led to a sharp decline in exports.
The chicken soup exports to China amounted to $840,000 in 2016, and exports fell sharply to $100,000 last year as a result of avian flu.

National Day is celebrated by a flag raising ceremony at the mouth of the border crossing between China and China.
" Unexpected to have such a magnificent flag-raising ceremony on the frontier, it is more shocking than watching the flag-raising in the interior. "
In the morning, Mr. Zhang, who had come from Sichuan to visit the Yunnan River Junction Junction of the border with China, along with more than 500 troops, residents, and tourists from China and the outside, watched the flag-raising ceremony at the State Gate to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the establishment of the People ' s Republic of China.
The mouth of the river is the largest of the Yunnan section of the border between China and China, located in the mouth county of the Red River State, Yunnan Province, and is located along the river with the Old Street City of Vietnam, which is a country-like port.
As the nation was built "across the way", as one of the easiest routes for China to connect to South-East Asia, the flow of entry and exit traffic at the mouth of the river grew steadily.
At 7.30 a.m. on the morning of that day, the sun had just shed a corner, and the restricted area at the mouth of the river had early assembled local people at the mouth and tourists from the centre and out of the river who had come to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 0745 hours, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the State Ceremony at the river border checkpoint shuddered and carried a healthy pace to escort the flag towards the flag-raising platform.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after the conductor gave the order to raise the flag, the flag-raising hand struggled to draw out an arc, and the bright five-star red flag suffled as the "hawk wings" generally swung its flag, accompanied by the national anthem of the national anthe majere. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
" A flag-raising ceremony on the occasion of each major national day, spring, national holiday, etc., not only presents the image of China, but also inspires the love of the country among the people of the frontier ... "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It is known that the National Gate Service, which is responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the mouth of the river, consists of more than 40 troops and officers from various posts at the river border checkpoint, from a three-man flag-raising team to a large-scale ceremonial unit, which has been in existence for more than 60 years and has been carrying out more than 70 missions of foreign affairs ceremonials at the national level since its formation.
The newly revised Personal Income Tax Act adjusts the criteria for the determination of Chinese personal income tax residents from one full year to 183 days.
The Minister of Finance of China, the relevant head of the National Tax Administration, stated on 30 February that, in order to maintain policy stability, consideration would be given to the continuation of preferential arrangements for persons outside China, including Hong Kong Australians, as the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that the regulations in force for the implementation of the Personal Income Tax Act provide for special advantages in the area of taxation of persons abroad, and that individuals who do not have a residence in China but who have resided for more than one year or more than five years may pay personal income tax only in respect of the portion paid by units in China or individuals.
The portion paid outside the country is not subject to personal income tax in China.
The Ministry of Finance of China, the National Tax Administration, the National Commission for Reformation and the Ministry of Commerce also issued a circular to extend the scope of application of the policy of withholding advance income tax from foreign investors for direct investment in the distribution of profits.
The distribution of profits to offshore investors from resident enterprises in China for direct investment in the country for the time being without the imposition of an advance income tax policy has been extended to all projects and areas that are not prohibited from foreign investment by foreign investment incentives.
During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive messages on the Korean peninsula.
The President of the Republic of Korea, Wen, in Cai, conveyed his "irreversible" nuclear abandonment determination and stated that United States President Trump and North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un might meet before the end of the year.
The U.S. Department of State subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to facilitate the implementation of the U.S.-Korean leader Singapore's meeting commitment.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has broken through Chongbing to open the path of dialogue, and the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States have met, and the general trend towards easing the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the issue of the peninsula has been upheld.
In the first place, the point that "the essence of the issue of the peninsula is security" has not changed, and that the key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to be good, to be balanced in addressing the legitimate security concerns of the good parties, rather than to exert pressure on each other and to emphasize their own claims.
Secondly, in the dialogue towards the denuclearization of the peninsula, differences persist between the parties on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, and the gaming thinking "Who first and later" remains strong due to the chronic lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States.
At the Security Council ' s public meeting on the Korean peninsula, held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea once again highlighted the " unchanging " of these two points on the peninsula.
United States Secretary of State Pompeo insisted that the sanctions against North Korea would not be lifted until the Korean peninsula was completely denuclearized.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Lavrov, for his part, emphasized the principle of "action in response", noting that " the weakening trend of sanctions should be the same as the steps taken by North Korea on the path to the progressive abandonment of nuclear weapons " .
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Council's resolutions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but that pressure is not an end in itself, and that the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are all demands of the Council's resolutions, and that the two must not be sidelined and cannot be chosen alone.
As Wang Yi, Secretary of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, said, in view of the current positive developments in Korean, Korean and American relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider initiating reversible provisions in due course, thereby encouraging the DPRK and the parties concerned to take further steps towards denuclearization.
Recalling the past, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process require sufficient political courage on the part of the parties.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote a political solution to the peninsula, it is particularly important for the parties concerned to show political energy, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve difficult problems, continue to move forward in parallel with the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and the establishment of a mechanism for peace on the peninsula, in order to create a permanent peace on the peninsula.

Health centres and health stations provide influenza vaccination services, especially during the National Day holidays.
The Department of Health ordered 150,000 doses of the 2018-2019 4-valent influenza vaccine this year, giving priority at this stage to free vaccinations for high-risk persons, and providing vaccinations at health centres and health stations under the Department of Health, especially on National Day holidays (1 and 2 October) from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. to 1 p.m., in order to facilitate the vaccination of residents during holidays.
In addition to the above-mentioned civilian measures, health centres and health stations under the Department of Health have, since the launch of the plan, been extended to 8 p.m. on Mondays to Fridays, and as of 4 p.m. on 30 September, 4,158 people have been vaccinated, more than 3,714 in the same period as last year.
The following MSAR residents are covered by free vaccinations: 6 months to 18 years of age, 50 years of age and older, pregnant women, all chronically ill persons, including obese persons (i.e. BMI with a body quality index of 30 or more), as well as homes, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools, staff of secondary schools, all health workers, and Macao residents working in gambling playgrounds.
At the same time, other persons deemed necessary for vaccinations by the Department of Health, including in the public sector, will actively contact the relevant agencies to obtain a list of such vaccinations, which will be arranged by the health centre.
In order to facilitate vaccination time for the inoculators and the reduction of the waiting time for rotation, the Department of Health will send medical personnel to its secondary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries between October and December this year to provide group vaccinations against influenza for young children, young and middle school students, teachers and employees; in addition, the Department of Health will also arrange for mass vaccinations for the elderly and disabled homes, with a larger number of public sector or other institutions.
If students and young children fail to participate in group vaccinations, they can be vaccinated from 3 December 2018 at a Macao resident's identity card, a health office user's card, a flu vaccination card (if any), a student's certificate, an employee's certificate or a vocational certificate at a general hospital or a health centre.
The Department of Health reminded residents that during the period from September 2017 to August 2018, people who had been vaccinated against influenza from 2017 to 2018 were still in need of a new season of influenza vaccine from September 2018, as the influenza antigens contained in the 2018-2019 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine had been updated, targeting the northern hemisphere winter 2018-2019 and the seasonal influenza of the summer of 2019.
The peak period of flu in Macao generally occurs in January-March of each year, later than in temperate regions (such as northern China and Japan), and the Health Authority calls on those at higher risk of complications following flu infection, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and chronic patients, and those who are in constant contact with them, to be vaccinated as soon as possible.

On the evening of 29, journalists were informed by the Communications Department of the Cheng Metropolitan Qing Baijiang District Council that, on the evening of 29 September Beijing time, a row of Central European Banes (Shengdu), carrying goods such as car connectors, telescopes, liquid crystal screens, etc., had been replaced, turned over and finally arrived in Nuremberg, Germany.
This was the first time that central Europe had opened the Polish Shemianufka crossing line in the country, marking the successful opening of another European transport line in Central Europe after Mara, Jopp.
This Central European class, which was launched on 14 September by Chengdu Ching Baijiang Station, left the country through the Aramaic Pass to enter Europe via the Polish port of Shemianufka, eventually reaching Nuremberg, Germany, for a total of about 16 days.
For the first time, the Central European class trip was the replacement of the line wide track and landmark track here.
The opening of this port effectively addressed the long-term operation and length of time caused by the current congestion at the Mara junction, raising the time limit for Banley transport; and providing a new solution to the problem of congestion at Mara junction, further improving the delivery capacity and transport efficiency of the western Chinese interior to the Euro-Mediterranean market, laying a solid foundation for the opening of central Europe's Banes to the European market.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, took place on Friday, and more than 400 people have now confirmed their deaths, many of whom were swept away by tsunami waves triggered by the earthquake.
The authorities expect that as new data are reported in remote areas, the total number of deaths on Sunday will increase significantly.

The earthquake triggered a wave of up to six metres (20 ft) that struck the city of Baru.
So far, only deaths from Baru have been reported, the death toll in Dangla, north of Baru, is slow, and authorities are preparing for a worse situation.
The population of Dungula is 300,000, which is closer to the epicenter of this earthquake.

. Reuters Tokyo 1 October - The short-sighted survey quarterly published on Monday by the Central Bank of Japan showed that the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in the September season touched the lowest level in more than a year due to rising costs of raw materials and a series of natural disasters affecting production, putting pressure on businesses.
The survey has hardly shown that escalating global trade friction strikes the confidence of large manufacturing people.
The risk of a full-scale trade war, however, strikes the business prospects of enterprises and may threaten corporate capital spending.
An active capital expenditure is a highlight in the Japanese economy.
The survey raises questions about the Japan Central Bank's view that robust economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to reach the 2 per cent target, although there are indications that businesses are gradually transferring costs to their customers.
In a climate of concern caused by the global trade war, the confidence of the manufacturing community is stagnating due to a slowdown in exports and weak factory production," said Nan Wuzhi, the chief researcher of the Golden General Institute in Agroforestry.
"confidence remains high... and I don't think confidence will continue to decline because business profits are improving and prices are rising."
The short-sighted survey shows that the September large manufacturing landscape judgement index declined from positive 21 to positive 19, three months ago, for the third consecutive season.
The market has a median estimate of positive 22.
The large non-manufacturing landscape judgement index in September dropped from positive 24 to positive 22 in the June survey, and deteriorated for the first time in eight quarters.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The survey showed that both the large manufacturing and non-manufacturing weather judgement indices were expected to remain stable in December.
The investors did not care about the drop in the short-sighted Enterprise Scenic Judgment Index, and the Japanese stock market index.N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday and helped improve the export profitability prospects of Japanese enterprises as a result of the continued devaluation of the yen.
The capital expenditure is robust.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest short view highlights the robustness of corporate capital spending plans, the benefits of upgrading production capacity and the increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with the labour shortage caused by population ageing.
The Central Bank's short-looking survey shows that capital spending for the current fiscal year by large enterprises, which is scheduled to end in March 2019, increased by 13.4%.
The previous short-view survey was 13.6 %.
South Wuji said that all corporate capital spending plans for the fiscal year grew by 8.5 per cent, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble economy.
He stated that " given that small enterprises are increasing their profit projections from now on, there is room for further growth in capital spending, but this depends largely on the impact of trade wars on business confidence " .
The short-sighted survey showing the increased capacity of enterprises to transfer costs, with a positive 7 per cent output price index for large enterprises, is an encouraging sign that Japan has made progress in its efforts to counter deflation.
The index for measuring employment in large enterprises touches negative 23, the most compact level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
The second season of Japan's economy rebounded from the contraction in January-March of this year, benefiting from strong corporate spending.

Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany - China New Network
The 69th International Astronautical Congress opened on October 1 at the Bremen Exhibition Centre in Germany on October 1 at Bremen, Xinhua, Germany, with the attendance of more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and businesses, expert scholars and young students from around the world.
The President of the International Astronautical Federation, Jean-Iv Legal, addressed the opening session, saying that the global space industry was no longer a small number of countries and institutions involved, and that the number of participants had increased significantly this year from the previous session, indicating that an increasing number of institutions and people were joining it.
He called for greater cooperation and innovation among States to advance the development of space.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Information Technology of China, Director General of the National Space Agency, Zhang Kwun, presented China's space programme and stated that China would expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to the cause of human space.
The participation of relevant agencies such as China Aerospace Science and Technology Group, China Aerospace Technology Group, and representatives of a number of private enterprises showed the latest achievements in Chinese space, including various types of launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress, which has been held annually since 1950, is the largest gathering in the world's aviation community.
The Congress, which was held for five days, was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Center for Applied Science and Technology and Microgravity Studies of the University of Bremen, the International Institute of Space Law and others.

However, considering the constant rise in the cost of composite elements, such as domestic raw materials, labour, and the increased external environment of the impact of friction in trade between China and the United States, participating firms consider the export situation to be less than optimistic next year.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Guangzhou Conference, Xu Jun, Deputy Secretary-General, Press Speaker and Deputy Director of China's Foreign Trade Centre, said that the number of overseas buyers and exports at this meeting had fallen by the same token.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The export was sold in the amount of RMB 2,064,944 million (equivalent to $29,860 million), a decrease of 1% over the same period.
From the market point of view, for Japan, the ASEAN 10, the " Brick Four " and South Korea, respectively, the trades grew by 74.4 per cent, 11.4 per cent, 7.2 per cent, 2.5 per cent, and for traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union, by 30.3 per cent, 8.9 per cent, 7.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively.
In industry, transport tools, mechanical equipment, construction and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, and bathing equipment increased by 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent, and 7.6 per cent, while textile clothing and domestic appliances decreased by 13.0 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively.
According to Xu, as a barometer and wind mark of China's foreign trade, the current wide-ranging procurement attendance and export-transaction data indicate that China's foreign trade development is still facing a number of uncertainties and uncertainties next year.
However, as supply-side structural reforms advance further and policy measures such as the recent "Six-Six-Six-Six" are being introduced at the national and local levels, China's new dynamic of foreign trade development is accelerating its build-up, and new advances in the diversification of enterprise markets are important foundations and strong conditions for foreign trade development.

The Chinese Customs Administration has announced that exports increased by 14.5 per cent in United States dollars in September, imports increased by 14.3 per cent in September, the trade surplus in September was $31,690 million, and the export growth and trade surplus in September were the highest since February of this year.
Despite the escalation of trade friction between China and the United States, China's export performance in September was significantly higher than expected, with strong foreign demand, and the degree of resilience of China's foreign trade as demonstrated by the fact that firms had taken over exports and the exchange rate of the yuan before tariffs were raised in the United States, or by major supporting factors, but the impact of trade wars between China and the United States on confidence and the impact on the industrial chain could not be underestimated, and analysts believed that the challenges of China's foreign trade could appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
The Reuters survey shows that the manager of the United States Fund recommended an increase in cash holdings in September, maintaining a cautious stance, as the United States and China began the latest round of reciprocal import tariffs, and the dispute showed no signs of easing.
However, according to the 12 fund managers involved in the survey, North America ' s asset allocation rose to its highest level since June 2017, while the United Kingdom, the euro zone, and especially emerging markets, were held back.
The global stock allocation averaged 56.6 per cent and the bond share 35.5 per cent, largely in line with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
One of the fund managers of a large fund company said that " some economic data bring confidence to the market, but trade wars remain the greatest concern, so it is best to be prepared to enter when markets fall back ... "

Today, the Open Landmarks of China in Shanghai, the world's first major national-level exhibition on the subject of imports — the China International Import Fair — officially opened in the hopes of the crowd.
A show is like a "window" that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through this "window" of the Expo, people see a move towards a higher level of "opening China"; with this "window" of the Expo, the world is welcome to win with the "reform opening up again" of China for mutual benefit.
" For a country, openness is like an open cocoon, which will experience a moment of pain, but will be replaced by freshmen. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Recalling the 40 years of reform and opening up to China, which dared to enter the vast ocean of the world market, despite vortex and wind waves, it has always faced all the risk challenges in an open posture, unleashing in-house momentum and increasing competitiveness.
It can be said that China has strongly interpreted the value and significance of openness with its own solid achievements.
At the beginning of a new history, the holding of an import-themed fair, a major decision by the party centered around Comrade Xi, aimed at advancing a new high level of external openness, was a major Chinese initiative to open markets to the world, a real Chinese initiative in favour of economic globalization and trade liberalization, demonstrating the strong and clear will that "China's open doors will not be closed, but will only grow wider."
The large number of candidates from all countries, "one hard to ask " , is the greatest positive and best response to China ' s development of an open economy on a wider scale and in a broader field.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
The rise of trade protectionism in some countries and the return to the old path of unilateralism have increased the international community's concern about the prospects for free trade and have added much uncertainty to the world economy as it warms up.
In the context of such an era, this gala in Huang Pujiang embodies China's defence of free trade, allowing the world to see the opening of markets and the sharing of future Chinese confidence and China's role.
Solo, solo, solo, solo.
China ' s open heart and embrace of the world has not only contributed strongly to its own development, but has also given rise to "China ' s opportunities " for countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, China has promoted and promoted the construction of a " all the way " , initiated the creation of an Asian Investment Bank and set up a silk road fund ... China has provided a series of international public goods, offering real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allowing enterprises to take China ' s " express ride " for development.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On this platform, more than 3,000 businesses in more than 130 countries and regions have made a new step in the Chinese market with their distinctive quality products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, there are domestic consumers who really benefit from it.
By setting up this platform of "optimistic excellence", it provides a multi-channel supply of good quality to upgrade consumption to meet the individualized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs of the masses of the population.
As the doors open in China open, the goods flow, and the goods do their best, the steps towards a better life will be stronger.
From a more macro point of view, the significance of the Exposition has gone beyond economics and trade to the future, to convey the ideas of openness, inclusion, inclusiveness, balance, and win-winness and to forge a common understanding of the common response to today's challenges.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, and the world is better.
We look forward to the success and beauty of the world at the Exposition; we look forward to the future of a brighter future for a higher level of "open China" working with the world to build a community of human destiny.
c) Foreign media: USC has agreed on a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The [summary] agreement includes the opening by Canada of its dairy market to the United States, and the suspension by the United States of tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
According to outside sources, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of 30 September local time that the United States and Canada had reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was revealed that the agreement included the opening by Canada of its dairy market to the United States, and the suspension by the United States of tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
On 27 last month, the United States and Mexico announced an initial agreement in principle to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the 31 August deadline set by the United States to extend the negotiations until September 30.
Previously, a spokesperson for Canada ' s Foreign Minister, Friland, said that Canada would only sign a favourable agreement, " focusing on substance rather than on a timetable ... we will continue our consultations in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in Canada ' s national interest " .
More than 90% of Brazilian female voters said that the presidential candidate did not take women's needs into account.
According to the South American Diaspora Network, data published recently by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) indicate that more than 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not believe that presidential candidates consider the needs of women.
The report states that the number of women in Brazil has now reached 107 million, and that if all Brazilian women were brought together to form a country, the country would have a population of 13th in the world, twice as many as the Spanish population.
In Brazil, the number of female voters is 52% of the total number of voters and 48% of the total number of voters are men, and although the proportion of women in the electorate is very high, in the Brazilian Congress only 10% are women.
The participation of Brazilian women in politics is only 154th out of 193 countries worldwide, higher than in the Arab States.
After more than 20 years of rights struggle, Brazilian women still do not succeed in acquiring the rights they deserve.
According to Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, this phenomenon exists as a result of the confluence of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
" Politics should have been national claims of citizenship, identity, access to public goods and the formation of a single society by multiple social groups ... But Brazil ' s politics belong to a monopoly of one group, and the majority of the population is not represented ... "
A previous study conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Motor Vehicles (Locomotiva) also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that elected politicians were able to represent their rights, 90 per cent of Brazilian women did not agree with the decisions taken by politicians, and 93 per cent did not agree with the governance policies of the current government.
"We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in Parliament, and Brazil ' s political system remains affected by inequality.... So far, there is still a serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the Brazilian political sphere." said Natalia Mori.
Although women's rights are inadequate, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 per cent of women believed that they could make a difference in democratic elections, and 72 per cent were interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women less prejudiced.

The full staff of the Embassy of China in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese enterprises, Chinese expatriates, Confucius College and student retention representatives attended the event.
On 1 October, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-lifting ceremony in anticipation of the birth of a 69-year-old in New China.
Following the flag-raising ceremony, the Chinese Ambassador to Ha Zhang Zhang said that, on the 69th birthday of the great motherland, we held a flag-raising ceremony in the exotic countryside, a profound patriotic educational activity.

Zhang Zhang said that the Chinese nation is closer today than ever to the great goal of achieving national renaissance and closer than ever to the center of the world stage.
"Our mission, responsibilities and work are more glorious, arduous and onerous than ever before... "
Zhang stressed that, in keeping in mind the mission, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) should be able to build the "one way" and move further, drawing a more beautiful "one way" and " one way " to devote all its power to the development of the motherland and to the friendly cooperation of the Chinese Communist Party.
The T2 terminal of Guangxi Guilin International Airport was officially opened on 30 October.
The CCP Guilin City Secretary Zhao Lu Qin stated that the new terminal was able to meet 12 million passenger throughput needs each year after its launch and that the new advantages of air traffic in Guilin were significant for further refining the Guangxi River connection, sea and iron connections, land and water access, and the airport connection to the "four-one" modern stereo traffic pattern.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . this year is expected to be over 90 million visitors.
The expansion of the T2 terminal and the platform facility at Guilin International Airport is a major public good project on the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Magnificent Autonomous Region and a landmark project for the construction of the Guilin International Tour destination.
The project started in December 2015, with 100,000 square metres of construction and a total investment of RMB 3258 million, which, when built, will meet the needs of 12 million passengers per year, 10.12 million take-off and drop-off, and 95,000 tons of mail.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal of the Guilin International Airport.
The design of the new terminal was inspired by the fact that Mount Guilin has a "mountain crown", which resembles the "long-ridge terrace" and the stacked roofs of the north of Guilin Mountain, and is luminous with the water of Mount Guilin.
The new terminal at Guilin Airport was described as meeting the peak traffic of nearly 4,000 arrivals and departures per hour, applying smart baggage sorting systems, security integration platforms, human face recognition, etc. "smart airports" techniques, and planning a wide range of business-like areas covering catering, department stores, tax exemptions and recreational entertainment.

But since the current growth in the United States is benefiting from the time of the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the country's economy is also receiving close attention from the outside world.
" As the United States is returning to full employment, the economic downturn is inevitable... "
The only question, he said, was when it would happen, and in his opinion, it might only be possible not to push back in advance.
Despite Barclay's optimism about the economic prospects of the United States by the end of this year, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to make predictions of a longer time.
" In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth, current fiscal policy-enabled growth will be difficult to sustain " , said Barclay Economist in a study.
" At a time of lack of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing of the economy in 2020 will rise " , they said.
A series of business surveys will show roughly that major economies are at the stage of the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and U.S. manufacturing surveys, due to be released next Monday, will be followed, and services surveys will be published on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data section will inevitably be on non-agricultural employment in the United States, which will be released next Friday, and which will provide a clue as to whether the tight employment market is driving a significant increase in wages.
It is important not only because it is important to the profitability of the enterprise and the purchasing power of the consumer, but also because pay jumps or triggers overall inflation rises may upset officials of the United States Federal Reserve Commission (the Federal Reserve/FED).

[Summary] Once completed, the ship will be delivered to the East Sea Branch of the National Ocean Administration of China, and Chen Zhui, Chief of the Observation Service of the Marine Early Warning Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship would be of great importance for the development of China's offshore ocean observing system and the promotion of global ocean observations.
On 29 September, China's first 3,000-ton-class large buoy ship "to Yanghong 22" was laid down by the Chinese martial vessel group.
When built, the ship will break the current Chinese equipment bottleneck in safeguards such as large buoys, sub-platforms, recycling, and salvage.
The Sun-Red 22 wheel is used primarily for the regular inspection maintenance of buoys/submarines, regular placement, recycling, buoys/submarine emergency clothing, recycling, and recovery, recovery and recovery, along with the ability to carry out integrated marine investigation missions such as fault surveys.
The new vessel is 89 metres long, 18 metres wide, 7.2 metres deep and continues at 10,000 nautical miles.
The Deputy General Manager of the Wuhuang Group, Wang Mei-gi, said: " The fact that the 22 ships to Yanghong are our first large buoy operating vessel and the country ' s only working vessel with the capacity to lift up 10 metres of large buoys will further enhance our capacity to secure large buoys. "
It is understood that the ship, once completed, will be delivered to the East Sea Branch of the National Ocean Administration of China, and the Chief of the Observation Service of the Marine Early Warning Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China has stated that the ship will be of great importance for the development of China's offshore ocean observing system and for the promotion of global ocean observations.
"The ship, which has both large buoy placement maintenance operations and an integrated marine investigation capability, is the first comprehensive ship in our country to be dedicated to the operations of the Mid-Range Sea buoys and the integrated marine survey.
With such buoys operating vessels, our future ocean observations and investigations will have a strong leeway ... "

Influenced by Typhoon Tung-mi, strong winds continued in the harbour, with a maximum wind speed of up to 24 knots, the launch signal was delayed for nearly 90 minutes from 1 p.m., and the wind rate remained low, and the general referee for the event, Anne Mdrant, announced the cancellation of the first day's race, delaying the race until the afternoon of 1 October.
"The strong winds from the shore continue, and the sea is so intense."

Despite the worldwide financial market shocks, the Hong Kong Financial Authority stated on Monday that the foreign exchange fund's investment revenue for the third season of this year was reduced significantly by 97 per cent annually, but better than it had been in the previous season, as the overseas stock boomed under the Chinese-American trade battle, and the foreign exchange losses were significantly narrowed.
In July-September 2018, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment revenue of HK$1.6 billion, significantly lower than the HK$61.8 billion recorded in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million recorded in the second quarter of this year.
In the Legislative Assembly, the Managing Director, Chen Deok-hoon, stated that the Hong Kong and emerging market stock index at the beginning of the Central American trade war ran counter to the US stock index until the end of September, when the US stock market index peaked at the beginning of October, when market sentiment began to reverse, as investors became aware that the trade war was also detrimental to the United States itself.
" A change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if trade warfare has only unilateral effects, it will not help in solving things ... "
At the same time, however, he noted that " financial market volatility would continue to rise if the trade war between China and the United States was not resolved " .
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund's stock investment losses in Hong Kong were between HK$8 and HK$4.7 billion narrower than in the previous season, while the foreign exchange losses were between HK$172 and HK$12.8 billion; the foreign exchange losses were between HK$16.2 billion and the bond gains of HK$9.7 billion, which decreased by 24 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively, mainly reflecting the general rise in the dollar's principal currency exchange during the season and the 3-cent increase in the rate of interest in the United States in mid-September.
The foreign exchange funds are mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
The Hong Kong dollar-linked exchange rate system has been in place since 1983.
In response to Hong Kong's current financial situation, Chen Deok-chul claimed that economic and asset markets were becoming more uncertain and risked down, but that Hong Kong's financial system was robust and well defended against the earthquake.
" Hong Kong has an ample international investment position, with a net external asset of $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, 2.5 times more than Singapore and 0.6 times more than Japan, to cope with the down-cycle or reversal of the economy. "
The recent retrenchment of the Hong Kong dollar and the widening of the United States dollar spread, Chen Deok-won noted that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate had risen by more than 400 base points on 21 September and that the market was generally considered to be related to the rise in the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, which then hovered at a level near 7.80-7.84, and by the time of the recent retrenchment of the Hong Kong dollar, the spread of interest with the United States dollar might attract the market to the Hong Kong dollar and increase the arbitrage activity for the purchase of the dollar, leaving the chance that the Hong Kong dollar could trigger a weaker exchange guarantee once more than in the previous period.
. But he believes that as the Hong Kong dollar interest rate is normalized as the Hong Kong dollar interest rate begins, the future Hong Kong dollar interest rate is below the dollar rate will change.
" The Hong Kong dollar interest rate will be more consistent with the United States dollar, and you must be more careful to manage risks and be prepared to cope with market fluctuations. "
As the Hong Kong dollar is well-funded, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate falls further, falling from 0.9 to 2.08179 per cent on Mondays for three months, and the difference with the United States dollar is increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month rate is five months lower, and the difference with the United States dollar is expanded from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
During this period, the flow of funds from the collections following the completion of the large draw event, among other factors, led to a weak exchange guarantee being triggered several times in May and August, following the first trigger in April.
The FDA bought the Hong Kong dollar at 7.85 levels under the linkage exchange rate system and gave it the United States dollar in order to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
The Authority bought about HK$52.1 billion under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism in May and August.
Is the new tax code also favourable to people outside the country?
In response to a question from a reporter on 30 March, the relevant head of the Treasury, the Directorate of Tax Administration, said that, in order to maintain policy stability, consideration would be given to the continuation of preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong, Australia, in the next implementation of the new personal income tax law.
Questioned by journalists, the newly revised Personal Income Tax Act adjusted the country's Personal Income Tax Resident Taxpayer's criteria from one full year to 183 days.
Would there be any preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong Australians, when the Act is next implemented?
In response, the Officer-in-Charge stated that the current regulations for the implementation of the Personal Income Tax Act provide for a special preferential provision for the taxation of persons abroad, and that individuals who do not have a residence in China but live for a period of more than one year and less than five years may be paid a personal income tax only in respect of a portion of the income received outside China and paid by units within China or by individuals.
The head said that, in order to maintain policy stability, consideration would be given to continuing preferential arrangements for people outside the country, including Hong Kong Australians, in the next implementation of the new Personal Income Tax Act.
No "threshold" crescent centre: Quality certification prompts higher quality.
With the pull of the "two-child economy", the boom of the mother and child market, from the northwards to the three-and-four-line cities, a variety of lunar societies have emerged around the world.

The National Directorate of Market Supervision recently launched the 2018 national "Quality Month" series, with journalists coming to a five-star crescent centre in Tianjin City to visit the mother and child care service certification experience.
The general crescent centre provides services such as neonatal care, nutritional feeding, post-natal plastic repair, etc.
In this crescent centre, journalists see that nurses check their newborns daily for breastfeeding, and professional carers provide the newborns with sophisticated care services such as bathing, touching and so on.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, care such as care for the initial wound of the Moon, to the later aesthetic care of the Moon, and the provision of care such as treatment of beauty in Chinese medicine, helped mothers to recover their postures.
A new mother in the house told reporters that she was not scheduled to attend the club until eight months earlier.
The service lines of the Tsukiko Institute have a direct impact on the comfort and physical recovery of the mother during her life, and some small crescent homes can only provide some simple crescent services, with the risk of disinfective hygiene, susceptibility to cross-infections, and a single unscientific diet.
The head of this crescent centre said that they were the only five-star crescent centre in Tianjin City to have a B-level service certification.

The Deputy Director-General of the Accreditation Regulatory Department of the National Directorate of Market Supervision, Pan Liven, said that service certification was based on customer perception, a new certification system that focused on organizational quality management and service quality satisfaction, and was an important component of the national quality infrastructure, which had a positive impact on increasing the share of quality service supply and enhancing the international competitiveness of Chinese services.
From 2004 onwards, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has gone through a process of non-existent and progressive development, with the emergence of a number of influential certifications of services such as certification of financial services, certification of maternal and infant care services, certification of post-sale services, certification of e-commerce services, certification of health services, etc.
According to the National Directorate of Market Supervision, there are currently more than 130 service certification agencies in the country, more than 2,000 service certification officers, and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.

The Chen Deok-ho also pointed out that if the building price were to be reversed, the first to be affected would be those who would be in business during the height of the city, but that the expected collapse of the building, such as in the 1997 Asian financial storm, would result in a much lower chance for citizens to cut their prices to sell the property.
When Chen Dehjoon led several senior members of the Gold Authority to the Legislative Council briefing, he said that if the city was confirmed to be in a falling cycle, the relaxation measures could be continued in due course.
"But now only a few weeks of data, relaxing is still too early to say, and it still takes a little more time to see if the city is going into the next cycle."
Since October 2009, the Authority has so far introduced eight rounds of countercyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages in various industries, including lowering mortgages, and mortgage applicants are required to pass rigorous stress tests to enhance bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest-rate cycle, the price index for private residential buildings in August-September in Hong Kong fell at a peak for two months in a row, and the monthly fall in September increased to 1.44%.
The cumulative increase in the first three seasons of the year, however, still stands at 10.2%.
The financial position of households that measure Hong Kong ' s vulnerability to financial risks remains healthy, according to the Gold Authority, with 66 per cent of households living in their own homes without mortgages in the second quarter of this year, up from the average of 60 per cent in 2009-11; the average number of new mortgages released and the ratio of contributions to interest earned on new mortgages is 47 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively, a marked improvement from 64 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, in 2009-11.

The Vice President of the Authority, Nguyen Guoxin, however, noted that the authorities estimated that the total amount of mortgages provided by developers was high, accounting for only 2-2.5 per cent of the total bank mortgages, and that the proportion remained low.
At the peak of Hong Kong's negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, representing 22% of the population providing the building.
And as of the third season of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets in seven consecutive seasons.
A further wave of tax negatives, involving value added taxes, excise tax exemptions, etc., came on October 1, when Xinhua Beijing's power supply (Lihongxia, Mawei) retail export firm for e-commerce.
The Ministry of Finance, the General State Tax Administration, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Customs Administration have recently issued a joint communication clarifying the export of goods that do not obtain a valid import certificate to the electronics-exporting enterprises in the integrated testing area of cross-border e-commerce, as well as piloting the value-added tax and consumer tax tax tax tax exemption policy, if the following conditions are met.
First, e-commerce exporting enterprises are registered in the Composite Test Zone and the export date, name of goods, unit of measure, quantity, unit price, amount are registered on the Integrated Services Platform on the cross-border e-commerce line of the registered place.
The second is that export goods are subject to electronic commerce export declarations through the customs authorities of the place where the Zone is located.
Thirdly, the export of goods is not a product of the Ministry of Finance and the Directorate-General of Taxes that is expressly cancelled (exempted) by decision of the State Council.
The circular makes it clear that the General Customs Administration regularly transmits electronic information from the e-commerce export declaration list to the National Tax Administration.
The tax authorities in each of the test zones have strengthened their tax-free management of export goods on the basis of electronic information from the list of export goods declared by the National Directorate of Taxes.
The circular states that specific tax-exempt management practices are developed by provincial tax administrations, commercial departments, and commercial departments.
The offices of the leadership groups and business authorities in the building of the complex areas should work together to advance inter-departmental communication and related policy implementation, accelerate the establishment of a statistical monitoring system for e-commerce exports, and promote the healthy development of cross-border e-commerce.

On 1 October, the first day of the Golden Week and the final day of the Hong Kong National Day public holiday, many Mainland residents used their vacations to travel abroad, shopping, and many deep-seated Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong on that day, and there were new 22 self-help channels opened at Shenzhen ports, Lake Roo, Shenzhen Bay Junction, to improve customs efficiency and facilitate efficient and rapid customs clearance for passengers.
According to data from the Shenzhen border station, as of 16 p.m. on that day, the number of people entering and leaving Shenzhen port amounted to more than 429,000, the number of transport vehicles reached more than 168,000 (boats, racks, columns), and the ports remained busy and undisturbed, maintaining a good order of entry and exit.
It is understood that, as a result of a number of beneficial factors, including the increase in the number of countries offering exit visa waivers to Chinese citizens, the number of travellers travelling on vacations to countries such as Europe and South-East Asia on the National Day holiday has continued to increase.
On the morning of the first day, passenger (car) flows peaked in the direction of departures from the ports of Lake Rowe, Shenzhen Bay, the Emperor and Fukuda, where the peak of passenger (car) flows at Lake Rowe was sustained from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and the peak of passenger (car) flows at Shenzhen Bay was from 6:30 a.m. to 13 noon.
It was explained that, in response to the peak flow of incoming and outgoing passengers (cars), the Shenzhen Border Control Station, in accordance with the National Immigration Administration, had integrated its deployment, activated the passenger/car rush hour service model, arranged for overtime police to support the line of duty, opened an early check-up route, guided passengers, and orderly waiting for vehicles to ensure that Chinese citizens had no more than 30 minutes to line up for entry/exit clearance, taking into account the efficiency of foreign customs clearance; and strengthened the maintenance of order in high-flow areas to ensure that customs clearance was safe and orderly.
At the same time, Shenzhen Border Station reminds passengers to travel to and from the country, before leaving, of the documents and visas, the period of validity of the sign, the reasonable organization of the journey, the avoidance of peak passenger hours as far as possible, the selection of the right time and the right port.
A passenger travelling to Hong Kong on the Guangzhou Tai Railway is required to have a valid entry and exit document and visa sign, a ticket is only a car ticket, and cannot be used as an entry and exit document, such as for reasons such as non-conformity, to travel to Hong Kong, following the guidelines of the Border Guard Police, waiting at a designated location for the staff of the Hong Kong Rail Company to take the ride back to the Mainland.

In recent days, a joint team of researchers at the University of Qinghua School of Life Sciences, Liu Wanry, and the Director of the Rheumatoid Immunology Centre of the Beijing University People's Hospital, has discovered the presence of molecular variations that increase the susceptibility of systemic red-scathedral lupus, and the involvement of this variation in the regulation of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systemic red-scathedral lupus.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaozheng, the Chestnut Nation team collected and conducted research on nearly 2,000 cases of large samples of systemic red-blank lupus, and found that the incidence and severity of inflammation such as immunoglobin variation had increased significantly in patients with a wide range of pathogenic cells and types, with a large number of their own antibodies, kidneyitis, arthritis, mammothitis, and vascular inflammation.
The Liu Wanri team, through a variety of research methods, such as immunocellular trace, animal testing, and sequencing, found that this immunomolecular mutation-activated immuno-signal pathway promotes mechanisms for B cells to secrete multiple of their own antibodies.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Liu Wanri team is committed to Blymphocytes immunological recognition, immunoactive research, and the Chestnut Nation team is engaged in long-term clinical research on systemic red-blank lupus.
" This study is one of the results of years of collaboration between the two teams and is the first time that academia has been institutionally aware that immunoglobin genetic abnormalities will induce systemic red-blank lupus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeting for treatment. "
It's not short. It's legal.
A lawyer with an axe in court?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it blew up the pan in the legal circle.
The law in the city of Fujian Springs subsequently fined the lawyers involved $500 and recommended in writing that the Quanzhou City Bar Association investigate and deal with it.
According to the New Kyoto newspaper, the former Quanzhou City Council issued an official circular stating that the lawyer's actions did not involve violations of the law and were not punishable under the law.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete truth reduction: the axes carried by the counsel in question were the same type as the murder weapon of the accused, the same type, but did not open the door, merely to provide supporting evidence at the testimonial, and there was no subjective intent to intimidate the move or "threat to the safety of the court."
There are four very important details for determining whether the actions of the lawyers involved were unlawful: first, the local court held two previous sessions, presenting only an axe photograph, which was necessary from a defence point of view; second, the axe was purchased one hour before the hearing, and not the lawyer's unwillingness to seek the judge's consent, but was objectively unable to reach the judge; third, the entire axe was not excessively or improperly used; and fourth, the lawyer involved made a public error at the first time and apologized to the court.
The combination of these circumstances shows that the lawyer in question "takes an axe in court" is not guilty, but only for the defence.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And this decision, too, is subject to the test of fact and law.
As for bringing to court, without the court's permission, as an axe for a control knife, it is indeed easy to cause disquiet and misunderstanding.
For security and due diligence, the previous fines and judicial advice of the Quanzhou Central Court were also indiscretion.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from using them, the Supreme Law issued in 2014 the People ' s Court Judicial Police Security Check Rules, which establish the principle that a physical examination is not required for lawyers to appear in court.
Since the rule was issued, lawyers at large have led by example, and there have been few incidents where the security of the court has been compromised by security clearance loopholes.
In very few cases like Spring State, misunderstandings are not difficult to eliminate as long as they are communicated in a spirit of mutual respect, understanding and respect.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulatory organization of the legal profession, has the dual mission of disciplining irregularities and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual organizations of the Board of Governors have suffered from illness due to their preference for discipline, loss of security and ill-treatment.

Since October 1, which tax revenues will affect our money bag?
The new personal income tax law of 1 October (journalist San) in Shanghai, Xinhua, will be in effect as of 1 January 2019, and in order to allow the general population to benefit from the tax reduction bonus as soon as possible, from 1 October, the amount actually earned by taxpayers will be deducted at the starting point of $5,000 per month and the new tax scale will be applied.
What are the benefits that will affect the people's money bags with the new deal coming to land?
The profit is one: the amount of tax relief paid to salaries is clear
A taxpayer who earns a salary after 1 October can deduct a basic deduction of $5,000 per month and apply a new scale of rates, with most taxpayers having varying degrees of tax deduction, especially for lower- and middle-income people.
According to the tax abatement table for the different income groups, the monthly income after the deduction of the "three-risk one" was $8,000, $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, and the tax liability was $90, $290, $1590,900, respectively. The corresponding tax deduction was 73.9 per cent, 61.1 per cent, 49.0 per cent, 18.8 per cent, compared to the starting point of $3500.
It is worth noting that, for holiday reasons, the salaries that the units were legally to pay at the end of September, which should have been paid in October, could be applied to the new basic cost deduction and tax schedule.
To this end, the withholding client software used by the tax authorities has been uniformly promoted to provide the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax is still required to be reported for payment during the statutory filing period.
Good two: low tax margins are significantly larger
In addition to raising the starting point, a new scale of taxes will be applied as of 1 October.
In this salary, the rate of seven tranches of salary earned has not changed, but there has been a marked change in the rate range, 3%, 10%, 20% of the lower tax range, 25% of the lower tax range has been reduced, while 30%, 35%, and 45% of the higher tax range has remained the same.
It is worth noting that the tax law also adjusts the rates for the various stages of production operations, of which the lower limit of the maximum 35 per cent rate is raised from $100,000 to $500,000.
This means that individual businesses, individual sole-owned partnerships, will benefit from tax changes.
" From the previous period ' s measurement of individual tax cuts for Shanghai taxpayers, the benefits of a tax reform will be fully felt by a wide range of taxpayers, particularly by the low- and middle-income population. "
The head of the personal income tax division of the Shanghai City Tax Office of the National Tax Administration said that.
Good three: tax services are easier to optimise
Since the publication of the new Personal Income Tax Act, the Shanghai City Tax Department has conducted a series of comprehensive and extensive tax advocacy actions.
On the one hand, policy mentoring on "one-on-one, point-to-point" is provided to priority tax sources.
The Pudong New Zone Tax Administration then visited large enterprises such as Apple Trade (Shanghai) Ltd., Pay Bao (China) Network Technology Ltd., Red Star America Kailong Home Group Inc., which have a large number of employees, a large withholding workload, a large amount of taxes paid, active counselling by the tax department, and answers to questions and questions; the Xuxi District Tax Administration visited the Region's large labour enterprises, China Jishang Economic and Technical Cooperation Ltd., etc., to collect business concerns in a timely manner, respond to business claims and address business difficulties.
On the other hand, the tax policy of "all-round, multi-dimensional, stereo" was introduced for a wide range of citizen taxpayers.
Use the official Shanghai tax website, micro-letter public numbers, microblogs, etc. to send policy hot spots in time to ensure that policy advocacy is in place.
At the same time, on 28 September, the Shanghai Tax Micro-Intelligence Public went online on the 12366 Smart Advisory Platform to conduct a "target-oriented" smart integrated tax reform advocacy service through the "Artificial + Smart" Tax Service.

A tripartite trade agreement between the United States and the United States of America would open up new opportunities for 500 million people.
According to outside media reports, a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and United States trade representative Letheize, published on the Canadian Government website, states that the United States, Canada and Mexico have reached a tripartite trade agreement that will be known as the " USMCA " (the US-Mega Trinational Agreement).

The statement stated: " Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement — the " USMCA Three Nations Agreement " , which will provide high-standard trade agreements for our workers, farmers and companies, which will lead to more freer markets, fairer trade and more sustainable economic growth ... which will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs and open up new opportunities for some 500 million people. "
It is known that the current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
. . . . . . . . . . . . following Trump's inauguration as President, it was announced that plans were being made to reconsider the agreement and sign a new one.
The three countries started this negotiation process in 2017.
The results of the early Okinawa office election, which resulted from the death of former chairman Yoon Yuzhi, were announced in the early morning hours of local time, against the successful election of Danny Yu, who was planning the relocation of U.S. military bases in Japan.
The vote was cast on 30 September, with the final results showing that Jade City received a total of 39.632 million votes, with the largest number of votes in Okinawa County's election history, more than 80,000 more votes than its main running opponent, Zo Xinjin.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24%, a drop of 0.89 percentage points over the 2014 Okinawa County Sheriff's election.
On 1 January, Yucheng stated to the media that the results of the election showed that the residents of the county did not want the effort of Young-Yong to be wasted, and that he would continue to work against the U.S. military base relocation plan and the closure of the U.S. government.
The U.S. military base, located in Yino Bay, Okinawa County, has been suffering from a long history of illness, and the Japanese and United States governments previously agreed to relocate it to the Wildo area of the city, but the Okinawan population strongly opposed it, hoping to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
In response to the relocation plan, which was strongly opposed by the residents of the county, and the withdrawal of the request for permission to fill the land off the border, Jade City stated that he had not been in opposition to and divided positions with the central government at first, and hoped that the two sides would have a full exchange of views, showing their intention to resolve it through consultations.
The Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, also stated to the media in the morning that he would take this outcome seriously and would work on revitalizing Okinawa and reducing the base burden.
In a press conference on 1 January, Japanese officials said that no change had been made in the Government's approach to the relocation of American military bases as soon as possible.
At the same time, he expressed his desire to talk to Jade City.
The Yucheng will officially take office as Governor of Okinawa County on 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseeds grew, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota in the United States, grew more and more soybeans in his land.
This shift peaked this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, on a scale never seen before.

For the first time in 35 years, American farmers have grown more soybeans this year than maize.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
China usually buys about 60 per cent of the soybean exports of the United States, but the price of soybean has fallen to a ten-year low as a result of trade wars, with almost zero purchases of soybeans in recent months.
. Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing dependence on crops that depend on China's demand.
. . . . . . . Thomas said that soybean prices "wrecked us in pain."

United States farmers have a record level of soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is expected to be a record high.
At such a time when they were vulnerable to shocks, they were hit by a trade battle.
In response to Trump's tariff on imported Chinese goods, China imposed import duties on imported United States soybeans in July.
The United States Department of Agriculture will issue its first estimate of the area planted next year, which is expected to include considerations of tariff impact.
The estimate is expected to confirm the expectation of private institutions that soybean seeding will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuters, on October 19, Informa Economics predicted an increase of 4 to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in maize cultivation in 2019, and a reduction of 7 to 83 million acres in soybean cultivation.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The soybeans planted before the imposition of retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million more than 10 years ago.
The area under maize cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008, to 89.1 million acres, and this year the area under wheat cultivation is 47.8 million acres, close to its lowest level in 100 years.

He claimed that it was possible to increase corn cultivation by up to 20% on his farm in northern Illinois; the state was the largest soybean-growing state in the United States.
Soybeans produce less per acre than corn, but require less fertilizer, which makes soybeans generally less expensive to grow.

The Xinhua International Times Review: Defending Multilateralism, China knows one thing.
The international rules and the multilateral order are under attack at a time when unilateralism is inverse.
to some extent, the intersection of unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible major Power, China has joined the international community in upholding multilateralism and promoting it as it continues to move forward, with the idea and solid action of the Hsiong-tao.
In the face of new challenges in the new situation, China made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As Wang Yi, Secretary of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs, said in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should be based on the goal of cooperation and win-winning, on a rules-based order, with equity and justice as its main purpose, and guided by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global development cooperation landscape with the United Nations at its core, North-South cooperation as the main channel, complemented by South-South cooperation, and for all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
. China's reflections and calls reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As President Espinosa of the 73rd session of the General Assembly said, in the current situation, " the United Nations needs more than ever to promote multilateralism and uphold a rule-based international system " .
The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Lagarde, said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, uphold the rules of international trade and resolve differences through consultations.
In recent years, with the adjustment of global economic and political forces, some emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged to play a greater role in major international multilateral mechanisms, providing a new impetus to development for counter-winding multilateralism.
In this dimension consideration, China's advocacy for building a large family rather than a small circle, insisting on multilateralism such as co-constructing rather than making winners eat, and following the trend of the times is a necessary choice to address global challenges and solve the world's difficulties, representing the common quest of most of the world's nations.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The "One Way" initiative put forward by China has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has initiated international and regional cooperation initiatives, such as the " One Way " , the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the " 16+1 Cooperation", to promote international regional cooperation, to perfect and complement existing international systems and order, to bring about innovation and dynamism for multilateral cooperation and to contribute to the promotion of a more just and rational development of the international order.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions are becoming stronger in this multilateral arena of the United Nations.
• Good offices to international hotspots, address climate change, participate in peacekeeping operations, contribute to poverty alleviation and help other countries implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Gutierrez, said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the "trust deficit" facing the world increases, and when populism and polarization rise, it is the world's most pressing need for multilateral cooperation.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to join hands to translate consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism and together contribute to the building of a community of human destiny.

Let us march forward with a great spirit, towards the great goal!

The fifth "Disabled Voice Month" came with a focus on sexuality education for disabled adolescents - China New Network
In recent years, the topic of adolescent sex education in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge for adolescents with disabilities is still daunting.
In recent days, a seminar on comprehensive sexuality education challenges and practical strategies for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to provide sex education to disabled children and youth is an important topic of this seminar.
The report on sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of children with disabilities and youth in China, released at the conference, shows that children with disabilities are subjected to sexual harassment and that the rate of sexual assault is higher than that of healthy children.
In the case of disabled children, adolescents, more attention is also given to "sexual protection" in society.
The objective of this seminar is to promote comprehensive sexuality education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China in the areas of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support to children and adolescents with disabilities from the source so that they have the same right to enjoy love as others.
The experts believe that the public awareness of disabled groups in Chinese society has remained at a level that is not deep enough.
In China, influenced by such factors as traditional attitudes, comprehensive sex education for persons with disabilities, especially children and adolescents, is not sufficiently deep.
In recent years, however, with the support of UNESCO and the public service, there has been a welcome development of education practices and pathways for sexual and reproductive health education that have been fully developed throughout the cycle of Chinese persons with disabilities.
The Report shows that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical impairments have more difficulty in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships than the general population, but have generally developed easily and enriched.
The Workshop on Challenges and Practical Strategies for Comprehensive Sex Education for Persons with Disabilities, organized by the Shanghai Foundation for the Public Interest of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in China, the Beijing office of the International Alliance for the Disabled (France) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in China, is aimed at exploring, in the context of a major strategy for health in China, the full cycle of fully developed sexual and reproductive health education practices and pathways for persons with disabilities, promoting policy makers in the field of special education and inclusive education, educators, researchers, social service organizations, and representatives of parents, among other stakeholders, the right to health of children and young people with disabilities to an understanding of the international policy on comprehensive sexuality education; extensive exchanges on sex education practices, strategies, challenges and resources for children and young people with disabilities in the country, discussing and developing a blueprint for future comprehensive sexuality education for children with disabilities and young people, creating a network of support.

The Central Bank's previous data show that by the end of August last year the Central Bank held a total of $6,044 million in vacant positions in foreign currency over forward and future contracts, the fourth consecutive month; the size of the vacant positions in SDR (special drawing rights) was $4,276 million in size.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange position has been empty for the long term.
The central bank first published the data at the end of March 2016; the data show that the central bank's foreign currency at the end of February 2016 had more than $2.438 billion in positions and $28.9 billion in empty positions against forward and future contracts.
The September data published at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of $16,401 million to $45,301 million for the first time.
The Central Bank has previously stated that the forward and futures position of foreign currency vis-à-vis the currency mainly reflects the forward foreign exchange operations undertaken by the Central Bank with commercial banks to meet the foreign currency liability hedge demand of the enterprise, and will continue to provide long-term risk avoidance products based on the need principle, which will have less impact on the size of future foreign exchange reserves.

The two-hour drive, the trainmaster persuaded him that one hour was still ineffective.
At the end of the day, a male passenger in the same car couldn't watch to pull the man up.
From the point of view, although most of the end result is public condemnation, administrative punishment by the public security services and even inclusion on the Integrity Blacklist, the public still feels that it is not " undefeated " : why not allow the hegemonics to be punished on the spot?
Why should it not be possible to stop its immoral and even unlawful conduct on the spot, but rather to punish it afterwards?
And how can a male passenger be dragged up for his unconscionable actions?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police officers, and short-distance trains are generally not; even when there are police officers, the police are more concerned about the possible rogue reaction of the hegemonics than with the forced removal measures.
The repeated instances of hegemonic events make people aware that the hegemons must be forcibly taken away and even punished on the spot in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our trains take strong measures in a timely manner, and that trains that do not take the police should be equipped as soon as possible to keep the violations stopped and suppressed in a timely manner.
On 1 October, on the first day of the national holiday, vehicles in the direction of Matsupan, Sichuan Kitagawa Autonomous District, went to Mow County.

At 8.05 a.m. yesterday morning, two suspects of theft were captured while they were stealing from the 20th bus, Yongting Gate Station, to the Pearl City Pass Station.
The two poaching men cut the passengers' coats, stole $800 of the cash, and let the civilian police who had long been on their side grab it.
This was the first case of plagiarism solved by Beijing police during the Fourth of July.
At more than 5 a.m. yesterday morning, the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Brigade counter-intelligence investigators reached their intended location.
According to past experience, places where people are concentrated, bus hubs, and bus subway lines, including in Tiananmen Square, among the people watching the flag raise, are the focus areas of their work.
In the flow of people, plain-clothed civilian police calmly observe past crowds.
At more than 7 a.m., investigators who were squatting at the bus station found two suspicious male tails on the 20th bus with a male passenger from the Yongting Gate station.
In the car, two suspicious men, one to the left and one to the right, caught the male passengers in the middle, one of whom tried to cover the other.
They don't know, however, that every move of theirs has long fallen into the eyes of plainclothes police officers watching.
The " thief grabs the thief " , the civilian police in plain clothes grabs the man and, while waiting for the man to steal, the civilian police stares at the man who is ready to steal and is caught by the investigators just after they have stolen his hand.
The Beijing Morning Herald reporter saw that the civilian police seized $800 in cash from a suspected thief.
"This money was taken from the passenger's clothes."
The civilian police pointed to a broken jacket pocket and said, " They cut it off and stole $800 from a visitor who came to Kyoto, and when we caught them, the money was just loaded into their own pocket. "
The journalists learned that, in order to catch the two, civilian police officers in civilian clothes had followed for an hour and had finally been captured while they were doing the crime.
Two suspects are currently under police review.
The civilian police in plain clothes told reporters who was suspicious in the crowd, and the question was simple for the civilian police.
"If the thief is caught more, they will find out that their eyes, demeanor and ordinary passengers are different, and that, in addition to staring at their pockets and backpacks, they like to drill in the crowd instead of hiding from people. "
The civilian police also told reporters that the suspect often had no purpose in waiting for the car, likes to wander around the station and find the object of the theft before he ends up in the car.
"It's all about experience. It's been dry for a long time, and you'll know it. "
In addition, the civilian police suggested that " the outer garments are the most convenient and vulnerable to theft " .

For this reason, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular requiring the implementation of the new national logo at the site of the movement of synthetic material surfaced in primary and secondary schools for use after 1 November of this year.
The mandatory national standard, "Synthetic Materials Surface Campaign Sites for Primary and Secondary Schools", was organized by the Ministry of Education with the participation of 26 research institutes and testing agencies and was revised over two years, during which more than 100 expert meetings were organized, as well as field visits throughout the country, sample tests, and the collection of numerous validation experiments on hundreds of business products on the market.
According to the old State logo of 2005, journalists found that the new State flag not only changed from a " national recommended standard " to a " national mandatory standard " , but also added a number of elements, including thickness requirements, physical performance, age-resistant performance, inorganic filling content requirements, requirements for high concentration content against smoother particles, limits on hazardous material for surface finished products, limits on hazardous substances for non-solid and solid raw materials, etc.
In particular, it is worth mentioning that the new national sign limits the amount of hazardous substances that may be produced in the construction of the campus plastic runway, from the original 7 to 18 items, and regulates the amount of volatile organic matter in the built runway in accordance with home standards.
If the release of hazardous substances is specified in the "limits and odour requirements for harmful substances in current watering and prefabricated face formations", it is required that total volatile organic compounds should not exceed 5 mg/m3, formaldehyde should not exceed 0.4 mg/m3, disulfide carbon should not exceed 7 mg/m3, benzene should not exceed 0.1 mg/m3, and the odour level should not exceed 3 levels.
The new national sign also details sampling requirements for plastic runways on primary and secondary school campuses, test rules, sentencing rules, etc.

To activate rural consumption, the normalization mechanism will be used to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption and increase the sense of access to farmers ' consumption.
The data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, with retail sales of rural consumer goods growing 10.5 per cent in the first half of the year, at 1.3 percentage points above that of towns.
In a poor village in a county in the west, there was only one convenience store in the village, going into it, and some of the goods seemed to have known each other, "Golden Dragonfish" marked "Golden Dragon Oil", "Wang Boy" became "Big Milk", and "Mounty Castle" goods were numerous.

A consumption survey report published by a city in the west showed that rural businesses had a serious problem with over-false goods, with 66 per cent of users having bought counterfeit goods at supermarkets under the township line, of which food accounted for more than half.
Why is Li Ging still being beaten up by the authorities that are trying to fix the rural market?
In contrast to the urban market, farmers are less aware of their rights, and, together with the remoteness of many rural areas, they are in a blind zone with inadequate regulatory power, giving fertile ground to counterfeit goods.

The lack of long-term regulatory mechanisms, the difficulty of purifying rural markets, the low cost of violating laws and the high interest in them have led to the emergence of "uphills" and "downhills" by some illegal traders, with some rural areas becoming "bridled markets " .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Today, the central party, the State Council, issued " a number of opinions on improving the institutional mechanisms for promoting consumption and further boosting the consumption potential of the population " , in which it was proposed to promote the upgrading of consumption ladders for the rural population, with the aim of making it possible for a large number of farmers " to consume " willing to consume " and " dare to consume " , so that rural consumption can really flourish.
On the one hand, there is a need to deepen reforms, eliminate market regulatory polity, multiple regulatory malpractices, tailor-made, sound food safety, product quality monitoring networks, and continuously compress the space for rural fakes to sell them.
On the other hand, greater law enforcement and the regulation of " capillary blood vessels " will never allow the spread of hypocritical feats in rural areas.
The strict punishment of pit farmers is the carer, and no matter how hidden the faker hides, should be the reason for the growth of the bad commodity, and the relevant departments should be clear about their responsibilities, the power of grass-roots supervision sunk, and which links are in question, and be held accountable for making the fake and selling them without a place to hide.
• Strictly close market access, impose strict eligibility checks on producers, keep market circulations open, let the product go straight, go clear, and find a way from source, root, to reassure legal distributors to operate, so that farmers can buy.
. Activate rural consumption to guide health consumption demand.
As consumption escalates, many farmers not only seek to feed, eat well, but also to pursue high-quality lives such as culture, health, etc., which do not allow rural markets to compete with "low-quality" "low-cost" paintings.
This requires promoting e-commerce to extend rural coverage to a wide range of rural areas, opening up urban and rural two-way distribution channels, promoting a combination of sub-line industry development platforms and online powerer trading platforms, and supporting the expansion of new patterns of consumption to rural markets; promoting the organic integration of commercial logistics with recreational agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc. in the conditionalities of the townships; and improving modern rural circulation networks, optimizing the integration of storage facilities resources and effectively reducing rural circulation costs.
The creation of a clear, secure market environment for rural areas, allowing farmers to consume less and rural consumption to grow more and more, and to improve farmers' sense of access to consumption and happiness.
Since 1 November, we have reduced the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rate for some commodities, and the total tariff level will be reduced to 7.5 per cent.
In accordance with the decision of the 26th General Meeting of the State Council, the State Council Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs issued a bulletin on 30 November 2018 to reduce most-favoured-nation rates for some commodities, effective 1 November 2018.
According to the " Bulletin of the State Council ' s Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs on the Reduction of Tariffs on Imports of Selected Commodities " , most-favoured-nation rates for commodities such as certain industrial goods have been reduced as of 1 November this year, in order to adapt to industrial upgrading, reduce the cost of businesses and meet the needs of the population at multiple levels of consumption.
A total of 1585 tax items, or about 19% of our total tax line, were reduced from 10.5% to 7.8% on average, with an average reduction of 26%.
This tax reduction mainly relates to textiles; stone, ceramics, glass products; parts of steel and base metal products; electromechanical equipment and parts such as metalworking machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, transmission equipment, electrical equipment, instrumentation meters, etc.; resource commodities and primary processed products such as non-metallic mines, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, and pomegranate stones.
At the same time, with the overall level of customs duties, in particular medicines, the daily tariff on imports of consumer goods is adjusted downwards and the tax rate on imports of imported goods is adjusted downwards accordingly.
In order to follow up on the party's central, State Council decision-making deployments, we have imposed zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported medicines since 1 May of this year, lower tariffs on cars and spare parts from 1 July, import duties on some daily consumer goods, and a third-step reduction in the information technology agreement for the extension of products.
The journalists learned from the Department of State Committee on Customs and Excise that, since this year, our total tariff level has been reduced from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent, with an average reduction of 23 per cent.
The appropriate reduction of tariffs will contribute to the balanced development of foreign trade and a higher level of external openness, as well as to the integrated use of both international and domestic resources to advance domestic supply-side structural reforms.
The relevant head of the Committee said that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the reform and opening up, and that the proactive reduction of the overall level of tariffs is a practical action to implement the spirit of the important statement made by the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping at the Asian Forum and an important initiative of the country to further expand its openness and proactively expand its imports in line with its high-quality development needs, which demonstrate China ' s firm commitment to a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy that, while enhancing its own dynamic of development, will also make China ' s development more beneficial to the world.
On 29 September, the regional public brand release of the "Circumnaires" agricultural products in Kansu province, South Kai District, Tianjin city, was held.
The Red Army millet, the black beans, the mountain children, the Montenegrin sheep, the fine tea, the paper-cut filmlet, the pure hand-crafted slippers... a piece of finely packed agricultural produce is placed on the stands, and they have a common brand name called "The Ringers."
The regional branding of the ‘circles' effectively addressed the development bottlenecks of the ‘mixed, small and weak' agricultural products of the surrounding county, and became a powerful vehicle for the fight against poverty. "29, the regional public brand release of the ‘circles' agricultural products sponsored by Gansu County will be held in the South Kai District of Tianjin City.
The surrounding county is at the intersection of the three provinces of Shaan Ganing, as "an advanced county for national food production " , " a village of Chinese small and groceries " , " a village of Chinese skin shadows " , with a long history and a wealth of resources.

As the level of urbanization in China grew, the urban population grew rapidly and a large number of young people in rural areas left their homes to start urban life.
The Chinese agricultural brand research expert, Yang Katsuja, said: " Urban life is now fast, under stress, and more and more people are beginning to miss rural life as a child, but, ‘The ‘never going home, the most beautiful memory is the country ' , and the ‘neighbors' brand is designed to be named for the country and the country of the people who wander around the county outside. ' "
The Circus County has special climatic conditions, long daylight hours, high day and night temperatures, and uniquely rich conditions for small and groceries.
The country produces more than 20 small groceries and is home to China's small groceries, with the highest production in Gansu and the highest quality in the country.
Wang Xiao Li, a Zhong County girl who attended school in Tianjin this time as a volunteer, said, " The people of his hometown are the closest and the country smells the most beautiful, and the ‘Rounds of the Ring' brand has caught up with too much of our country, remembering, and remembering the good foods of the time, hoping that the ‘Rounds of the Rings' brand will get farther and bigger."
Dr. Tambin, a researcher at the Scientific Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve Agency, said that the detection of agricultural products such as wheat, bitterness, and black beans in the county had a strong advantage through the testing of more than 900 sets of indicators, that many of the groceries had higher levels of physiologically active substances than standard data, and that the " ring dwellers" had an inherent advantage in capturing the domestic high-end groceries market.

The Korea's first joint expedition to the Han River into the sea in 65 years.
The Korean Ministry of Defence confirmed on 5th that the Korean dynasty launched a joint expedition into the waters of Han and Zinjiang into the mouth of the sea on the same day.
The initiative is a pre-position to guarantee the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
The South Korean Ministry of Defence's briefing to the media on the same day indicated that it was the first time that the parties had conducted a joint expedition to Hanjiang into the sea port since the signing of the 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement.
The Koreans signed a military agreement in September this year, agreeing that a joint tour of the waters such as the Hanjiang into the sea mouth will begin in November to guarantee the environmental protection of the waters at a later date, the development of tourism, etc.
In October, the Koreans planned a joint expedition to the waters at a general-level meeting.
On 5 November, a joint Korean-Korean water expedition was officially launched.
The joint mission consisted of 20 people, including the Korean military, experts and others.
According to the Korean Ministry of Defence, neither party carried weapons during this mission and prohibited the use of words and actions that stimulated each other.
" Because of the absence of a military demarcation line near the entrance to the sea, the area was once an unexpectedly high-rise area, but through joint expeditions, it will become a new peace zone in the future ... "
The total length of the waters of this joint Korean-Korean expedition is about 70 kilometres, with a total area of about 280 square kilometres.
The Korean Ministry of Defence informed that the Korean side would send six cruise ships to detect seawater depths, etc., to provide basic information for the safe navigation of the waters; a navigation map would be provided for civilian ship movements after the investigation had been completed.
The Koreans had held summit talks in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on the joint use of the Han and Zinjiang into the sea, but the follow-up negotiations were stranded due to the tense situation in the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the Koreans in September, future vessels of both sides need to be informed in advance of each other before sailing in common waters.

The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and interests and security of its citizens in Mong China, and to consular protection and assistance.
Upon learning of the loss of contact between the two tourists, the Embassy immediately launched an emergency plan for securing security, seeking to seize the golden rescue time and do its best.
The Embassy maintains close communication with the families of the individuals concerned, assists them in immediately reporting the incident to the police and provides the families with an translated list for their choice.
The Embassy met with the Ministry of External Relations of Mongolia, the Police General Directorate, the Head of the Emergency Directorate, to inform them of the situation, to request that the investigation and rescue be carried out as soon as possible and to maintain close communication with the Mon party throughout the search and rescue process to ensure that the latest developments are kept up to date.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the family in issuing a search for people in Monk and extensively engaged with the Monghua expatriates and Chinese-owned businesses to find people, provide effective leads and provide relevant assistance to several Blue Sky rescue workers who went to Monn to assist in the rescue.

The Mon Police Directorate and the Emergency Directorate instructed the police and the emergency department of Kusugur Province to search and rescue in full.
Since Lake Kusugur is located on the northern border of Mongolia with Russia, is remote, sparsely populated, and extremely difficult to transport and communicate, and is now entering the harsh winter with a low temperature of about 20 degrees below zero, local police and emergency departments have overcome enormous difficulties by mobilizing almost all of their police forces and by launching local pastoralists, carrying out carpet search and rescue on a wide range of consecutive days around the lost positions of the two.
At the same time, in response to the particular situation of the pastoral areas, Monfondo has been publishing a search for people through the radio cycle for days.
The relevant staff of the national blue sky rescue team have also come to join Mong Fang in active participation in the rescue.
The safety of the two missing persons has always touched our hearts.
So far, more than a decade has passed since the two were lost, the Embassy has received some leads, but no two have been found, and search and rescue operations are still under stress.
The Embassy will always follow the matter on the basis of the "people-centred" principle, prompting Mon to continue to do its utmost to search and rescue and to provide maximum assistance to the families of the individuals concerned.
The Embassy called for contact with the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia for the first time in the case of Monk and businesses, if they were informed of the relevant leads.
