members of the Welsh National Assembly are concerned that ‘looks like a wire puppet'.
Some members of the Assembly were shocked by their proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is that the plan is to change the name of the council to the Welsh parliament.
Members of parliament from all political parties fear that they might be making fun of it.
A Labour MP said that his organization was concerned that "there would still be Pwp in touch with Twp."
For readers other than Wales: twp means stupidity in Welsh, pwp means poop.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A Welsh conservative said that his organization was "open" to the change of name, but noted that there was only a short section of the way from MWP to wire puppets.
In this context, the Welsh letter w has a similar pronunciation to that of the Yorkshire letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, said: " The final decision on any description of the names of the members of the Council is, of course, the decision of the members themselves. "
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposal, finding that there was widespread public support for calling the council the Welsh Parliament.
On the question of the name of the councillor, the committee was inclined to be a member of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, although MWP received the most support in the public consultation.

The legislation on reform will include changes to the way the council works, including rules on the removal of membership and the design of the committee system.
During the debate on the legislative process, the councillor will make a final decision on the question why they should be called.
The Macedonians voted to change the name of the country.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The referendum was set up to resolve decades of disputes with neighboring Greece, which had its own province called Macedonia.

President Gölgeivanov of Macedonia, who was opposed to the referendum, said that he would not listen to the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum within the Department, including Prime Minister Zoran Shaeve, believe that the change of name is only the cost of joining the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in the battle of Harlem's church.
Mr. Adams said, "Historyly speaking, the old man who talked to me, there's a bar in every corner with the same church."
"and home, both of them are gone. "
He said that the disappearance of the bar was understandable.
He said, "The family's way of socializing isn't the same."
"No more bars, no more community halls that you're going to go to."
As for the Church, it was concerned that the money that sold the assets would not be as durable as the leaders expected, "they would sooner or later return to where they started."
It adds that the church may be replaced by apartment buildings, which are filled with people who are not willing to help the remaining shelters in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white, "he says," and so, the churches will close very quickly, because most people who move into the apartments are not too likely to be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan-metropolitan community in 1870, while Saint Martin's church was ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that's been working nearby has acquired ownership of the building.
The black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Jensen took over the Church of St. Martin, who led a campaign against the 125th Street retailers, a major shopping street in Harlem, which they refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but when Father Jensen's parish residents developed a reconstruction plan, they commissioned the bell.
Father Jensen, son, Reverend David Jensen, the successor to St. Martin's Church, is proud to call this bell "the bell of the poor."
The experts who played the big bell in July called it "cultural treasure" as "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The Tiffany Ng expert from the University of Michigan also noted that the first clock in the world played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind had moved to the bell at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's Church didn't replace him.
In the past few months, the church of St. Martin has had a complex story about architects and contractors, some of which were brought by the church's lay leaders, and others by the Anglican parish.

His entire lock bone was torn off, "Hamel's word, she noticed it as soon as she got to the boy.
"I swooped at everyone and told them to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' "Hamel added.
The boy was flown to the Reddie Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was listed as a critical situation.
The type of shark that caused this attack is unknown.

As part of the substantial promotion of the UK £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow at the same time as fashion and household goods sales fall, larger beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if proven successful, in more stores next year.
While investing in beauty, supermarkets are looking for ways to take advantage of the shelf space of television, microwaves and domestic appliances that have been prosecuted.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . would double the scale of its beauty products to 3,000, including the brands of Luhuamin, Essie, Dissyman and Dr. Muggle.

The supermarket will re-launch a series of fine cosmetics so that most products belong to the vegetarian-friendly type - which is the demand of the growing number of young purchasers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fengfang will try to operate with special permission in two stores in Cairnsbury, the first of which opened last week in Creedon, in southern London, and the second in Celinaoc, Birmingham, in the second half of this year.
The shift in online shopping and the purchase of a small amount of food in local convenience stores every day means that the supermarket has to do more to convince people to visit.
. . . . . . . . . Michael Cooper, CEO of Cairnsbury, said that as the chain supermarket tries to counter the discounters Aldi and Liddle with more services and non-food, these stores will become more and more like department stores.
. . . . . . since the purchase of the two chains two years ago, Cairnsbury has been setting up the Agos Orettes mall in hundreds of stores, and has also led into a number of production sites, which the company has said has boosted the sale of grocery stores, making the buying more profitable.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to transform the beauty and pharmacy department ended in failure.
In the early 21st century, Cairnsbury tried to establish a joint venture with Bott, but there was a dispute over how to distribute the revenues of the Mottress store in the supermarket, and the collaboration between the two ends.
Three years ago, Cairnsbury sold its 281 stores to the owner of Lloyd's pharmacy chain for £125 million.

"We've changed the look and feel of the beauty channel to improve the customer's environment.
We also hired our trained colleagues to give advice at any time.
Our brand series is designed to meet the needs, attraction and convenience of the environment, which means that we are a notable destination for beauty, challenging the old way of shopping. "
Peter Jones is a "bitter" after Holly Willoughby quits a £11 million deal.
After TV show host Holly Willoughby dropped out of a £11 million deal in his lifestyle brand business, focusing on a new contract with Martha's department store and the independent television station, Dragon Cave star Peter Jones ‘Anger' left.
Willoughby had no time to look at their home uniforms and accessories brand Truley.
The two men's business was once compared to Gwenice Patello's Kamp brand.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" column host announced on Instagram that she would leave.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . at the very last moment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in the last . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The news is that on Tuesday, at a press conference at the commercial imperial headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, a well-known woman from the television community admitted that her new contract, valued at £1.5 million, meant that she would not have enough time to go to their home dress-coding brand, Truley, and Jones was "very angry" at it.
The industry was compared to the Gwinice Patello's generalist brand and was thought to double Willow's approximately £11 million in wealth.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones left England on a plane to go to one of his resorts.
According to the news, "To date, Truly is Holly's top priority.
This will be her long-term future, and it will be seen in the next few decades.
The decision that he pulled out was a shock to everyone.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday is too close to the market.
The Malo headquarters has a warehouse filled with sun for sale. "
The experts believe that, as one of the most valuable stars in the United Kingdom, the departure of this morning's column hosts may have led to millions of losses to the company, as the company's investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to costumes and home uniforms is very large and could further delay listing.
And that might mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of the three little friends, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tarakap, for ten years.
. . . . . Willoughby founded the Truly Company with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the board of directors in March.
On vacation with the couple, Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
. . . . Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ante McPalin as the host of the independent television station, "I'm a celebrity."
A source close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on her business. "

The joke is that it will be criticized by the news media for having published a review that is considered "non-presidential" and a very positive attitude towards Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump used the voice of his model news anchor.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim Jong-un was interested in holding a second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a major step towards denuclearization in Korea.
But talks about denuclearization have been deadlocked.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, the top Korean diplomat, Li Yong Ho, spoke to the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was not willing to accept any form of negotiations.[citation needed] On Saturday, the United Nations General Assembly stated that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had not seen a "corresponding response" by the United States to the early disarmament actions of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
On the contrary, it pointed out that the United States was continuing to impose sanctions and to maintain pressure on it.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We did well on the Korean question," he said.
"We're going to war with Joseon.
Millions of people will be killed.
And we have a very good relationship. "
It said that its efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong-un had yielded positive results - the end of rocket trials, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers to the United States.
It also defended its unusual practice of talking about its relationship with Kim Jong-un.
"It's too easy to be president, but it's not 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, and it's about 200 people standing there." Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, in the wake of the Long Island earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they didn't need them.
. Despite the loss of more than 10 per cent of the population of Ryukoshima, no national disaster was declared, and this was a pre-condition for international assistance.
Ms. Sambun said, "Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they don't want international assistance, so there are some challenges,"

Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A medical ship in Long Island to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palou, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
The President, Zokovido, has made improvements to Indonesia's damaged infrastructure as a core element of its campaign, and has invested a lot of money along the road and rail.
But, the shortage of funds has been haunting Mr. Zoko's government, as he will face a re-election next year.
Mr. Zoko is also under pressure from the denominational tensions that Indonesia is not going to command, and the majority of Muslim members on the side have accepted a more conservative form of faith.

Daniel Studridge of Liverpool tied the match with his opponent.
On Saturday, at Stanford Bridge Field, London, Danielsturić saved Liverpool's fate in the 89th minute in the British Super League.
Sturić received a pass from Sherdan Shachi, about 30 yards from the car's Luthor Gate, when his team fell behind by 1–0.
He gently shoots the ball at his left and then kicks it at the far end of the pole.
When the ball flew to the top right corner of the goal, it flew over the penalty area.
The ball finally fell to the jumping Kaipa Arisavaraga and fell into the net.
"I'm just trying to get into a position, grab the ball, like Shak, and kick as much as I can, so I'm just trying to make time for myself," he said to the Liverpool Football Club.
"I saw Canter pass, and I finished the ball, and without so much, I shot straight at the door. "

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr. Krick's advice as "soft" and "intending to rewrite history."
The president of the Cromwell Association, John Goldsmith, noted that "the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell from outside the House of Westminster as a goal is inevitable in the current discussions.
The worship of idols in the British Civil War was neither an order of Cromwell nor his practice.
Or the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his predecessor, Zutomas, did in the last century.
The grande description of Cromwell by Sir William Hammo Sonikrovt confirms the 19th-century view, and is also part of the history of people who many consider to be celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith telegraphed to Sunday: "Many people, in particular, believed in the late 19th century that the Cromwell Department would resist the defenders of external pressure, and of course he was made by the monarch at that time."
What the hell is this fascinated by a perfectly accurate representation that remains the subject of a later historical discussion?
The conflict of the 17th century can be ascertained to have led to the development of our national day, and Cromwell was recognized as the representative of the other side of the conflict at that time.
His achievements as the Protectorate are also worthy of our celebration and remembrance. "
A Chinese farmer was bitten by a pig.
According to local media reports, a farmer in southwest China was bitten by a pig in the market.
According to the South China Morning Herald Sunday report, the man's name, Yuan, was found lying in the market of the blood-stained Guizhou province's six-piece water market, dying of a severe arterial break, and the death of the man.
- A pig farmer located in Sining City, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005 is preparing to inoculate pigs in pig breeding grounds.

The rest of the storm, Rosa, brought widespread storms to the southwestern United States.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . as it was predicted that Hurricane Rosa had gradually weakened as it moved to colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But next time Rosa will continue to bring heavy rains to northern Mexico and southwestern America.
As of 5:00 a.m., the winds of Hurricane Rosa reach 85 miles per hour, still a Category I hurricane. Eastern time is Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Yuginia, Mexico.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the same time, a low-pressure slot is being formed over the Pacific Ocean and heading east towards the west coast of the United States. Monday will bring deep heat and water to the south-western United States region as Rosa's hot-band storm approaches the California Peninsula.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to Mexico's local area.
The next result is the interaction between hot water and the nearby low cyclone, which will bring widespread and intense rainfall to the southwest region.
The rainfall of 1 to 4 inches in the local area will cause flash floods, mudslides and landslides.
Thermal water vapor will lead to rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.

The heavy rains will cover the four sectors on Tuesday and Wednesday next.
In October, with the cooling of the North Pole, some dramatic changes in temperature have occurred throughout the United States, but the hot zone remains relatively warm.
Sometimes it leads to short-term changes in the temperature of the storm.
A clear example is the strong temperature difference that the Central American region experienced on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri City, Omaha City, Nebraska and St. Louis City and Moines, Iowa is close to 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer sun will warm up again on a larger scale.
The warmest October in most parts of the Middle East of the United States is expected to cover 80 per cent of the area from the southern plain to the northeast.
The New York city temperature can reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, about 10 degrees Fahrenheit above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests that the eastern temperatures of the United States in the first half of October will be higher than average.

It was on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote that the police clashed with Catalan separatist forces.
On Saturday, thousands of people from Barcelona participated in a demonstration against Catalonia's first anniversary of independence, and six pro-independence demonstrators were arrested in clashes with riot police.
A group of masked separatists were stopped by riot police, who threw eggs and powdered paint at riot police, squeezing the streets filled with tourists to raise their smokes.
There was also a conflict that night when the police used the baton to control it.
The pro-independence groups chanted the slogan "Not to forget, not to forgive" for several hours in a row, and they shouted, "All hail Spain."
According to local media reports, 14 people were slightly injured during the demonstrations and needed treatment.
A year after the October 1 referendum celebrated by the Catalan separatists was recognized by Madrid as an illegal referendum, the situation in the region, which is surrounded by independent ideas, remains tense.
The voters chose independence by crushing the number of votes, however the low turnout and the majority of the residents opposed to the vote boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, violent clashes occurred in the old years when police tried to stop polling stations in the area, resulting in approximately 1,000 injuries.
The pro-independence group camped all night Friday night to stop demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration, though carried out, was forced to follow other routes.
A 68-year-old electrician, Nasistermr, along with his wife, participated in the split demonstration and stated that he no longer had hope for Catalonia's independence.
"We've had the best of one's life in the old years.
I saw my parents wept because they could vote for joy, but we were trapped," he said.
Although the previous December was a crucial victory in the regional elections, the Catalan pro-independence parties are today trying to maintain this position, although many of the famous leaders are either exiled or awaiting trial for organizing a referendum and declaring independence.

The 41-year-old West used the nickname Jay for some time, and he also used the nickname as the eighth album name, which was released in June.
The change occurred before he appeared at the Saturday Night scene, where he was expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
The show's founder said it replaced the singer who had cancelled the show for "emotional reasons", Elena Grande.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has spoken about this word before for religious purposes.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word of the Bible, spoken in the first half of this year when he comes to the Bible and he means 'you'," West discusses his album name with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, I'm us.
It turned from the only Kanye to the only Yes, which is our good, our bad, our confusion, our reflection of everything.
That's more about the album. "
He's one of the most famous rappers.
. . . . . . . Sean Cums was known as "Puff Daddy", "P. Didi" or "Didi", but this year she declared "love" more moderately with "brother love."
. West's former collaborators, JAY-Z, also use or do not use coupons and uppercase letters.

The U.S. should double the funding of artificial intelligence.
The investors and artificial intelligents who used to work in grain songs, Microsoft and apples, Lee Kaiji, said that the United States should double its research spending in that area as China became more active in artificially intelligent fields.
The comments were made following the issuance of an artificial intelligence bulletin by various government departments in the United States, despite the lack of a formal artificial intelligence strategy in the United States overall.
In the meantime, China launched its project last year: its goal is to become the number one field of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . since all other countries are far behind America, doubling the budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, and we are looking for the next breakthrough for artificial intelligence."
In a CNC interview this week, Lee said that doubling the funding would double the chances of the next major artificial intelligence achievement in the United States.
Li, her book Artificial Intelligence Superpower: China, Shigeo and the New World Order was published this month by Hotton Miflin Harcourt, CEO of China Innovation Investment Corporation, which invested in Face++, one of China's most famous Artificial Intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University and developed a one-man engineering intelligence system, defeating the highest ranking American Osello chess player, who later served as executive director at Microsoft Institute and as president of the Chinese branch of the Valley Songs.

According to Li, the National Fund for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to academic institutions, similar to the way in which the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding to American researchers, but is of lower quality in Chinese academic work.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a United Artificial Intelligence Center, aimed at attracting partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, investments in artificial intelligence research currently exceed $100 million per year.

The Macedonians are conducting a referendum on whether or not to change their country's name.
On Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum to decide whether to change their country's name to the "North Macedonia Republic", which would resolve a dispute with Greece, which had prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO for decades.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia, which insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents its sovereignty over its territory and rejects its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that this change would undermine the racial recognition of much of the Macedonian Slavic population.
President Georgy Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the minimum 50 per cent required for the referendum to be effective would be reached.
The question for the referendum was: " Are you in favour of joining NATO and the European Union and accepting an agreement with Greece? "
In the opinion of supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Sayev, Macedonia was one of the countries that emerged after the Yugoslav dissolution, and was worth the price of fighting for membership in institutions such as the European Union and NATO.
The 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska, speaking in Skopje, said, "I'm here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means that all of our lives will be safer."

The change of name will require more than two thirds of the Parliament to pass.
The National Electoral Commission stated that as of 1 p.m. there were no reports of irregularities.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
The 62-year-old Gjos Tanevsky, a voter in Skopje, said, "I came out to vote for my little friend, and Europe is where we are. "

In front of the council building in Skopje, fifty-four-year-old Vladimir Kavaldakov was preparing a small stage and pulling a stool in front of some of the tents built by those who resisted the referendum.
"We support NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with a sober mind, not through the service door."
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to be Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asian system.
The Prime Minister said that joining NATO would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which had a unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that most of us will agree, because more than 80% of our citizens support the European Union and NATO," said Shaoyev after the vote.
He said, "Approval" would result in "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required turnout.
The other poll, conducted by the Macedonian Telma Television, showed that 57 per cent of respondents voted on Sundays.
Seventy percent of them said they'd vote for it.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the turnout must reach 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow by a Western government since it took over in May of the previous year.
The Mantown team, Sergio Argueiro, has scored the goal across the entire Brighton line.
On Saturday, at Manchester Itihad Field, England, in a 2-0 big win over Brighton in Mantown, Sergio Argueiro and Rahim Sterling broke through Brighton's line.
Aguiro's goal in the 65th minute was so easy to see.
The Argentine forward received a pass in midfield at the start of the game.
It runs between three Brighton rearguards and then rushes towards the open ground.
Aguiro then found himself surrounded by four green shirt players.
It bypassed a guard, and then crossed a few people on the edge of Brighton's restricted zone.
And then it passes the ball to the left and hits Sterling.
The British forward sent the ball back to Aguiro with his first touch in the restricted zone, where he shot the ball to the right, defeating Brighton Gate and Matthew Ryan.
The Mantown team manager Guadiola told reporters, "Aguiro struggles for the problems of his feet."
"We talked about it playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're so lucky that he scored a goal in a moment. "
But in the mixed battle of the British Super League, Sterling gave the Sky Blues their original advantage.
That goal appeared in the 29th minute.
Aguiro got the ball in the middle of Brighton's defensive zone.
It sent a good straight to Baleroi Sané on the left.
Sane made a few touchballs before drawing Sterling to the distant poles.
The front of the Blues of the Sky is putting the ball on the net before it slips out of the border.
At 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday, the Mantown team played the Champions League squad with the Hoffinheims at the Rhinenecka Stadium in Singsham, Germany.
Shelze wanted to play the vandals in the war, the Rockys.
As the national team was eliminated in the playoffs, there was little reason to force the team to start over.
But Shelze, who has always been a winner, wants to play on Sunday against the Colorado Lokis, but the premise is that the Lokis still have a playoff influence, and they're leading one by the Los Angeles Dodgers in western North Carolina.
The Lokis won the national team 5-2 on Friday night, locking at least one outer card seat, but they still look forward to locking the first division title.
"Although we played it for nothing, we could at least stand up on the pitcher, knowing that the playing atmosphere of Denver's audience might be the highest level of water for any point I've faced this year.
"Why would I want to go to that game?"
The Nationals also failed to announce Sunday's first pitcher, but they are said to be inclined to ask Shelze to pitch in this situation.

Trump has a rally in West Virginia.
When the President spoke about the importance of the Republican turnout in the mid-term election, he referred to the situation of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
"All we've done will be threatened in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is very, very important -- I'm not running, but I'm running here, so I fight everywhere for the best candidate," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this very, terrible Democrat radical group, and you see it happening right here.
They're determined to take back power by any means necessary, and you see the mean, nasty behavior.
They don't care if they hurt the side, they don't care if they have to run over the side to gain power and control, which is what they want, and we don't give it to them. "
He said the Democrats' mission was to "resist and block."
He said, "In the last four days, you can see that," and called the Democrats "anger, mean, dirty, hypocritical."

The Labour Party is no longer an extensive church.
It can't tolerate people who say their thoughts.
It's not surprising when my "motivators" within the local party vote against me.
After all, in a group of Labour MPs, I'm the last person to be told that I'm unpopular -- all because we're saying our ideas.
My co-congress, Joan Lane, was treated similarly because he was determined to come out against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the accusation criticizes me for not agreeing with Jeremy Colbin's point of view.
In terms of the importance of responsible economic policies, in terms of national security, in Europe, there is the irony that, on similar issues, Jeremy does not agree with previous leaders.
"We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive," as the announcement of the Eastern Nottingham Labour Party meeting on Friday stated.
In the eight years I've been a member of the local Labour Party, this is what happened at the GC meeting on Friday night.
The sad thing is, today, it's not the tone of a lot of meetings, and the political promise of "more friendly, gentler" has long been forgotten, if it's really what it started.
It's becoming more obvious that the difference of opinion is not tolerated within the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged by whether it is accepted by the party's leadership.
The situation began with little time after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with similar political views as I thought before began to expect me to make a 180-degree transition, taking a stand I would not have agreed to - whether it was in the EU single market for national security.
Every time I make a public statement -- and I don't really mean anything -- there's a whirlwind in social media calling for the cancellation of the election, blaming middle-ranking politics, and saying I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because a review of me is often political.
I am very awe of the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face gender-based discrimination or racist insults every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the political era, the extent of the damage has been normalized.
Jeremy Colbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, we don't have a broad church anymore, and with every change in the "no-confidence" motion or choice rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I've got a lot of advice, and I've been urged to keep my head down, don't speak so loud, and then I'll be "nothing."
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Thirty-two years ago, I was still a junior student, and because of the Zachil administration's neglect, the classroom of my conciliate school collapsed, and since I joined the Labour Party, I've been trying to get better public services for those most in need – either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I would never hide my political position, including in this last election.
In the Eastern District of Nottingham, no one will have any doubts about my policy stance and differences with the current leadership.
I just wanted to say, for those who pushed the motion on Friday, that when the country was trying to get out of Europe, it would damage families, businesses and public services, there was no way I understood the point of wasting time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But in fact, one of the messages I'm going to convey is not for Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to be able to serve you, and I promise that whatever kind of withdrawal threat or political expediency is won't stop me from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Al 38-17 Melrose: Undefeated Alden.
The two subsequent attempts may prejudice the final result, but there is no doubt that Al is worthy of victory in this wonderful and interesting Tenant Super League.
They're at the top of the list. They're the only ten undefeated team.
In the end, their excellent defenses, and their better chances of taking advantage of it, allow the team to win, and coach Peter Much has the right to be happy.
"So far, we've been tested in the game, and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.

"The ocean is ours": Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors are on a naval patrol in La Paz, which covers the ropes.
The upper edge of the public building holds up a sea blue flag.
From Lake Kaka to the naval base in Amazon, the slogan "The ocean is legally ours.
Recovery is the responsibility. "
The desire of Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, to sail in the Pacific Ocean again, is as if they lost the coast line to the memory of Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict over resources.
That hope may have reached its highest level in decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a decision to be taken by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of trial.
A Bolivian diplomat, Robert Calsadi, said: "The spirit of Bolivia's conflict, its unity, its tolerance, of course, is a positive expectation of a tight outcome."
There will be a lot of Bolivians in the country watching the decisions of the International Court of Justice through the big screen, hoping that the International Arbitration Tribunal in The Hague will support Bolivia's claims — after decades of continuous talks — that Chile has the duty to negotiate the approval of a competent exit from the sea in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, has to face a controversial election war in the coming year, which also has a lot to rely on for Monday's decision.
At the end of August, she vowed, "We'll be back in the Pacific."
But some analysts think that the court will not make a decision that will benefit Bolivia, and that it will not change anything.
This United Nations agency, located in the Netherlands, has no authority to rule on Chile's territory, and it all rules that it will not influence the outcome of a possible conversation.
A Chilean expert in international law, Paz Zarate, said that a decision was made only six months after the final debate had been heard by an international court, stating that the situation was "not complicated."
In the last four years, not only have we not been able to advance to Bolivia's national budget, but it may have been a hindrance to the plan.
The Zárate: "This problem in China is for the current Bolivian government to kidnap."
He believes that Morales' provocative rhetoric has gradually wiped out all the goodwill left of the Chileans.
In some time Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the discussion afterwards.
Since 1962, neither country has sent diplomats to each other.
The representative of Bolivia at the Hague Tribunal, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Belsa, did not applaud the fact that the Tribunal was making its decisions at an unusually fast pace.
On Monday, he said, "a very rare opportunity for Bolivia to open up a new century of relations with Chile, "the same opportunity to bury a dispute that ends in a common interest and ends in 139 years."
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . which is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America has also denied that Morales was politically dependent on tight maritime issues.

Korea claims that unless the United States can gain their trust, nuclear weapons will not happen.
Korea's foreign minister, Li Yong-ho, said if his country didn't trust D.C., they wouldn't be able to eliminate nuclear weapons first.
Lee spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The reason for this statement is that three months after the United States Secretary of State Pompeyo met Kim Jong-un in Singapore with the Koreans, he seems to be re-enacting nuclear diplomacy in a stalemate.
According to Lee, it would be "a delusion" to think that the continuation of sanctions and the refusal of the United States to claim that the end of the Korean war would make the Democratic People's Republic of Korea submit.
The United States is cautious about agreeing to a statement that Pyongyang has not made a clear disarmament operation before it does.
Kim and the United States, President Donald Trump both wanted a second summit.
But it seems that this country in Korea is using nuclear weapons as the only way to ensure its own safety, and there is widespread doubt that it will seriously deal with the abandonment of nuclear weapons.
Pompeyo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second Kingt Peak.
The latest trend in Paris's fashion display of giant hats is about to be marketed at the mall next to you.
If you want to expand the scope of your hat, or to completely block the sun, then don't look so much more.
The designer, Valentino and Tom Brown, introduced a large number of super-sized caps for their SS19 series on stage T, making the trending scenes of the Paris Fashion Week look great.
This summer's unreal hat sweeps Ins, and the designer sends their snorkeling creations to T-stage.
The prominent work of Valentino is the glorified yellow hat, embellished by the feathers and decorated on the head of the model.
Other supersize ornaments include melons decorated with jewels, a witch hat or even a pineapple -- but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown has also shown the weird mask series, and it's so fast that it's going to be Halloween.
Many of these five-colored masks are sewn on their lips, like Hannibal Lecter's more than a stylish high fashion.
There's one piece of water pulmonary diving equipment that looks like it's carrying a diving respiratory tube with a diving lens, and another one that looks like a melted ice cream cylinder.
And if you keep looking at this giant fashion report - you're lucky.
Tide observers predict that the large edgeless hats are struggling to get the mall next to you on the market.
This supersize hat boom is a two-foot-wide straw hat brought by La Bomba, from Rehana to Emily Ratakovsky, with one hand.
The current fashion label, which represents a far less realistic capping on the social media screen, has sent the other big one to T-stage — a model that is almost as big as the one that's keeping the swimsuit in place to drag down the grass-making beach bags.
The most prominent work of Jacquemus in the La RivieraSS19 series of the Paris Fashion Week is an orange-corrupted palm-leaved platinum-leaved bag with palm-leaved platinum, which flows to the side of the soothing, and a white leather handcarving at the top.
The fashionable Luke Armitage, along with "FEMAIL", said, "I look forward to seeing the big hat and beach bags on the street in the summer of the year -- because the impact of the designers is so great that the hard words ignore the demand for super-large ornaments."
John Edward: Language skills that matter to the citizens of the world.
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this record, based on another excellent examination, which continued in 2018, is based only on the efforts of the individual co-groups in sports, art, music, and other groups.
The schools are represented by the Scottish Independent School Board (SCIS) and are dedicated to providing services of the highest standard to their parents and students throughout Scotland.
The goal of independent schools is to help students adapt to a longer and higher level of education, the activities they choose and the positioning they will become citizens of the world.
As an education department that can design a customized school curriculum for the same purpose, we believe that modern language is still a popular and needed course option in the school.
Nelson Mandela: "If you talk to him in a language you understand, the content of the conversation will be in his mind.
If you talk to him in his language, the content of the conversation touches his mind. "
This is a powerful reminder that when we want to build relationships and trust with people in other countries, we can't rely on English.
From the results of this year's most recent examinations, the highest rate of language adoption in independent schools is on the ranking list.
Sixty-eight percent of students studying foreign languages have attained higher level A.
Data collected from the 74 member schools of the SCIS show that 72 per cent of students achieve higher level A in Chinese subjects, while 72 per cent of students in German, 69 per cent of students in French and 63 per cent of students in Spanish have the same level A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland use foreign languages as important skills that children and adolescents will need to support in the future.
. Language as a subject of science is chosen to receive the same weight as other aspects of STEM courses (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools.
The 2014 survey by the British Commission on Industry and Skills found that 17 per cent of the reasons for the difficulties in filling vacancies identified by the managing director were due to a lack of language skills.
So, to prepare young people for their future careers, language skills are becoming more important.
With more promising work opportunities requiring multiple languages, skills are important in a globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he or she can learn a second language, he or she will benefit in the future by acquiring the skills that accompany him or her throughout his or her life.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to a 2013 poll conducted by YouGov against over 4,000 British adults, seventy-five per cent were unable to communicate in foreign languages, and French was the only language to use more than two digits, reaching 15 per cent.
That's why it's important to invest in language teaching for children today.
In the developing economy in particular, access to multiple languages can give children better opportunities to stabilize more valuable jobs.
In Scotland, each school teaches a different language.
Some schools will be oriented towards more traditional and modern languages, while others will teach some languages that are considered to be most important to the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your children, there are many languages to choose in independent schools, with specialists in the appropriate fields as teaching staff.
The independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing children with a learning environment that will help them adapt to the skills they need to be able to succeed, regardless of what will happen in the future.
There is no denying that, in this era, a globalized business environment, language remains very important for the future of a country, so this must be reflected in education.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence in the achievements of the young generation of Scotland.
It has to be done.

LeBron started his first appearance in the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The fans who wanted to see LeBron play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time finally came to the table.
The Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James would play in the preseason unveiling event on Sunday in San Diego, against the Denver gold diggers.
But it's not decided how many minutes he'll play.
Walton spoke online to the Lakers: "It's going to take more than a minute to get there than 48 minutes."
The number of minutes in which Lakers reporter Mike Trudell may make a tweet about James is limited.
In the training that took place earlier this week, James asked about his plans to play for the Lakers' six preseason schedule.

What time is Trump's campaign in West Virginia tonight?
Trump's campaign rally in Welling City, West Virginia is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. in Eastern United States time.
You can watch the following Trump campaign rally in West Virginia online via live YouTube.

But the primary objective of this highly popular campaign is to help the forthcoming November elections of the Republican Party.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign team therefore called the next week's five campaign rally as "an effort to inspire the morale of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to secure the same increase in the majority of seats in the same House of Representatives."
One speaker in the Trump campaign who did not wish to reveal his name revealed to Reuters, "We have entered a busy campaign period, and the control of Congress is very important in the President's plan, and he is going to as many states as possible."
According to West Virginia Metro News, the campaign rally planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Stadium in Welling City will have media coverage from Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as Pittsburgh.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, where she won over 40% of the support rate in 2016.
. . . . . . . Trump is trying to help the fallen Republican Senator candidate Patrick Morrisi in the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political scientist in West Virginia, said that "the President is trying to help her in the polls, and this is not a good signal for Morrisi. "
The US team is able to keep hope and show their determination to compete on Sunday's singles.
After three single-side races, the four-man race next Saturday may already be needed for this Ryder Cup.
The bell-playing force can be entirely a fictional concept of sports, but the athletes really agree with this statement, especially in this game, which is an unprecedented belief.
So where are they supposed to be?
When Jordan Spith walked away from the scene, he said, "They were six points ahead, and the family was four, so I think there's less of a situation on our side."
Europe, of course, is an advantage. It's led by four points, and over twelve are in a tight race.
But, as Spith said, the American team felt that the situation was in their favour, because there was a lot of confidence in them, with Spith playing with Justin Thomas all day, and everyone had three points in four.
Spith's always been on the golf course. It's an excellent model.
When it came to Spears, he tied the game to four points with a key push-in, and the cheers around him were even louder, after two consecutive errors with Thomas.
At the time of the 15th hole, their push-in goal earned them the same cheers, so you know that they believe the American team is still out of the game.
And Spith said, "You really have to do your best to keep your eye on the game."
It's the same thing that concerns all athletes in the family.
It's an extraordinary 18-hole.
In the last two days, the only team of athletes who scored more than Spith and Thomas were Francisco Morinelli and Tommy Frettwood, the legends of the Leeds Cup.
Europe's weird and cute combination, four-game win, never making a mistake.
Either way, the second half of the day of Friday, the next day of Friday is Saturday, and "Morriwood" is the only group that didn't hit a hit.
In a round of performance, their energy flowed to the popular audience, and they were athletes who had won on Sunday, and when the sun was shining at the National Golf Club, there were no other stars other than Frettwood and Morinery who could have won that game, which might have belonged to Europe.
It's better to synchronize the two on the number of holes that don't match.
Although it's still too early to say the glory of Europe.
Barba Watson and Weber Simpson made a clean run against Alexander Noren and Sergio Garcia, who are the heroes of the four games in the present day.
One hit in the first half and two break orders to the Spaniards and the Swede fell a little bit, and it was so hard to climb back out.
It's Sunday, but there's no one to help you crawl out of here.
The four-ball match with the four-man match was very good, because of the interaction between the combinations, the suggestions they had made, the strategies they had to change, and the strategies they had to look at.
So far, Europe has seen better as a team, entering the final day of the game with obvious advantages, but the American team in the four-player period has similarly demonstrated their ambitions for the game, although some, especially within the United States, had previously held a skeptical attitude.

Inspired by the fact that with the partner, Tommy Frettwood and Francesco Morinery won two victories, Tiger Woods, who struggled, pulled their score to four points at the National Golf Club.
The European team's Thomas Bjørn side, intended to take back the trophy that was missed in Hazeltine two years ago, won the silent American team 3-1 in the four games of the present day.

But they're both second in line, and Sunday's counterattack seems to be a long way off.
Korea claims that there is absolutely no way to disarm the weapon without trust.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of Korea informed the United Nations that the continued sanctions were deepening South Korea's distrust of the United States, and that, in such circumstances, there was no possibility that North Korea would abandon nuclear weapons alone.
The U.N. General Assembly has been informed by Li Young-ho that in the past year, Korea has taken well-meaning actions, such as stopping nuclear testing and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites and promising that nuclear weapons and technology will not surge.
He said, "But we haven't seen any response from the American side."
"If we don't have any trust in the United States, we don't have any confidence in the security of our country, and in this case we don't have the possibility of starting unilaterally to disarm ourselves. "
Li repeats his dissatisfaction with the practice of D.C., which has gradually become denuclearized and should be commended, but which has turned a blind eye to the progress of this "stage" and whose rhetoric is more evocative than that of Pyongyang's long-standing approach to rejecting the elimination of nuclear weapons alone.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
South Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but it is the United States that must abandon nuclear weapons first on the Pyongyang side.
The D.C. has also resisted calls to ease the imposition of harsh international sanctions on Korea.
Li called it: "The United States has always insisted on ‘nuclearization first' and has achieved their purpose by increasing sanctions, even rejecting the ‘war end statement'."
"Thought that sanctions would make us submit to the delusions of people we don't know.
But the problem is that the sanctions continue to deepen our mistrust.
Lee did not mention any plans for the second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, which was emphasized by American leaders in the United Nations this week.
Instead, the Foreign Minister emphasized the three meetings between Kim and Korean leaders over the past five months, which he added: " If the issue of denuclearization was involving Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be deadlocked. "
Even so, Lee's argument that there was a great difference between the old years and the old years, when he was in the United Nations General Assembly, after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket" in a suicide mission, it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets aimed at the U.S. mainland.
In the old years, Trump, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, highly praised the courage of the United Nations this year to take action to disarm, but said that much remained to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until the denuclearization of South Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this, saying, "Two years, three years, or five months - no problem."
China and Russia argued that the United Nations Security Council should recognize the actions taken by Pyongyang.
But, in the United States, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that " the sanctions imposed by the Security Council must continue to be enforced and should not go wrong until we have fully and conclusively confirmed that they have been denuclearized."
In 2006, the Security Council began implementing sanctions against Korea in a concerted manner, with the aim of cutting off the funding of the Pyongyang nuclear program and the ballistic missile program.
Pompeyo met with Lee at the United Nations General Assembly venue and said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited Korea three times this year, but it's not going well for her last trip.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he claimed that progress had been made, but instead, Joseon condemned him for making "a hooligan-like demand" in hours.
The Korean side promised at the same meeting this month that if the United States took "responsible measures", it would dismantle a missile field with the same nuclear complex.
He claimed Kim had previously informed her that Kim's quest for "responsible measures" was a security guarantee previously promised by Trump in Singapore and a move to normalize relations with D.C.
Harvard students are taking lessons about getting enough rest.
A new course this year at Harvard University has taught all of its undergraduates a lot to fight the tougher culture of caffeine-based energy for "dam all night" learning.
There are academic findings that students in the world's first-ranked universities are often ignorant of the most basic commons of taking care of themselves.
The professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, Charles Czeisler, a doctor specializing in Breagan Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first course of its kind in the United States.
It was inspired by a lecture about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the lecture was over, a schoolgirl came over and told me, 'Why did I get to know when I was 4 years old?
He never said anything about the importance of sleep — I'm very surprised. "He told the Daily Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, shows students that good sleep practices enhance their physical quality and also help them to study the quality of the performance of the same movement.
- Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Harvard University Health Center, claims that the school decided to launch this course after it found that students had a severe lack of sleep from Monday to Friday.
The course is one clock long and includes a series of interactive missions.
One of the rings is a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, and sports shoes, and will know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deficiency on exercise performance, and the importance of disciplined timing.
In another ring, participants were told that long-term sleep deprivation was a way to increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive graphs encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
"We know this one doesn't change student behavior immediately.
But we think they have a right to know -- it's like you have a right to know what the health impact is if you choose to smoke. "Professor Czeisler adds.
The culture in which he is proud of "night and night" still exists, adding that the constant increase in pressure on students by modern technology means that the problem of sleep deprivation is getting worse.
He said that ensuring sufficient quality sleep can become a "secret weapon" for students to resist stress, fatigue and anxiety - even to avoid obesity, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to enter extreme hunger patterns, making them feel hungry.
The 19-year-old Raymond Suuen University, who studied chemical physics, took a course in his first year, before designing the course for him.
He said that the course opened her eyes and inspired her to promote the course into a school-wide course.
Next, he wanted all undergraduates to complete a similar study program before entering a competitive institute.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students consider setting alarm clocks to wake up, while being careful of the dangers of "blue light" that spreads out of electronic screens and LEDs, which can cause your biological period to become disordered, causing sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1-0 vagrants: Ming joins the ball and beats Gerald's team.
Dolly Minga's foot shot Stephen Gerard's team at 1-0 in Livingston, and the vagrants experienced an unstated sadness.
In February, after a 4-1 victory in St. Johnston, Eblocks tried to record their first victory on the road, but Gary Holt's team hit Gerard's second defeat in 18 games, successfully placing his team behind Hatz's unstoppable British Super League leader.
The Minga scored seven minutes before the end of the half-time, and the vagrants lacked morale, not even on the same level.

Moreover, there may be more troubles for vagrants, and it is clear that the object that caused this wound was passed over by the visitors because of the need for medical treatment for the head injury.
Gerard made eight changes to the team formation that swept Al United into the semi-finals of the League Cup.
On the other side, Holt went on to keep Livingston 11's line, which had won one point last week, and his team, which was well-trained, could strangulate the opponent and should make him happy.

The vagrants do control the situation, but they seem to want more than faith in their performance in the forbidden zone.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, thought that there should be a penalty ball at the time of the fifteenth minute, when he collided with Stephen Lawlis, but the referee Stephen Thomson rejected the claim of this Colombian player.
In the first half, vagrants struggled to get a chance to shoot the right target twice, but little trouble was caused to Eblocks' former goalkeeper, Liam Corey, when Lasana Curibana's head ball and Ovi Eyaria's flat shot.
Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute seemed surprising, but, thanks to their efforts, no one could deny that they were worth it.
The vagrants once again missed Jakobs' remote location for the attack.

But Livingston went on to hang the guest team in the way they wanted to, and Resco scanned one long story after another with Harcott.
The Holt side could have taken their lead in the final stages, but McGlege kept it steady and turned Jakobs out of the room before the Riggor Point ball failed.

The inventor of the Gaeger Calculator.
The following is a page of our Sunday Morning Herald statistics: Today, 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, time has increased steadily... and the future physicist Johannis Wilheim "Hans" Gaeger was born in Germany.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . Geiger invented the method of detecting the same amount of ionizing radiation, and this method eventually produced an instrument called the Geiger Count.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a popular culture mainstream, not only in the scientific world, but also in the 1950 film Colorado's Bell, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans decorated a few of the similar cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is all this?"
. . . . . Rogers: "Geiger counters, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as beryllium.
Put this headphone on so you can hear the atomic sound of mineral electrophoresis. "
Ivans: "My word, and my family must be here to jump!"
Hans Gaeger died a few days before her 63rd birthday in 1945.
But this invention, named after him, has been circulating to this day.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to look at the malign cell and eliminate it.
The vaccine immune system identifies malignant cells as one of the rings in which treatment takes place.

They can "see" the proteins that are common in a lot of cancer and then inject them into the patient.
The test vaccine shows positive results in a number of cancer patients.
A woman who has received vaccine treatment from the immune system to identify malignant cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, adapting them in the laboratory so that they can "see" one of the proteins commonly found in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting them into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States of America in Bethesda, Maryland, said, " Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine. "
Professor Berzofsky explained that Her2 "will promote the growth of several types of cancers", including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and coitus cancer.
Immunocellular cells are extracted from patients, and immunocellular cells are tested for cancer cells, a similar operation that has been applied to the treatment of a leukemia.

<seg id = "8" > Although West's angry footage did not air the street, it was comedian Chris Locke who uploaded the footage to social media.
I don't know if Locke wants to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that he was unhappy because of his head ornament.
According to the Washington Examiner, they said, "They're in the back shrimp.
They said, "Don't go out with the top hat."
They're me!
Then they say I'm in a sinking zone. "
West went on, "You want to see the sinking zone?" and said, "I'm wearing my Superman cloak, because that means I don't want you to tell me how to do it.
"Try to use the la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
His remarks led to at least two appearances of silhouettes from the audience, and the performers of Saturday Night's Present were embarrassed, and "the stage" was reported on the scene: "A studio has fallen into a deadness. "
West was late to invite to replace singer Elena Grande, whose ex-boyfriend died a few days earlier.
Wester's performance song "I Love It" was dressed like a Parisian pot of water, making many people wonder.
"To the bravest soul: Thank you for fighting against the united people. "
However, talk show host Karen Hunt tweeted West "is just doing her own good."
"But I will never choose to award a prize (by buying his musical co-designs or supporting his 'art'), and I think that what I support in the same mouth is a toxic idea to my community.
It's free.
We all are. "He added.

One of the rappers, Snoopy doggy, used the name Snoopy Lion, and, of course, the late music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol, then to the familiar artist prince.

HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14 per cent surge in newly diagnosed cases.
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in my country.
It was only in the second quarter of 2018 that about 40,000 new cases were revealed for confirmed cases.
The majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, indicating the changes that have taken place before.
In the traditional sense, the HIV virus rapidly spreads through the input of infected blood to parts of China.
At a meeting in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials spoke that the number of people infected with the HIV virus in this way had decreased to almost zero.
In comparison, however, the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The problem of spreading the HIV virus through sexual behavior is very serious in the LGBT community in China.
The Chinese gays were legalized in 1997, but heard of widespread social discrimination against LGBT groups.
My country's traditional views are conservative, and the study estimates that 70-90% of gay men eventually choose to marry a woman.
There is insufficient sexual protection in the transmission of many diseases in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has accepted the promotion of access to HIV medication as part of a major effort to address the problem.

The U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters accused a member of her staff on Saturday of sending the personal data of three U.S. Republican Senators to the lawmakers' Wikipedia web page.
L.A. Democrats say that the rumor is that the "extreme right" expert and buried the site.
And Waters was tweeting, saying, "To speak big, to speak big, and to have more annoying lies."
According to the report, the data published included the same phone number as the address of the American Senator Lindsay-Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Olin Hatch of Utah.
On Thursday, a stranger from Mount Congress posted a leak on the website, during which a Senate small hearing was held on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Three senators questioned Cavanaugh about the leak.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the Congress Hills report that "Gateway Pundit" is associated with conservative media reports such as "RedState" that the IP address of the identity post's source is related to Waters' office, and reveals a working person data from Waters.
"This is a false accusation. It's definitely a false accusation. "Watters continues.
"My staff, whose identity, personal data and safety have been affected by the charges of fraud and fraud, have nothing to do with the disclosure of the data.
All these allegations are false, they're false. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This attitude is outraged, "Frecher's word.
"It's obvious that he doesn't have the privilege of a member of Parliament.
I'm sorry I've been wronged for something I haven't done.
We can't pick them.
They can't question the motives of the accusers.
They have to be calm and peaceful. "
Fletcher seems to be comparing Waters' reaction with Democrats' impeachment of Judge Cavanaugh, who seems to have been too angry with Cavanaugh during the Thursday hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who ran for the midterm election to get Waters off the stage, also tweeted his voice.
"If it's true, it's a big deal," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had issued a warning that "the agency and the law enforcement organization would pay attention to the fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be prosecuted, that they will be held accountable for their actions against any or all of our workers. "
Agent Bean 3 review – Funny rookie agent played by Rowan Eckinson.
From a traditional perspective, it is now any new film that seeks a preference for Britain's de-European meaning, which seems to be suitable for the re-activation of the comedy-action funny series of films, Agent Bean, which began to be released in 2003, and Agent Bean 2, who returned with a smile in 2011.
The content of the self-satisfaction that focuses on nonsense can be re-received by the audience?
How about the wheel, for the second time in a row, Special Agent Bean 2 was issued with a licence, Mr. Bean staring at his eyes, with a rich face, and an unbroken, clumsy and cute journey, whose name was much more extensive than that of a comic book designed by a non-English-speaking viewer.
He was, of course, the fool's secret agent, despite the strange sense of humor that he displayed, and the taste of something like Clouseau, Mr. Shoes, was much less and the 2012 London Olympic Opening was the one whose theme song band hit a sound.
He was born in Eikinson, a traveler who had once been forgotten about Barclay's credit card television ad, and buried an international mystery man, and was in such a mess in seven countries since he woke up.
One or two of the most recent JE exits.
I meant Johnny Ingley to wear a set of medieval armor near the helicopter, and the rotor wing to be buried in a short collision with his helmet.

This sense of humor seems to fit a lot of the trail, and it's good for the offspring. For me, it's not the novelty and sensibilities of the Ulong that Johnny Ingle laughs at everything.
The premise of the current hot topic is that the UK is in big trouble.
A web hacker hacked into the British super-secret spy network and made public the identity of all British field agents, which surprised the duty agents – the under-representation of Kevin Elden was weak and powerless to remedy the situation.
To the Prime Minister, who is proud and has fallen into a four-sided Chugo, this is the last straw, and the loss of politics will bring it to a complete collapse: Emma Thompson struggles to return the character to the role of pro-Tresa May, but there is nothing in the script that can be used to power it.
His intelligence advisor told him that all the active agents had been exposed and that he had to take a retired agent as a partner.
This means that Johnny Ingly himself, a teacher at some noble school, offers informal lessons on how to become an undercover agent: this means that Igley has added a laugh because of a "rock academy"-like spy class.
Ingley came back to the White Hall for the emergency briefing and reunited with her former follow-on, Banboy (played again by Ben Miller).
The Boyds are married men, married to the same submarine captain, a very interesting character, and there's nothing that Vicky Pepperdale can do about it.
So, in the "Queen's Secrets of 007", Batman and Robin, who screwed things up again, met O'Fellia Brotova, the beautiful female killer played by Olga Corranco.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is in danger of falling into the grip of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to handle a computer failure in the United Kingdom: the evil one (Jack Lacey plays) Jason Waltera.

It's the last ring of effort, but the whole process is full of joy and addiction, but there's still a smell of children's television.
It's a pretty touching piece.
Like other Bean Agents films, I can't help but think: can the British film world fail to give Rowan Elkinson a role that really holds his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to receive five days' pay.
. . . . . . . . . . . . Jeremy Colbin Labour Party considered an aggressive project that allowed the British to work four days a week, but received a five-day salary.
It was reported that the Labour Party hoped that the company's boss would pay the workers through the money from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to give them an extra day's rest.
I expect employees to enjoy the weekend of the three-day break of the week – but still have the same money to go home.

A Labour senior said that the Sunday Times knew: ‘The expected results of the policy review were announced by the end of the year.
‘The plan will not be implemented immediately, but a four-day work week is a wish that is in line with the Labour Party’s approach to rebalancing the economy that benefits workers and with the Labour Party’s overall industrial strategy.’
The Labour Party was not the first party to support this idea, and the Green Party was supposed to undertake a one-week, four-day working week in the 2017 general election.
However, it should be hoped that the Labour Party will not be recognized as a whole at this time.
One of the Labour Party speakers said, "It's not party policy to work on Thursdays a week, and the party has not considered the issue. "
The Shadow Cabinet Minister, John MacDonald, used last week's Labour Conference to portray his aspirations for an economic and socialist revolution.
Mr. MacDonald said that he was determined to take back the power of the "anonymous director" and "stealer" of the public sector company.
The shadow cabinet minister's plan responded that the current shareholders of the water company might not be able to take over all of their shares, as the Labour government might "retain" the shares due to perceived misconduct.

Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy say in "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Cavanaugh will change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court's nomination of a final vote to be postponed for at least a week, and the question whether the results of the investigation by the authorities affected any Republican senators to withdraw their support for him.
In the interview that aired on Sunday, the 60 Minutes show's reporter Scott Peley asked Republican Senator Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy if the FBI could find any clues that would change their minds.
Gandy seems to be more open than her colleagues from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy.
"At the hearing, I said, I've spoken to Judge Cavanaugh.
When this happened, the charges came to light, and I called her, "Have you done anything?"
He was determined, determined, and disproved. "
However, Graham's vote seems to have stayed the same.
He said, "I've made up my mind about Brett Cavanaugh, which requires an explosive charge."
Professor Ford, I know what's going on, but I've learned that Brett strongly denies, "Graham adds, referring to Christine Blessey Ford.
"Everyone he mentioned has no way of confirming this.
It's 36 years old.
I didn't find any new evidence. "
What's Global Citizen's Day? What does this have to do with poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the New York Date is hosting the annual Musical Festival of Global Citizens, a multi-star show that shakes the whole scene, doing its part for the mission of the public good; and eliminating world poverty.
In the seventh edition of the Global Civic Festival, tens of thousands of people went to the big lawns of Central Park to see the performances of Jenny Jackson, Cady B and Sean Mundez, among others, and held events aimed at making people aware of the importance of the goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Civic Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization that aims to increase the number of people actively involved in anti-poverty activities to eradicate poverty.
In order to get free tickets to the concert (unless you are willing to pay VIP tickets), regular concert audiences must perform a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteer services, emails to world leaders, phone calls or any other meaningful way to increase common understanding of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But the goal is 12 years away, and how successful can global citizens be?
Is it true that people who call for action in a way that provides free concerts, or just another kind of "network click action" — by signing online petitions or tweeting about the call for action — make people think that their actions are meaningful?
In Global Citizen, since 2011, it has documented over 19 million supporters' "actions", pushing many different targets.
Global Citizen said that action prompted world leaders to declare a commitment of more than $37 billion to a policy that would affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
c) In early 2018, the organization issued 390 pledges from its operations, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or raised.
The organization estimates that the funds received so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the important commitments include The Power of Nutrition (a cooperative venture based in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland between investors and implementers) to "help children develop their full potential" and, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world, to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate the country's poor nutritional situation.
"With the support of the British government, donors, governments and global citizens like you, we can make poor social inequalities a small historical episode," said Ambassador Tracy Elman of Nutrition in April 2018 at the London live concert.
The organization also claimed that after taking more than 5,000 initiatives to call on the United Kingdom to improve the situation of mothers and children, the Government announced the allocation of funds to a project of the Power of Nutritio, which would provide support to 5 million women and children.
"Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global citizen echoes: "It's gonna be a long and hard road – sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like our great civil rights movement before us and our anti-racist isolation movement, we will succeed because we will be stronger together.

The U.S. Secretary of State for the Interior claimed that the Navy could be used to "block" Russia and block its energy exports.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . according to the Washington Observer's report, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zink declared that "if necessary" Washington could use the Navy to stop Russian energy and hit the Middle East market.
Zinke declared that Russia's involvement in Syria, particularly at the invitation of the legitimate government, was a pretext for the development of a new energy market in Russia.
According to the report, "I think the reason why they're left in the Middle East is because they just want to be in the middle of energy, as they do in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe."
And, according to this official, there's a lot of ways to deal with the problem with the means of burial.
He said, "The United States has the ability, through our navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blocked and that their energy resources are not accessible to the market."

For this reason, officials of the Trump administration, including United States President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" North Creek 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump's report, made Berlin the "capture" of Moscow.
In Moscow, it has been stressed on several occasions that the $11 billion North Creek 2 pipeline project is a purely economic project that will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres.
The Kremlin argued that Washington was out of economic interest alone and was fiercely opposed to the project, making it a case of unfair competition.
Russian energy minister Alexander Novak met with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September after he said, "I believe we all recognize that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure, and consumers should be able to choose suppliers."
The position of the United States led to strong German resistance, and Germany reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organization in Germany, the German Industrial Union (BDI), called on the United States to stay away from the European Union's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Burial Berlin and Moscow.
The President of the German Industrial Union (BDI), Dieter Kempf, met Russian President Vladimirovich Putin in the aftermath of a recent meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimirovich Putin: "When the third country interfered in our energy supply, I was in great trouble."

Sarah Palin was mentioned at Donald Trump's rally about Chuck Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder.
Chuck Palin, 26, served in Iraq for a year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged on Monday night for domestic violence.
In the city of Tarsa, Oklahoma, she spoke to the audience about the rally that supported Donald Trump: "Thinking about the species that my own son is going through, the species he's going through when he comes back, I can understand how other families feel about post-traumatic stress disorder, and some of the injuries that our soldiers have suffered after they returned."
In Perrin's words, his arrest was "sacked" and he referred to his son's words for a while with other veterans: "They came back a little different, became strong, and wondered if their comrades, pilots and every other soldier had been respected for what they had done for the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasilla police station, she was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and was prosecuted for domestic violence attacks on women, interfering with domestic violence reports and drunken possession of guns.
The 18 states, along with Washington, D.C., support the challenge of a new policy of asylum.
The 18 states, along with the Colombian region, supported the prosecution of a new policy in the United States, which in turn provided shelter to victims of gang or domestic violence.
According to the NBC News Report, representatives of the 18 co-states filed an amicus curiae petition in Washington, D.C. on Friday to support asylum seekers in filing legal suits.
The Sysings lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not yet been disclosed.
She said her companion, "with his violent gang son", abused her, but the American officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
He's in custody in Texas.
According to state lawyers who supported Grace, Salvado, Honduras and Guatemala have a large number of applicants for asylum in the United States because the country faces widespread problems such as the threat of gang violence and domestic violence.
The U.S. New Asylum Policy overturned a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission to allow illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . the Colombian District Justice Department, Carl Racine, is a statement in the middle of the week, and the new policy is "states that have been blind for decades, federal and international law."
"The federal law provides that all asylum applications are decided on the basis of the particular facts of the claim, and that this type of prohibition violates the principle," the amicus curiae petition.
In his appeal, counsel further argued that the policy of refusing immigration had damaged the American economy, saying that they were more likely to be business associates "to provide the necessary labor force."
In June of recent years, Justice Minister Jeff Sysings has ordered immigration judges to provide additional shelter to victims of gang violence fleeing domestic abuse.
On June 11th, Sysings proclaimed this policy: "The following categories of people can be granted asylum: from race, religion, nationality, or belonging to a particular social group, or from people who have been persecuted or feared of holding a certain political opinion. "
The asylum has always been designed to alleviate all the problems and even all the serious problems that citizens of the world face every day.
As the number of dead doubled, the rescuers were Palou City fighting to try and rescue the survivors.
For survivors, the situation is getting more and more critical.
"It's very tense," said Lisa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is the evacuation center in Palou City, in the disaster area, comforting her feverish baby talk.

They saw the residents returning to their destroyed homes, looking for them from the immersion, trying to find anything they could find.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused hundreds of injuries and the number of hospital admissions to climb, leaving the hospital overburdened.
Some of the injuries to the back and shoulder fractures, such as Dwi Haris, were outside the Palou Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to the persistence of strong aftershocks.
It was full of tears, and when the earthquake took place, she lived with his wife, daughter, in the guest room on the fifth floor of the hotel.
"We can't save ourselves.

"I heard my wife crying for help, and then I heard it.

I hope they're safe. "
The U.S. ambassador accused China's 'propagandistic advertising' of containing 'bullying' insinuations.
The official Chinese newspaper was a four-page advertisement published in the United States daily newspaper, selling Chinese-American trade for mutual benefit, and a week later, the United States Ambassador to China denounced the Beijing government for using the United States media for propaganda purposes.
The United States, after President Donald Trump accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 election to the United States Congress last Wednesday, referred to the fee-paying coverage published in the Daily China newspaper, the largest-selling newspaper in Iowa, which reported that China had rejected the allegation.
United States officials revealed to Reuters that Trump condemned Beijing's attempt to pre-empt the US election as a sign that Washington's campaign to press China for promotion into a new phase.
It's normal for foreign governments to launch commercials to promote trade. Beijing and Washington, D.C. Iowa are caught in an endless trade battle, and both have been subject to multiple rounds of customs taxes on each other's imports.
The Chinese and American experts said that China was an exporter of tax recovery in the early stages of the trade war, and that it was an attempt to hit countries such as Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party.
The former Governor of Iowa, Terry Branstad, said that the Beijing government had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses, and that Iowa was the main exporter of agricultural products to China.
Blanstad is the Sunday De Mein Chronicle where he says that China "is now trying to pay back our teeth by advertising in our own free media."
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . while preaching for a while, the Chinese government was using the tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, which America valued, to publish a paid advertisement in the Demain Chronicle.
He wrote, "On the contrary, since the Chinese press is under the strict control of the Communist Party of China, and at the newsstands on Beijing Street, you will find the opposition to be limited and will see any real reflection of Chinese disagreement with China's disturbing economic trajectory."
He went on to say, "One of China's most famous newspapers refuses to publish her articles," even though she doesn't say it's a family newspaper.
. . . . . . . . analysts warned that the Republicans had alienated female voters before the midterm election because of the Kavanaugh defeat.
The Supreme Court judge candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, faces a number of allegations of sexual abuse, and many Republican seniors are still defending him, with analysts warning that they will face strong resistance, especially from women, in the context of the mid-term election.
The mood surrounding this thing is very high, and most Republicans have shown that they are interested in taking a decision.
The political science professor at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell College, Grant Reeher, in an article published on Saturday, said to The Hills of Congress, "There's no way to pretend it didn't happen.
. . . . . . Reeher said that he suspected Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Frecker of being the last-minute strong request to the FBI to carry out an investigation that would be sufficient to appease the angry voters.
According to the Washington Post, Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the forward organization MoveOn, said on Friday: "The women will not forget what happened in recent days, they will forget what happened on the day of the hearing, and they will forget what happened in November."
Mic reports that on Friday morning, due to testimony from the Republicans who controlled the Justice Commission, Ford, chose to push forward with the nomination of Cavanaugh, and the protesters rebuffed the call "Come November!" in the Senate corridor.
. . . . . . . . . . . . no-party political analyst Stu Rosenberg revealed to the news site that "the enthusiasm and momentum of the Democrats will break the record.
"We've got a lot of turnout; it's true.
But the turnout may be higher, especially among the swinging female voters in the suburbs, who are the same young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite their interest in the presidency, generally vote. "
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidates, analysts showed that if Republicans pushed forward with the nomination confirmation, they could be strongly resisted.
According to the NBC news report, Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week: "That's a mess with the Republicans. "
"This matter has nothing to do with the Commission's vote or the final vote or the appointment of Cavanaugh, and with the way the Republicans deal with it, and with the way they deal with it," said Priorities USA chairman Guy Cecil, the organization that elected the Democrats.

YouGov's new poll showed that 41% of respondents were certain or might believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were or might believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent said that they thought that Cavanaugh might or must have said the same thing to Ford when testifying for a while, while only 30 per cent said the same thing to Ford.
The Guardian reports that, at the request of Frank, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford was sworn in by the Senate Judicial Committee last week, saying that the 17-year-old Cavanaugh had violated her for a while.
Ramirez claims that in the 1980s, when they were at a party during the Yale book period, this Supreme Court judge candidate exposed her genitals.

The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Burners-Lee Open Source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to select their data storage as edges, and allows visitors to access border information.
The idea behind Inrupt was to rule the world.
And so the start-up company said, "We have to do something about it. "
"This is the moment of history. "
This application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify can be used at the same time on a streamer.
The uniqueness of personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to users to have access to side information.
The company called it "the empowerment of individuals through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring in resources, processes and appropriate skills that will help everyone to use Solid.
The company is currently made up of Burners-Lee, Bruce (who has in the past established a secure platform that was bought by IBM), some of the job developers who signed up to work on the project, and volunteer code farming communities.
From this week onwards, technical developers around the world can use the tools available on the Inrupt website to create their own decentrified applications.
Bernards-Lee, he's not working with the team on "Facebook and Google" to introduce changes that will immediately completely reverse all their business patterns.
"We didn't ask for their consent. "
"The mission of Inrupt is to provide a commercial energy synonym system to protect the integrity and quality of the new network entrusted to Solid."
c) In 1994, Burners-Lee founded the Universal Web Alliance at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, changing the Internet.
In recent months, Burners-Lee has been influential in the debate about the neutrality of the Internet.
Even when the Inrupt was launched, Berners-Lee would still be the founder and director of the Universal Web Alliance, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
And Bernas-Lee added, "I'm very optimistic about the future era of the network.
Bernard Vann: First World War Victoria Cross Pastoral Celebration.
The only pastor of the Church of England who received the Victoria Cross as a warrior during the First World War was a home-grown celebration 100 years ago.
The award was awarded to Reverend Reverend Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Belangles and Le Okur.
. . . . . . . . . . . . four days later, however, it was snived by a sniper who never knew that he had received the highest military honour in England.
In a parade in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire, her two grandchildren unveiled a memorial on Saturday.
One of her grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the monument was her grandfather's award-winning heroism, which was revealed 100 years later, "extremely symbolically significant."
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . on 29 September 1918, Lt.-Colonel Vann led his camp "through the thick fog, risking the heavy advance of a field gun with a machine gun" through the Santa Quentin Canal.
He then rushed to the front, "dauntless" leading the team forward, and then knocked out the three men of the unit with a field gun alone.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, the month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's behavior was zero "I know something I can never do, but I'll keep humbled by it."
His brother, Dr. James Vann, also dedicated the wreath at the end of the parade, which was led by the Britwood Royal Youth Band.
Michael Vann said, "It's an honor to attend this parade" and added, "The gallantry of the real hero has earned him the support of many."
The MMA fans wanted to stay up the night, Bellator 206.
Imagine, you spent the whole night trying to see Bellator 206, and then you were told that IKEA saw the main event.
The ticket from St. Joseph included 13 games, six of which were on the main track and were broadcast live throughout the night on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6 a.m. last day, when Giggard Mossas and Rory MacDonald were preparing PK, the British audience was surprised, as the picture they saw turned into "Piggy Paige".
In particular, there are people who stay up all night to sleep in the morning to watch the game, so that's what this is all about.
A fan on Twitter, switched to the children's animated film is "some kind of prank."
The "Bellator" sales senior vice president Dave Schwartz was asked about the show's broadcast for a while: "Government rules, the content of the show played at 6 a.m. last day, so they switched to the children's show without a pontoon.
"Piggy Paige", "No mistake".
The president of Bellator's company, Scott Cook, said that they were going to be a part of the future program's organization to make sure that the British audience felt it.
"When I get to replay the race for a while, I think we'll probably be able to handle the problem."
"But it's Sunday at 6:00 a.m., and we'll wait until Sunday after work, and they can fix the problem first after work on Monday.
But we're still working on it.
And believe me, when it switched the picture, there were a lot of old cues.
We're trying to fix it. We think this is a technical failure.
But this time, this time, this is the government's problem.
I can assure you, it will never happen again.
We'll keep the game within five, not six, and, as usual, we'll set up more games for fans, and that's against the will.
It's good. "
Tom Daley feels inferior in terms of sex.
The Olympic jumper, Tom Daley, said that he felt like he couldn't handle anyone else because of his sexual orientation, but that was what motivated his success.
The 24-year-old son said that until he went to middle school, he realized it wasn't like everyone else.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . on four radio interview shows, The Wild Island Records, he openly talks about gay rights and gives hope to others.
He also said that he didn't care too much about winning or losing the Olympic Championship after becoming a human parent.
The longtime actor of the hot TV show, Jann, took a few months off because of his illness.
Daley's Laverne's first show, which looks like a throwaway, says she thinks she's growing up for the rest of the world, because he doesn't want to be socially acceptable.
And he said, "Today, I can't feel it, I can't feel it, I can't feel it, I can't feel it.
He said when they found out about their sexual orientation, he didn't want to disappoint everyone, he wanted to prove that he was a useful person.
The two Olympic bronze medalists have become known as gay athletes and are featured at this year's Australian British Commonwealth Games, calling for more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He said it was because he was so lucky to be public that he wasn't affected in any way, and he wanted to be able to hope for someone else.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013, and I was surprised to hear it.
Daley married his 20-year-old Oscar winner, but the age gap was never a problem.
You're going to have to go through so much, when she was 14 years old and three years later her father died of cancer, that she had a hard time talking about a guy of the same age who had experienced similar orgasms and low valleys.
And for the parents of Robert Ray Black Daley in June, Daley said that her vision had changed.
He said if you ask me the other year, I'll answer you and I'll need to win a gold medal.
You know what? Because there's something more important about Olympic gold.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
He was named after his father, Robert, who was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said her father didn't accept the fact that he was about to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they could buy the tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, and she wanted to sit in the front row.
He said I can't tell him you can't sit in the front row.
When she was about to stop breathing, I held her hand until she really stopped breathing, she died, and I finally admitted that she could win.
The following year, Daley attended the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
He said I still knew that diving in front of my home audience at the Olympics was my life's dream, and that there was nothing to replace.
It also inspired her to make the first song, "Hesser Small's Pride", which was co-produced with her during the Olympics, but still gave her a chicken skin.
. . . . . . . . . . . 11:15 U.S. Summertime, Sunday is a British Broadcasting Corporation radio broadcast of four interview shows, Wild Island Records.
. . . . . . . . . Saturday was a backup player at the Ryder Cup due to the poor state of Miklson.
United States player Phil Miklson will make a new record on Sunday's 47th Ryder Cup game, but it's gonna change its state.

The five-time winner did not seem like he used to play for the U.S. team all the time in the center of the race, and he used his time to be a cheerleader and bury his own game, hoping that it would correct his shortcomings.
Even at the peak of his professional career, the 48-year-old player did not play the straightest, and was not suitable for the demanding national golf club, where long-term rough training usually punished missed balls.
If the field isn't scary enough, it won four games this week against the British Open Champion Francisco Molinari, who partnered with the new show Tommy Frettwood.
If the U.S. team were four points behind the start of the 12th single game, with a good start, then the Miklson game might be decisive.
Florrick had faith in her men, but nothing else.
She said she knew exactly what she was doing today, took a picture of me in the back, held me down, and she was ready for the day.
He's got faith in himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame. He's been buried with him for the week.
I don't think he'll play two games.
I've got more, but that's the way it's gonna work, and it's the way we think it's gonna work.
He wants to go out, like everyone else.
. . . . . . . . . . . . Nick Faldo created the best game record of Sunday's Leyder Cup, but Miklson was about to break that record.
This may mark the end of Ryder Cup career, but its personal records are far from over.
At the time of the seven-and-a-half games, Miklson had 18 wins and 20 losses, even though Florrick had said that his appearance had given the team a new turn.
He explains that he's so funny, and he's a good teammate, and he's a hard man, and he's a smart guy, and he's a joker.
I've been with young players all week. It's been fun.
It's got a lot of stuff going on, not just the game.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjørn, knows how fast he won't lead the way.
With European team captain Thomas Bjørn, past experience, on the final day of the Leyder Cup singles, taking too much of the lead was a great pressure.

Bjørn, after watching the 2018 class games led by 5-3 on the same day on Friday, reminds himself that we are leading many of the Valdramabies, that we have won and lost in Brooklyn, that we have won the race in Vardrama, but that it is only a risky victory, and that we have turned it over before.
That's why history is not over for everyone on this team.
You'll be bored by the day.
Go out and do what you have to do.
You don't score on the blackboard, it's not over.
We have a goal, and we're going to win this trophy back.
I'm telling you, I care about the 12 players on our team, but we all know that they're the greatest players in the world.
Bjørn is happy that his players are doing so well on such a tough golf course, and in that respect I'll never be better than myself.
It's a different beast.
It's a personal show. It's another thing to do.
If things go well, it's a good thing to go out with your partner, but if you go out alone, you can test all your abilities as a golfer.
You have to try to do the best in the day, and this is the message you need to pass on to the player.
You need to leave your partner, too, and he needs to try to do the best he can.
In the same division as Jon, rival Jim Florrick wanted his players to play better in a single game than in a double game, with the exception of Jordan and Justin Thomas, who would ask for three points if they had a total of four points.

When asked about Captain Ben Crenshaw's last day of the game, in 1999, when he was reuniting with the players, he replied that every word he had at the time was clear.
We've got 12 important games in the air, but you're gonna start like you've seen in Brooklyn, like you've seen in Medina.
When the force moves in one direction, the pressure on the midfield is great.
We line up our faces and wait for the dropball player to come out with a sense of fashion, you know, we're going to be magic every day.

When Bjørn fell to his singles, he said that I went in that order, because I thought it covered the process.
The German warships were extended again.
According to local media reports, the latest German naval escort should have been in service in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War ship, but due to system failures and rising costs, it would have been ready to be in service by at least next year.
The German Times Weekly cited a military spokesman as saying that the pilot voyage of the entire New Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, the Rhineland-Pfaz, had now been delayed until the first half of 2019.
The ambitious ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the purchase was a problem.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and a drop of hidden technology, such as reducing radar, infrared synonyms.
Other important features include a longer warranty period, and the latest frigates should be able to deploy two years away from their home ports.
The German Times Weekly, however, noted that the delay meant that the most advanced ships, which were supposed to allow Germany to project forces abroad, were over in service.
In the old years, this unfortunate F125 frigate came to the newshead when the German Navy refused to make a transfer and sent it back to the Bloom-Forth Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after it had taken delivery.
The citizens know very little about the reasons for the retreat, but the German press invokes left-loop key factors such as software and hardware defects, which make the warship useless when it is on a combat mission.
The software deficiency is particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class frigate will be driven by about 120 crew members, only half of the old-fashioned Bremen-class escort crew.
Also, the ship is clearly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to enhance in the future.
It has been argued that this 7,000-ton Rhinepfaz weighs twice as much as a similar ship used by Germany in the second world.
With the exception of defective hardware, the price of a project, including the training of crews, has become a factor.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . is said to have increased from the original . 2.2 billion euros to the amazing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The problems facing the latest frigates have become particularly important because of the recent decline in German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, Hans Peter Buters, President of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the Navy was in fact "a ship that was no longer capable of deployment."
The official said that time was running out, and the problem was getting worse because the old ship was retired, but there was no new ship.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class escorts could join the Navy.
The secret life of the National Trust listening to bats.
One of the estates in the Highlands of Scotland is carrying out a new study aimed at revealing how bats use this land to eat.
It is hoped that this discovery will provide a new clue to the behaviour of this unique flying mammal and will help guide future environmental protection activities.
The study, carried out by scientists from the Scottish National Trust, will track the high-sound wings of West Inveru Garden, the brown long-ear bat and the Dobenton bat.
The special recorder will be located around the hotel to track bat events for a quarter.
The National Health Service staff and volunteers will conduct a mobile survey using hand-held equipment.
A professional voice analyser will determine the frequency of bats barking and the extent to which the burial drops are made.
A quiet map will be produced along with a report containing a detailed view of their actions.

The meadows make woodland that best preserves bats and other associated species, and this drop-in information will be beneficial in determining that there are edges to the management of the mortuary.
In the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and all over the United Kingdom declined significantly.
They are being threatened by the development of buildings, thus affecting habitat co-dwelling and habitat loss.
Wind generators and lighting all bring threats, such as chemical handling of fly paper with a drop of building material, and attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
But as a result of their practice of night-to-night hunting, in the hunting of prey, earlings are more useful than eyes.
They use complex echo positioning techniques to identify bugs and obstacles in the flight path.
The Scottish National Trust is responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings throughout the country, 38 important gardens with 76,000 acres of land, with great emphasis on bats.
There are 10 trained experts who conduct regular surveys to check the rest of the world and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has even established the first Scotland-specific bat conservation area in Dunvries and the Shriver Garden in Galloway, where eight of the ten Scottish bats live.
According to the real estate manager, David Thompson, this estate is their ideal location.
It's in Shriver. We have a place that fits the bat.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good resting places.
But there's a lot of things about bats that we don't know about, so what we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand that they need something to grow up first.

Ronaldo dismissed the rape charge because the lawyer intended to sue the German magazine.
Christiano Ronaldo called it a false news charge, saying that they wanted to use his name as a propaganda tool.
Her lawyer started filing a complaint against the German news magazine Mirror Weekly.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping a left American woman named Catherine Mayoga in the Las Vegas hotel room.
According to the Mirror Weekly on Friday, he was said to have paid $375,000 to a woman at the time, waiting for her to pursue the matter again.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . a few hours after the claim was reported. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
No, no, no, no, no.
This five-time Golden Globe winner told the mirror that all they reported today is fake news.
They want to sell themselves in my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous, so I'm famous, but it's part of the job.
The player smiles and adds that I'm a happy man, and everything is fine.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are beginning to charge the Mirror Weekly, which they say is called "an unacceptable report of suspicious behaviour in the privacy domain."
Counselor Christian Sheltz said that the player would seek compensation for "psychological damage comparable to the gravity of the infringement", which could be the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years.
It is alleged that the incident took place in a suite at the Las Vegas Palm Casino Resort in June 2009.
The documents submitted by the District Court of Clark County, Nevada, show that Ronaldo and Mayoga are reported to have raped her after meeting at the nightclub and then go back to the player's room.
Mayoga claimed that Ronaldo had kneeled after the alleged incident, and also told her that he was "99 per cent" a good man, but "1 per cent" disappointed him.
The document claims that Ronaldo admitted the sexual behaviour of the couple, but that both sides agreed.
Meoga also claimed that she went to the police station and was buried in a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because she felt that she would be retrieved and feared public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman said that her family was seeking to overturn the settlement agreement because her heart was constantly traumatized by the events.

The UK will regret losing its car manufacturer forever.
The Minister of Commerce, Greg Clark, said that the United Kingdom would regret forever if it lost its status as a world leader in the automobile manufacturing industry after its de-European graduation.
It also said that the British company had told the British radio station that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without an agreement, the Bernaston factory near Derby would suspend production, which was a matter of concern.
Mr. Clark said we need to reach an agreement.
The Japanese auto manufacturer said that the effects of border delays could lead to loss of employment if the UK did not reach an agreement on graduation.
The Bernaston factory, which produced Ores and Evans, produced no more than 150,000 cars in the past, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
The manager-in-chief of the Bernaston factory, Marvin Cook, said my point of view was that if the United Kingdom were to leave the European Union at the end of March, our factory would be discontinued.
other British automobile manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguars, are concerned that cross-border trade would leave the EU to do something like this in the absence of an agreement.
The BMW manufacturer, for example, said that the small factory in Oxford would be closed for a month after Britain's de-European graduation.
The main concern is related to the supply chain risks of auto manufacturers in the absence of an agreement to leave Europe.
The United Kingdom and EU suppliers supply parts every 37 minutes to produce cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, there may be confusion at the border, which, according to industry sources, could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
The company said that Toyota's stock at the Derbyshire factory could not have been longer than one day, and that if that were to happen, production would have stopped.

We need to reach an agreement, and he said to BBC Radio 4 today that we want the greatest benefit, not just the current success, but the opportunity.
There's evidence from other producers, not only the rich fields, that we definitely need to continue with this very successful supply chain.
In the long run, Toyota can't talk about the timing of the shutdown, but in the long run, warnings have been issued that increasing costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to a loss of employment.
After 24 years at the Bernaston factory, and at the convenor of the Union, Peter said that his members were increasingly worried that, in my experience, they would never come back if they lost their jobs.
A government spokesman said that we had put forward a precise and credible plan for the future of relations with the European Union.
The White House said that Trump's meeting with Schenstein might be delayed again.
On Sunday, the White House stated that the high-risk meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein might delay a week as the Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh's fight continued.

Trump won't fire the Deputy Attorney General so he can endanger Mueller's independence, and for months he's been talking about Washington.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the need to wear a cable to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the President through the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last week, he went to the White House and reported that he had resigned.
On the contrary, Thursday announced a meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York at the time.

On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the alleged incident of Cavanaugh, moving forward to delay the entire Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Saunders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
He said he was asked about the Rosenstein Conference: the date is not yet certain, it may be this week, considering all the other cases where the Supreme Court is in place, and I think it's possible to postpone it for another week.
But we're gonna see it. I'm just trying to get the press up to date.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The host, Chris Wallace, asked a question.
Even though he said that Saunders' briefing would be less than popularly flattered by television reporters, I'd agree with them.
She then suggested that Trump's direct contact with the press would increase.
He didn't give any evidence to add that the President's response to the questions had been more than any president before.
. . . . . . Saunders's briefing is still going to be held, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the President directly, it would be much better for me.
We've tried to do a lot, and in the last few weeks, you've seen us doing a lot, and when you can talk to the President of the United States, you've already replaced the press conference.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . when leaving the White House or attending a public meeting or a press reception of fellow dignitaries.
A person's news release will be very small.
This week, the President of New York may prove that it's strange to show up casually in front of reporters.
The Secretary of Health wrote to the European Union staff of the National Association of Health Services in Scotland on the issue of graduation from Europe in the United Kingdom.
The Secretary-General of Health of the United Kingdom wrote to the European Union staff of the National Health Services Association of Scotland, expressing gratitude and hoping that they would remain in Scotland after their graduation.
Senator Jenny Freeman of Scotland sent a letter when he left the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union until six months ago.
The Scottish government has been working to pay for settlement applications for European Union citizens working in decentralized public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote on the side of her letter: In the summer, the United Kingdom and the European Union also continued to negotiate a withdrawal, hoping that a decision could be made this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in order to prevent a failure to reach an agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
And that's why I want to repeat, regardless of their nationality on the side, that I value the contributions of every employee.
Our colleagues from the European Union and other countries have brought valuable experience and technology to strengthen and improve health services and to benefit the same community as the patients we serve.
Scotland is your househouse. We'd like you to stay here.

It had five slings before leaving the game on Saturday, bringing the total number of slings in its season to 18.
Foreign buyers will pay higher stamp taxes when they buy housing in the United Kingdom.
According to the plans of the New Conservatives, foreign buyers will pay higher stamp taxes in the UK to help homeless people.
This will offset Corbin's success in attracting young voters.
Print tax increases will be charged to people who don't pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury is planning to raise 120 million euros a year to help homeless people.
. . . . . . Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will pay higher stamp taxes when buying property in the United Kingdom, and that the higher portion will be used to help homeless people.
This approach will be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Colbin's promise to provide more economy, which has worked hard to attract young voters with housing co-opts to high-income populations.
The increase in stamp taxes will be charged to individuals and companies that don't pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional funding will boost the government's efforts to reduce the number of surfers.
The surcharge referred to is that, in addition to the current stamp tax, a higher surcharge, possibly up to 3 per cent, was levied two years ago on the second housing unit and the purchaser.
The Ministry of Finance expects this practice to raise up to €120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London were purchased by non-British residents, which led to higher prices, making it more difficult for those who purchased them for the first time.
The rich regions of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the fact that most foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
Boris Johnson called for the reduction of the stamp tax to help more young people own their first housing package, but a few weeks later the new policy came out.

Mr. Corbin announced a series of interesting reform proposals, including rent control and an end to no-fault deportation.
He also hoped to give the council greater power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said that, in the old years, I would say that the Prime Minister's term was to restore the British dream, and that every generation should live better.
That means fixing our broken estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life.
But it's as easy for individuals who don't live in the United Kingdom to buy houses as for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a home becomes too far away, and the insults to the vagrants are still too real.
My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland.
Sunderland chief Jack Ross said that his ultimate goal was to become Scottish chief at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish is now enjoying the challenges of the revival Northeastern Club, currently third in the ACL and three points from the first.

Ross and BBC Scotland Channel said I got a B-class hat, that's all.
But I watched a lot of Scottish games with my dad in Hampton, and it was always dripping me back.
Although it's only when I'm successful in managing the club.

The former boss of Aloe said he was not surprised by the large and famous club that had rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich's proposals.
My success will depend on "Can I return the club to the Super League?"
Because of the club's structure and facilities, it certainly belongs to the British Super League.
It's not an easy thing to do, but if I could get the club back to their place, I might just feel like I'm doing well here.

Rose said she felt comfortable at any point in her career as a player at Clyde, Hartpur, Falcock, St. Millen and Hamilton College.
He recalled that this might be the real crossroads in taking over Aloya at the palm.
I really think management is better for me than playing.
It sounds strange, because I've done a good job of living with it and enjoying the joy that it deserves.
But it's probably hard to play.
You've got a lot to do every week.
We'll still have pressure down and work, but it's not wrong to manage it.
I want to manage, and my family finally dreams of being true, and I have full confidence in my whole adult life.
You can listen to a full interview with the Scottish Radio Sports Voice on Sunday, September 30, between 12:00 and 13:00 during the British Summer.
The investigation found that Saturday at 5:30 p.m. was the best time for a pint beer.
The heat of the summer raised the income of the pubs that the United Kingdom was forced to maintain, but the pressure of the chain was greater.
The data show that the sales of the tavern and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but the restaurant's turnover declined by 4.8 per cent.
The business consulting firm registered accountant Peter Martin, who compiled the data, said that the continued sun and English team were taking longer than expected to participate in the World Cup, meaning that the situation in July was similar to the previous month in June, when the bar's sales grew by 2.8 per cent, but the restaurant's sales would be worse.
The restaurant sales fell by 1.8 per cent in June, and the sales in July were even worse.
The drinking-oriented tavern and bar sales are the sharpest of the day, compared to the drop in the restaurant sales.
Food-based bars also have an impact on sales due to frequent sunlight, although there are no restaurants.
Looks like everyone just wants to go out and have a drink.
The hotel and the pub that run it grew by 6.6 per cent and the food sales decreased by 3 per cent over the month.
The RSM agency's rest and hotel analyst, Paul Newman, said, "The results we've seen from the end of April, and the situation is going on."
The weather and the important social or sports movement are still the biggest factors affecting marketing in the outdoor market.
It's not surprising that the catering industry continues to fall into a depression, even though, under constant cost pressure, it fell by 4.8% over the same period as the previous year's sales, a painful one.
For food-oriented operators, when the summer is not a good time, time will prove to us that in August we will be able to provide a much-needed breath. "
In July, including the newly opened bar and burial restaurant, total sales grew by 2.7 per cent, reflecting the slow roll-out of the brand.
The collection of "coffee tracking" sales monitoring software for British pubs, pubs and burial restaurants, and the analysis of data on the performance of 47 operating groups, the total operating value of which exceeds £9 billion, are recognized industry benchmarks.
One-fifth of the trails have their own secret social media accounts that don't give their parents a clue.
According to the survey, one fifth of the trails (with drops as young as 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that don't allow parents to bury their teachers.
According to the survey data of 20,000 secondary school students, the number of pages of the "false essay" is increasing.
The news adds to the public's concern about publishing pornographic material.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a "master" account that allows their parents to see it.
One-fifth of the trails (with drops as young as 11 years old) they create social media accounts here, not for adults to know.
A survey of 20,000 middle-school students showed that the "fake photo wall" account - graphic sharing social networking sites, this number is growing rapidly.
The news adds to the public's concern about publishing pornographic material.
20% of students say that they have a "master" account that has been cleaned up for parents to see, while they also have a private account-figure sharing social networking site.
A mom accidentally saw her 13-year-old girl's secret website and found a kid in the office who "rape me."
A survey conducted by the "British Digital Awareness" meeting with the headmaster of the Burial shows that 40 per cent of students between the ages of 11 and 18 have two accounts, half of whom admit to own a private account.
HMC's director, Mike Bryan, said, "Many teenagers have lured them to create a web space that their parents and teachers can't access, and this is a fearsome one."
Irid Doyle will be the "activist's spokesperson" for the Scottish Athletics Commission.
At the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics Association, Alid Doyle was rated as a non-executive member of the board.
Irid Doyle, the most prestigious track and field athlete in Scotland, and the chairman, Ran Beatty, said that the man who guided the sport offered a good opportunity to benefit from the extensive experience that Elid Doyle had had at the international level over the past 10 years.
"Alid's in Scotland, England and the rest of the world are respected, and we believe that Scotland's athletics will be of great benefit if she joins us."
Doyle: "I'm happy to speak for the athletes, and I wish I could really lead Scottish sports with a few contributions to it."

The emulator ad caused controversy online over comparing mother to cow.
A milk-absorption company has started a debate online over the publication of an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows.
The company launched a claim that it was "the world's first non-speakable emulator" and that the consumer technology company Elvi released a short film inspired by music that showcased the freedom of this new emulator belt for Mom.
The four real moms danced with songs in a cow shed filled with hay, and the lyrics were as follows: "No mistake, I suck my own milk, but you can't see a tail." And buried, "If you don't know that's not cow breasts, I'll tell you that's my breasts."
"Pump it out, pump it out, I'll feed their babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'll squeeze my breasts."
However, when the ad was posted on the company's Facebook homepage, it caused controversy on the web.
The film received 77,000 views of the same number as hundreds of reviews, and the audience had a different resonance, and many people said that it diluted the "dark side" of the dairy industry.
"To promote this product with cows is not a wise decision.
Like us, they all need to be pregnant to give birth to milk, unless their baby is stolen in a few days. "There's one comment.
This Elvi sucker can be carefully placed in the breast of the lactation.
Another comment was made: "It's not hard to understand that it's a damage to both mother and baby.
But why don't they use them to promote a milk pump to raise their own baby? "
It was added: "It's really an advertisement that's out of touch with reality."
Some people defended the ad, and a woman said she thought the song was funny.
"I think this is really a good idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one back.
Pumping milk makes me feel like a cow myself.
The ad is a little crazy, but I'm sure I'm going to see how it is.
It's a genius product. "A review.
The other comment was: "The ad was so interesting that it wanted Mom to pump milk (usually in a back-to-work place or in a toilet) to feel like a "cow".
It's not an ad that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.
At the end of the short film, a group of ladies revealed that they were always dancing with a sucker that was put in the chest.
The idea behind this movement is that a lot of women who use milk pumpers say they feel like cows and they're getting insights.
But it's the Elvi milk pump that can be completely silent, without any wire pipe, and can be carefully placed in the breast of the lactation, allowing women to move freely, hold the baby, or even go out of the street at the time of the pump.
As Mother's partner and creative director, Anna Ballalin commented: Elvi sucking milk is a novelty product that deserves to be bold enough to launch the same attempt.
By comparing a woman to a cow, we want to place all the challenges of sucking with her in a spotlight, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom that a new emulsion can bring.
This isn't Elvy's first time on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother with a tight product and two trails appeared on the designer Marta Jakubowski's fashion show.
Hundreds of immigrant children, still chickens, moved to tent camps on the Texas border.
The number of border crossings per month remains largely unchanged, but the number of migrant children detained has increased in part because of the harsh rhetoric and policy of the Trump administration, which makes it more difficult for children to be placed in the caregiver.

The federal authorities announced in June that potential insurers and adult members of the family must submit fingerprints and that the accompanying data would be shared with the Immigration Service, making the risk much more risky.
Last week, Matthew Albens, an inter-officer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested several dozen minors who had applied to secure their families.
The agency then determined that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
Almost 80 per cent of the insurers or members of their businesses entered the country illegally, and most of them were foreign nationals who committed crimes.
So we'll keep chasing these people," said Mr. Albens.
The shelter workers claimed that, in order to deal with the children quickly, the officials had issued new rules requiring the children to appear in court within a month, instead of listening to them after 60 days.
Many will argue their legal status with the immigration judge through a video conference, not in person.
Some of the people who are considered ineligible for help will be expelled immediately.
According to reports from the shelter workers together with several months of the shelter system, the longer the children stay in the place, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which leads to more violent incidents and more attempts to escape.
In a large facility similar to Tonilow, the advocates said, the above-mentioned problems will be more prominent and, due to their scale, children's problems will be more easily ignored.
They add that if they don't have enough time to prepare their children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends, moving them to tent camps will only deepen children's trauma.
Syria demands that the United States, France and Turkey "occupying troops", leave immediately.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Mualim, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly calling on Syrian refugees to return home, i.e., the Syrian war has entered its eighth year.
According to Mualim, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, foreign troops illegally broke into Syrian territory by attacking terrorist elements, "violators will be dealt with accordingly."
"They have to withdraw immediately without conditions," she said at the convention.
The Mualim insisted that Syria's "era of war on terror is about to end" and that since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have been driven out of their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "the fight until we cleared all Syrian territories of "the existence of terrorist organizations and the burial of illegal aliens."
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly for the Kurdish army against President Bashar al-Assad, which provides military training with Syrian Arabs.
France has sent more than 1,000 soldiers to this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, there was no problem with the return of refugees to their homes in Mualim, and after that she accused "a Western country" of spreading unfounded rumors and panic, causing the refugees to leave.
"We call upon international social and humanitarian organizations to facilitate and reach out to their fellow citizens who wish to go back to their homes. "
"They are politicizing what is supposed to be purely humanitarian issues. "
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not provide Syria with any reconstruction support until Assad reached an agreement with the reactionaries to end the war.
The United Nations diplomat said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which had decided to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel base in Idlib Province, Syria, was conducive to the promotion of political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement allowed the province to escape a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces, a province inhabited by three million inhabitants.
But Mualem stressed that there was a "clear time frame" for this agreement, and he said that it was hoped that military action would target the holy warriors, including the Nusra warriors who had contact with the base, and "weed them to the root."
The United Nations Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hoped that the first meeting of the new committee, formed by the Government and opposition, would be called as early as possible to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.

Why would Trump be re-elected?
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win a re-election in 2020, unless, as the liberals think, the impeachment and the scandal will end Trump's presidency ahead of schedule.

It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th electoral district holds a large amount of funding, and this reorganization, which is due to the parliamentary electoral district, allows two voters to compete for the same seat.

In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was able to recreate the map after it had been established that the old electoral district would be divided in an unfair manner to Republican gains.
In the competition for the 17th new electoral district, the main party's finance ministry, the Democratic Party's campaign committee, and the buried Republican National Council triggered a campaign for financial struggle.

The diplomat noted that the Dominican Republic, along with Panama, had recognized Beijing, while Washington had almost no backlash.
. . . . . . . Mr. Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and was staying in a hotel in Panama until his partner drove the Trump Group's management team away.
The U.S. State Department spokesman Heather Nolte stated in that month that the U.S. State Department had decided to recall Salvado on the grounds of "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan" and that the Dominican Republic and Panama were responsible for the U.S. diplomatic ambassador.
But it is clear that Salvado will be punished, and in 2017 Salvado received aid from the United States for an estimated $140 million, including narcotic drug control, development and economic assistance.
The penalties imposed include the removal of visa restrictions on economic assistance and gender equality, which are no doubt painful for Central American countries with high unemployment rates and murder rates.
. Following the internal meeting, North American and Central American officials delayed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic development as a follow-up to a similar meeting in the past year, an important step towards preventing immigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administrators made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue and effectively end all considerations regarding the punishment of Salvador.
According to the diplomat, Vice President MacPence, who said that the plan was to be scheduled for mid-October, was a signal to the attention of this meeting.
The three U.S. Ambassadors, Quiet Chickens, returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, but received no information on penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesman refused to comment on the controversial statements of three United States officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal matters anonymously.

The vagabonds Grauldurans remained optimistic in the conflict with the Vienna Rapid Sports.
On Thursday, after an impressive draw between Spain and Villaré, the Vanderers were able to win against the Vienna Rapid Sports Team, which would have given them a strong position in Group G of the European Cup.
Midfielder Grauldurans' knee injury left him with no way to make his debut this season until he tied the Billian Rays to a 2-2 draw, but he believed that the vagrants could use it as a springboard to achieve better results.
A 31-year-old said, "This is a good thing because the Billian Rays are a good team."

Although the survey showed that participants clearly showed that they needed to be taken care of, it was a good thing that few people would talk to their own housekeepers about the matter.
Research in national insurance companies shows that half of the participants said that they had spent long periods of time with their partners on nursing.
Only 10 percent of them told their children.
The deputy director of the life insurance company, Holly Snyder, said, "People want to take care of them more, but they don't go to the house to communicate with them. "

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Nissia, India
The officials reported that Friday's attack on the Indian state of Nissia Palou was marked by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that killed at least 384 people, with an expected increase in the number of deaths.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . due to the disruption of the electrical communication network, the rescue team was unable to obtain any communication information from East Gala County, which is located north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the Palou disaster.
The following are some of the highlights of the Palou County, located on Sulawesi Island:
The Palou, the capital of Central Sulawesi Island, sits at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, estimated to have a population of 379,800 in 2017.

The federal prosecutor sought a rare death sentence against a suspected terrorist attack in New York City.
The New York federal prosecutor is seeking the death penalty on Sauflo Saipov, a suspect in the New York-based terrorist attack that killed eight people - the second time that the state has imposed extremely rare penalties on federal criminals since 1953.
In October, the 30-year-old Saipoff driver's rented pickup truck was attacked on a bicycle lane along the Manhattan West Highway, before cutting down the pedestrians along the road with the bike riders.
According to the notice of intent submitted to the Southern District of New York requesting the death penalty, the prosecutor, in order to justify the death penalty, must provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused bodily harm.
According to the law, both of these crimes are punishable by death.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . weeks after the events occurred, the federal mass jury filed 22 charges against Saipov, which included eight murder charges that the federal prosecutor frequently used in organizing the crime, along with an example of violent crime and sabotage of the motor vehicle.
The prosecutor said that the attack required "a lot of elaborate planning and conspiracy" and described Saipov's terrorist attacks with "extremely brutal, hard-hearted and morally corrupt" Ley.
The letter of intent mentions that "Sauflo Habiblovi Saipov has caused injury and damage to Diego Ink Angrini, Nicholas Clewie, Anrawl Dica, Dain Dak, Ariel Elli, Hernán Felloch, Hernán Diego Mendoza, Alicedo Damian Panico's family and friends."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the death penalty was last prosecuted in the southern part of New York.
In September 2009, Khalid Banen was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to his final term of imprisonment.
The case in which the death penalty was executed in the last New York Commonwealth case occurred in 1953, when a married couple, Julia and Arthur Rosenberg, were eventually sentenced to death for being recognized as Soviet spies during the Cold War two years earlier.
On 19 June 1953, the death penalty was executed on married men and women sitting in an electric chair.

The police said it felt very good when they told the investigating officer that they were carrying out the attack.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . according to the
The police said that Saipov also said that he had displayed the Islamic flag in the hospital ward.
However, in the face of 22 charges, he said he wouldn't plead guilty.
One of Saipov's federal public defenders, David Parton, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"I think that seeking the death penalty, rather than a life sentence, will only prolong the trauma that this matter brings to all the victims," Pardon said.
Saipov's defence team had earlier suggested to the federal prosecutor that the death penalty should not be imposed.
The Conservatives claim that Nejefarage should be held responsible for the British de-European negotiations.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in the Conservative Conference of Nejefarage today, vowed to "activate the People's Army".
The leader of the British Independent Party said that politicians needed to "perceive the European skeptics' strength" because a Derezamei's own councillor suggested that they should be in charge of the EU negotiations.
The Conservatives' post-parliamentary MP, Peterborn, said in his parade line in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage was to serve as Ambassador de-European, the British would have finished de-European.
But the challenge faced by Ms. Meyer is to move her divided team, and the Conservatives have joined the team against de-Europeans, which is even more prominent.
In the anti-European struggle between the remaining Europeans and the European Union, the Prime Minister struggled to keep the Cheks project on track.
The allies said they would continue their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels and force European skeptics and Labour to choose between their projects and their confusion.
Mr. Byrne spoke to Soricher's Leave Means Leave organization, who wanted to get rid of this Cheks project.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He said, "If he's in charge, we've managed to get out of the country."
Werlingboro's councillor added that I would support the British de-European but that we needed to get rid of the Cheyennes project.
He expressed his opposition to the European Union: we fought the world war not to be humbled.
I wish I could make laws that belong to me in my own country. '
Mr. Señor rejected the suggestion that public law had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The British people have changed their minds, and the law left behind is completely wrong.’
The Conservatives also took part in the week's parade with Andrea Jenkins, who told reporters, ‘I'm just trying to say, Prime Minister, please listen to the voice of the people.
The Chicks deal is not popular, the opposition doesn't vote for it, it's not popular with the Conservatives, and the activists will march in the streets, so I'll be elected at the first time.
Please give up the Cheks Treaty and listen to the voice of the people. '
In Ms. Bimay's message, she added that the Prime Minister could keep a job if he could keep his promise.
Mr. Farage told the rally politicians that if they chose to betray the decision of the 2016 referendum, they would be "unusually passionate".
He said, ‘IKEA is a trust issue between my people and the political class.’
'They tried to betray me, and I wanted to tell them today, 'I'm not going to do this to you.'
In order to get more information from the enthusiastic people, he added: ‘I hope you can make some of my political classes feel the same kind of enthusiasm and power, because they are on the verge of breaking the European border.’
My active National People's Army, they can bring victory to the de-Europeans, and they will never stop before I become an independent, self-governing and proud England.
At the same time, Luo-Pei marched in Birmingham and held a two-hour rally downtown.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . when the week group event opens, some scattered activists wave the Conservative Party against de-European flag.
The Labour Party MP Adonis mocked the Conservatives at the opening of the conference and had problems with the party's internal procedures.
‘As I know, they can have all the information technology systems that can be adapted to Canada+, to the landless free trade that can be applied to Ireland's landless free trade, ' which they supplement.
‘It's all in a farce.
There's nothing to call a creditable deutsche, ‘it's a supplement.

The first of Wittel's cars into the maintenance area to get Hamilton into the tail of the team, which was supposed to be decisive.
The Mercedes entered the maintenance area after one lap, behind Wittel, but Hamilton took the lead on the wheel, and one Ferrari driver left the inside after making a sharp turn of defense at the third bend.

Hamilton said, "It's a tough day, because Waltley's been a great weekend, and he's a real gentleman for me.
The team did such a great job on the left, winning number one and number two. "
It's the worst limb language in the family.
United States President Donald Trump, at one of his Saturday rallies, mocked Senator Diana Zestan for insisting that he had not leaked letters from Cristina Brascifort accusing Supreme Court candidate Brat Cavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony in the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "dirty, dirty, dishonest."
He said, "There's one thing that happened in the past few days, one thing that's great, and you can see people who are angry, who are angry, who are mean, who are shameless, who are not honest."
"When you see the news and the leak, they'll say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it. "
Remember?
Diana Vanstein, have you leaked anything?
Remember her answer... that you didn't leak the file... "Oh, oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it.
Well, wait a minute.
It imitates the senator: I leaked it... no, we don't leak it.
At the time of July, Ford sent a letter to Zestan detailing the charges against Cavanaugh, which was leaked earlier in September, but Zestan denied that it had been leaked by his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story, "Master of Congress" reported.
"He wanted me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as he asked."
But it seems that his denial was not recognized by the President, who commented at a rally on Saturday night: "Let me talk to you, really the worst body language.
Maybe it didn't, but this is the worst limbic language I've ever seen. "
The President continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate who had been accused of sexual harassment by three women, suggesting that Democrats were using the charges to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to return to power by any means necessary.
You can see their mean, shameless, they don't care about hurting people on the side, they don't care about having to crush people on the side to get power and control on the left. "Mediaite website reports.

The plane crashed in Micronesia, New Guinea Airlines said a man was missing after the crash.
The operating company of a flight that crashed in Lake Harlem in the Pacific, Micronesia, said that a man had been missing, and the company previously said that all 47 passengers had been safely evacuated from the wrecked aircraft.
In a press release, New Guinea stated that as of next day on Saturday, the company could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The airline said they were working with the local government, hospitals, investigators to try to reach the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The plane, which was trying to land at Chuk Island Airport, fell into water, and the local boats helped rescue the other passengers and the crew.
Officially on Friday, seven people have been taken to the hospital </seg>.
The airline said, by Saturday, six more passengers were staying in the hospital, and their condition was stable.
It's not clear why the crash happened in exactly the same order as the burial.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy indicate that the plane landed in a lake not far from the runway.
Some witnesses think the plane ran out of the runway.
The U.S. passenger, Bill Jaynes talker, flew so low.
Janes said, "That's a very good thing about this department."

The analyst lists the time line for a woman to burn her fruit alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution stopped re-trialing a man on his left, who accused him of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
In the United States, Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the Department of Justice, testified as an expert witness in the intelligence analysis field.
He gave an overview of the late killing of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Teris and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, by means of a phone record.
According to "Clarion Ledger", Rollett claimed that he had received data on the location of several mobile phones, showing that Tylis was buried in Chambers after his death, which contradicted her previous doctrine.
The data shows that when he told his friend Michael Sandford that he was buried, his cell phone was with Chambers, and the police went to talk to Sandford.
Sanford's in court on Saturday, and she's not in town.
When the prosecutor asked her about Telis, she said she was in Saunders's truck, wasn't it the truth, Sanford said, "She was talking nonsense, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another paradox is that when Tylis said Chambers was killed, he had known him for about two weeks.
The phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
In Rollett's words, some time after Chambers was killed, Telis removed Chambers' message from his phone, and the phone was connected to the way it was buried.
Heil: "It wiped it out of his life."
The defense plans to start closing the case on Sunday.
According to the judge, it was expected that the trial would be handed over to the jury at a later date.

Another black guy?
New York nanny's been fired for "racist" text messages.
A New York nanny filed a lawsuit against her husband and wife for discriminatory dismissal for receiving a false message from her mother complaining that she was "another black man."
And to deny their parents that they are racists, it's like a "false."
The mother of the two trails, Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, found out when he returned to work on the first day of 2016 that the new child nurse, Giselle Morris, was a black man and was so disappointed.
In her message, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote, "No, it's a black man. </seg>
But, yes, she didn't send the text to her husband, but she sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his own failings, one of the "uncomfortful" Plasco Fluxmans fired Ms. Morris, saying that the work of the African-American nanny, who was about to leave, was not doing well, and that he was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Ms. Morris was only given one day's labor, and was sent back to her home after that.
The family, Morris, is pressing charges against the husband and the wife, asking them to pay compensation for the dismissal and asking for a daily compensation of $350 for the six months of accommodation that they were initially hired to work, despite the absence of a contract.
In an interview with the New York Post on Friday, she said, "I want to show them, remember, you can't do this," and said, "I know this is a discrimination. "
It makes sense to counter the husband's and wife's claims to their racists to end Morris' hiring relationship, because his fear offends him and can't be trusted after that.
My husband Joel Plasco told the Post, "My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not all racists. "
"But will you give your details to someone you used to be rude to, even if you misconstrue them once?
You're a born boy?
That's enough."
Plasco compared the suit to "extortion", which said that his wife was going to have a baby two months later, and that the situation was "very difficult."
And this investment banker said, "What kind of guy do you want?
That's not a good idea. "
Even though this individual case is still very tight, the court of inquiry has condemned it in the social media.
According to the latest letter, the publishers of Paddington Bears are worried that the readers will not be interested in a bear who knows what to say.
When Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born after the book was accepted, she said, "It's hard to put herself in the position of the person who read it for the first time before it was published.
The family knows how interesting our knowledge of the great success of Paddington Bears is. "
Her father wrote this children's book before it was published by a bear, a BBC photographer who was optimistic about the rejection of his work, and who said that after his father passed away in the past, the book's 60th anniversary was "massive".
With regard to the Paddington Bear, he described it as "a very important member of our family," and said that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
He said, "It's a very quiet person, not a man who talks nonsense. "
"But because the Paddington Bear is so real to them, it's as if if your children had accomplished something, you'd be proud of them, despite the fact that you didn't.
I think that's how it works for Paddington Bears.
Even though it's her creative imagination, it's her direct credit to Paddington Bears.
My daughter is dying. I just have to say good-bye on the phone with her.
After the plane landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
Ms. Ednan-Laprus said, "Nad's frequent calls are really bad, and he might not be able to make it."
"Then I got a call from Nader saying that he couldn't last two minutes, and I should say goodbye to him.
I'll do it.
I said, "Jassie, I love you very much. I love you very much.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The medicine the doctor had to eat to keep her heart beating slowly, leaving her body.
It's over for a few days. It's over.
I just have to sit here and wait. I understand that's all.
I can't howl, shout, or shout, because my family is around me with the rest of them.
I really have to stick with it. "
At the end of the day, Ms. Ednan-Lapus, who had lost her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, and no one knew the pain of her calendar.
He said, "No one will understand."
"I kept my head down and cried straight down.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt strong sympathy for Nader.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her. "
The grieving woman put a card on the bridge to prevent suicide.
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide are trying to stop others from ending their lives.
. . . . . Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put a sticker on the Welsh Bridge, with inspiring words and phone numbers on the card, and people could call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son Taylor was depressed at the age of 13 and killed himself at the age of 18.
He said, "I don't want any parents to feel the fruit that I feel every day."
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says he's a promising cook and has an infectious smile.
"Everyone knows him because of his smile.
They say that their smile shines on every house on the left. "
However, he gave up his job before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Taylor's kid, 11 years old, found his brother after Taylor's suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm just worried about a chain reaction."
Ms. Davis made these cards, "so that people know that you can go and talk to others and talk to them, even friends.
Don't sit there in silence. You need to talk. "
Ms. Humphreys, a friend of Ms. Davis's for many years, lost her 15-year-old partner after her mother passed away.
He said, "It didn't say that she felt depressed or depressed or anything else."
"On the first few days of Christmas, we noticed a change in her attitude.
On Christmas Day, it's depressed - when other people open their gifts, they don't have any eye contact with them or anything else. "
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to try to overcome it: "This thing rips a hole in the family.
It separates us.
But we all have to fight for it. "

As the FBI begins its investigation, the future of Brett Kavanaugh remains undecided.
On Saturday, Fryk said, "I think that if we really get the kind of investigation that she's asking for -- a limited time and scope -- maybe we can bring less unity," he said, and he was worried that the committee "crashed" in a deep-rooted party deadlock.
Why would Mr. Cavanaugh, along with his Republican supporters, not want the FBI to investigate?
Their resistance is entirely due to the timing.
Five weeks from the midterm election on November 6th - if the Republicans did not perform well as expected, then the efforts of those they wanted to elect the U.S. Supreme Court would be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to tell them that they support Mr. Kavanaugh, who used to work for Bush at the White House and through whom he knew his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI release of the report?
The Senate will proceed with a vote, and there are currently 51 Republican MPs with 49 Democrats.
It is not clear at this point that Mr. Cavanaugh's department could have won at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that this would have led Vice President Mike Penns to break the deadlock and confirm his entry into the Supreme Court.
The number of Korean defectors under Kim Jong-un.
In the seven years since Kim Jong-un came to power, the number of Korean defectors to Korea has been reduced.
. . . . . . In comparison to the 2706 defectors in 2011, the number of defectors in the old years was 1127.
Mr. Kuo said that the more stringent border controls between China and Korea and the higher costs charged by the miners are a key factor.
No public comments were made on the Pyongyang side.
Most of the Korean defectors eventually acquired citizenship.
The Seoul side stated that after the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 Koreans had crossed the border illegally.
Most people escape from Korea through China, the longest border line between China and Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded non-military zone (DMZ) between Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
China sees these people as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and forcibly repatriates them.
Strictly speaking, the relationship between Korea and Korea is still tense, but in recent months there has been some relief.
A month ago, leaders of both Korea and Korea held talks in Pyongyang, focusing on the denuclearization of the deadlocked talks.
In June, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held a historic meeting in Singapore, where a broad consensus was reached on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But just on Saturday, Foreign Minister Li Yongho of Korea accused the United States of imposing sanctions to make no progress.
In a speech at the United Nations in New York, Li Yong-ho said, "We have no trust in the United States, so we don't have confidence in our country's security, and in this case we don't have the possibility to first disarm ourselves in one way or another."

the House of Representatives leader Nancy Pelosi "hysteria" claimed that Supreme Court nominee Bret Cavanaugh was not appointed to the Supreme Court by virtue of his character.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . at the Texas Forum held in Austin, Texas's capital on Saturday.
"I can't stand it, if a woman ever behaves like that, they'll talk about it 'hysteria'."
Brett Cavanaugh strongly denied his allegations of sexual abuse, and Christine Blessey Ford, when they were in the middle of a posterior-daughter fight.
Cavanaugh was excited about the period of his opening statement, when he talked about his family's high school appearance, and he cried, and he choked.
It was also clear that he had condemned the Democrats of the Committee, and that they were dissatisfied with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election, in response to their allegations of "a ridiculous and organized murder of his personality" organized by liberals.
In Pelosi's words, he believes that Cavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't serve in the Supreme Court, as it can be seen that he is biased against the Democrats.
He said, "I don't think it's the way it said it and the way it attacked the Clintons and the Democrats, that he's no longer qualified to serve in the Supreme Court."

"What I'd like to say is, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not alone fit to be a justice of the Supreme Court, or to serve as a judge of the court of justice of the family."
Cavanaugh is now a judge in Washington, D.C., visiting the court.
Pelosi added, as a Democrat, that he was concerned about the decision that Cavanaugh might make in the Pair Medical Act or Roy v. Wade case. Henry Wade, they felt that they were in a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Cavanaugh avoided some of the questions that he would have about to overturn the Supreme Court ruling.
"Pelocy: "What if a hysterical, biased man goes to court and expects us to say that he's okay?"
The lady needs to use it.
It's a decent thing, months and years of anger, and it screams as soon as it opens its mouth.
Ms. Steiner said to me 45 years later, "When we're ready to shout."
I don't think it's unusual. What do you think?"
She went on to say, "A lady who used to be the executive in a certain place, who helped me a lot, who said that when she cried for a while, she didn't become a skill, and when she started crying for a while, she said to the people around me, "You don't think I'm happy?"
"I'm really in the middle of it."
And then he went on.
I think that's pretty sharp.
The eye is allowed to be used as a mode of distribution, partly because they've been mistaken since the beginning.
I was most impressed by the fact that I was working in a male-dominated office a few years ago, and I felt that there was no way to express myself in words that I really was, and that the older woman caught me on the back and dragged me to the stairs, and that she was usually a cold manager, and I was surprised at her.
He said to me, "Don't let them know you're shouting."
They don't know you're here.
Because they've got you, they'll find you sad.
In Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Colorado Democratic Party, he worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, on a ship named Monkey Business, the Hartbeans discovered an affair, who withdrew from the campaign and Schroder was so frustrated that they had no reason to abandon the presidential campaign.
After 30 years, she laughed at me and said, "That's not a very thought-provoking decision. "
There are already seven candidates in the campaign, and they don't need one more.
They call them Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
It's already at the end of the campaign, and his fund-raising has fallen, so he vows that unless $2 million is raised, if it's not there, he won't run.
It's a loss.
He found out that his fans had paid the man $1,000, but the clean house had paid him $250.
She said, "Don't they think I'm losing my head?"
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she had mixed feelings about how hard it was to raise money and put it in a way that was not representative of the electorate, and that she was very upset about the gender discrimination of the fruit drop.
Schroeder's got a reaction to them, and he said, "Do you think I've got a clue?"
You all feel so comfortable in my business sponsor.
I've been here all day, and they'll be writing on my gravestone.
"Where is she shouting?"
What's the deal between China and the United States?
The expert says that the outbreak of trade between China and the United States is deaf and that, although none of the lines of war are over, in the long run the rift between the two countries may be beneficial to China's development.
In this year's year, U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning to tax China's major export products, including solar-energy battery panels, steel and aluminum.
In this week, the tax level is high, and the new customs tax has affected $200 billion (£15 billion) worth of commodities, which is actually a half of the commodity tax on exports from China to the United States.
Every time China takes countermeasures with the same pipeline, it has recently added 5 to 10 per cent to the tax on $60 billion in American goods.
The Chinese vowed to push ahead beyond the United States, and the world's second largest economy could not make concessions in a short period of time.
It's the same thing to say about America, but in China, it's too low to say it to America.
In spite of this, experts say that if China could play the cards in hand, the pressure of the American trade war might have been on China for a long time by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
The think tank's New American Security Center, an assistant who focuses on Asian studies, said Abigail Grays, a political decision by the United States or China, may bring about a downturn in the economies of these two countries, leading to an economic downturn, which is actually a much more dangerous situation for spectators.
The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said that the Syrian government has prepared the sun for the return of the refugees.
In Syria, we have prepared for the return of refugees of our own free will, and we call on all of you to help rebuild this country, which has been destroyed by war for seven years.
The Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Mualem, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, where the situation in our country improved.
He said, "There has been a great deal of progress in the fight against terrorists, and the situation in the area is now more stable and safe."
The government will continue to repair the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
Refugees who wish to return to their homes have no means of leaving the country because of the unilateral economic sanctions imposed by terrorists on their daily lives.
According to United Nations statistics, more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from their homes since the start of the Syrian war in 2011.
Six million people still live in Syria, and they need humanitarian relief.
In Mualem's words, the regime of Syria greets the people of the devastated country who help them rebuild.
But it was stressed that it would not receive assistance from countries with fruit drops to support the rebellion.
The European team won in the Paris Leyder Cup.
The Led Cup was held at the National Golf Field on the outskirts of Paris, France, and eventually the European team defeated the American team by a score of 16.5:10.5, with the European team winning the 2018 Led Cup.

The American star Phil Miklson did not perform well most of the time in this game, especially at the 16th and 3rd holes, when he opened the ball and lost to Francisco Morinelli.
Italy's golfer, Morinelli, has played well in these rounds, and since the 1979 rematch, he's a four-pointer who won five runs.
. . . . . . . . . . . . American player Jordan Spith lost the lowest-ranked Danish player in the European team, Tobyo Olison.
The world's first-ranked American player, Dustin Johnson, lost to British player Ian Paultt by 1:2, the last time he played in the Ryder Cup in Pault.
The Spanish player Sergio García competed in eight Leeds Cup games, with 25.5 points in total, becoming a big crowd in the Leeds Cup.
I don't usually shout, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
Good Thomas chose to trust me.
I'm so happy to have the trophy back.
Garcia was so excited to say after the European Cup came to the title, "I'm so happy to be able to help the team."
He passed the torch to his fellow man, John Ram, who won the Leyder Cup personal race on Sunday by 2:1 to the American golf legend, Tiger Woods.
The 23-year-old Ram said, "I've won Tag Woods, and I'm so proud that she's with me to grow up."
In four games in France, Woods lost four runs, and currently in the Ryder Cup, he's 13 out of 21 and 3 flats.
This amazing figure, one of the sharpest players in history, has won 14 championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.

The team's performance was disappointing, and American team captain Jim Florrick said, "They're working hard, I'm proud of them."
There was a time when we put pressure on Europe.
We canceled.
I'm paying tribute to Thomas.
She's a pretty sharp captain.
They're all doing well for 12 players.
We'll regroup and we'll work with the American Professional Golf Players Association and the Bury Laid Cup Commission to move forward together.
I really appreciate that 12 players can be captains, and I'm honored.
You're going to take your hat down and pay her homage.
We're out of the game.
The Red Tide update: In Pinillas County, Manati County, Sarasota's three regions have reduced their bare Tide intensity.
According to the latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the bare tide density of parts of Tampa Bay has generally decreased.
According to a report by the FWC, water phenomena of varying shapes have emerged in the districts of Pinilas County, Manati County, Sarasota, Charlotte County, and Collier County, which shows a decrease in the abundance of water.
The Red tide's water phenomenon expands from the northern part of Pinillas County to the southern part of Leeshire, extending about 130 miles of the coastal line.
It's about 10 miles off the shore of Hillsboro County, but it's less than it was in the previous week.
In Pasco County, the phenomenon of a red tide has also been discovered.
