Between 1 January and 15 March 2020, there was a rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of new coronavirus diseases in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (COVID-19).
The cumulative incidence of new coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom shows a similar trend, confirming that while different countries are at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly.
According to Italian experience, the State, hospitals and intensive care wards need to be better prepared to meet the surge in the number of COVID-19 patients, and the task of intensive care is particularly important.
On December 31, 2019, the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, reported a number of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause.
On 9 January 2020, the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control of China reported that the pathogen is a new type of coronavirus, now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been named coronavirus diseases (COVID-19).
The evidence so far indicates that about 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, i.e. respiratory infections associated with or not associated with pneumonia, and that most recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses towards serious illness and requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% progresses towards critical illness and requires intensive care.
The patient mortality rate in hospital due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the countries of the European/European Economic Area (European Union, EU/European Economic Area, EEA) and in the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to the province of Hubei, China.
We also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in the EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom between January 31 and March 15, 2020, to Italy.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Following China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded further, and the dynamics of the current COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to those of China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the magazine European Surveillance, published on March 5, 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe based on a case definition by WHO.
In EU/EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on January 24, 2020, with patients returning to Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries, as well as the United Kingdom, had detected COVID-19 cases, and from 31 December to 15 March 2019, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, of which Italy alone reported 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Accumulation and incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases reported by each country around the globe at 8:00 a.m. each day, which are available only from official sources, such as national health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
The data have been used to assess COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and the United Kingdom and to compare them with Italy.
We calculated the 14-day amplification cumulative incidence of each EU/EEA country and COVID-19 case during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020 as an indicator of the incidence of active COVID-19 cases in order to consider the natural pathology of COVID-19.
We also provided the total cumulative number of cases reported by each country as at 8:00 a.m. on 15 March 2020, and compared it to Italian data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 Trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The trend of 14-day transcribed cumulative morbidity in EU/EEA and COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom is generally consistent with that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For EU/EEA and the United Kingdom as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 has increased since around 21 February 2020 and then dramatically on 28 February (additional material).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported by Italy, but the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries, as well as in the United Kingdom, shows a similar increase (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020, compared to Italy.
It should be emphasized that, as of March 15, at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries, as well as the United Kingdom, have reported the total number of cases comparable to Italy in less than three weeks.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases reported by EU/EEA and the United Kingdom is rapidly increasing.
The observed COVID-19 cumulative incidence trends indicate that the epidemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
. Although countries are at different stages, national public health responses vary, cases may be defined differently in each country, and there are differences in the options used to select patients who must undergo COVID-19 confirmed testing — including additional testing — the same.
In early March 2020, according to doctors in the affected areas of Italy, about 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients need intensive care, while media reports indicate that hospitals and intensive care wards in these areas have reached maximum carrying capacity.
At the EU/EEA level, only 6% and 1% of COVID-19 cases are currently available for hospitalization/or admission to the intensive care ward, respectively (data are not shown).
However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner in order to supplement the current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of intensive care and medium-term care beds available in European countries varied widely, ranging from 29.2 sheets in Germany to 4.2 sheets in Portugal per 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (or 12.5 intensive care and medium-term care beds per 100,000 people in 2010 - 2011).
The sixth update of COVID-19 rapid risk assessment modeled the health-care capacity saturation and associated scenes and estimated the relationship between each EU/EEA country as well as in-patient COVID-19 patients and the risk & gt of exceeding the number of intensive care beds; 90%.
As cases have so far gathered in EU/EEA countries as well as in certain areas of UK, and hospitals and intensive care wards usually serve the population covered in the identified areas, it is best to provide information on cases and intensive care beds at the level of Standard Statistical Geographical Module 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the EU/EEA and the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom are developing rapidly.
Therefore, both the State, the hospital and the intensive care ward should be prepared to respond to the increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 patients who continue to spread in the community and who need medical care, especially intensive care, such as in the affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, positive and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 and requires a transition from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases, if not implemented earlier, may not allow policymakers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adjust the response.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
There is currently a short window of opportunity through which countries may further increase controls to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and ease pressure on health care systems.
Otherwise, other EU/EEA national health-care systems are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths and a major human disaster.

While COVID-19 is less serious and has lower mortality rates than SARS, it is more diffuse and affects more older people than young people and more men than women.
In view of the rapid increase in new corona pneumonia-related publications, this paper wishes to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly developing research topic.
We will present basic knowledge of the epidemiology, pathology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The spring of January 25, 2020, became an unprecedented and engraved memory of the Chinese, and the outbreak of a new type of viral disease forced all people to remain out of their homes throughout the holiday and for many weeks thereafter.
This virus is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and related diseases are known as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country, before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the globe.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in over 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases, of which more than 40,000 patients had been discharged and over 3,000 had died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 has become the "No. 1 public enemy" and that its threat may outweigh terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months since the first report on the separation of virus sequences from multiple patients on 7 January 2020, covering virals, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment.
The purpose of this paper is to summarize the progress of research in this emerging field of discipline.

We will also discuss the knowledge gained so far on the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some pressing issues that remain to be addressed.
In the past, the CoV has been thought to be a non-lethal pathogen in humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common cold 4.
But this century has already encountered two highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which erupted in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality rates.
Therefore, this COVID-19 outbreak is the third COV outbreak recorded in human history.
The city of Wuhan first reported several cases of pneumonia for unknown reasons to the National Health Council of China on 31 December 2019, as shown in figure 1,1.
seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the same time, the outbreak spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, an infection by medical personnel was reported, suggesting that there could be a human-transmitted phenomenon.
On January 23, Wuhan City sealed the city and closed all public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study of new corona pneumonia, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the South China Seafood Market, which was considered the starting point for infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO announced the outbreak as a "global health emergency".
At the time of the publication of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (figure 2 (Fig.2).
The final extent and severity of the outbreak has yet to be determined as a result of the rapid development of the epidemic.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study for 8,866 patients (including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients) provided an update of the epidemic, as shown below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
The SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting all age groups, but the main age group is 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons are over 50 years of age, with very few under 20 years of age, and only 14 infected persons are under 10 years of age.
The SARS-CoV-2 infected males (0.31 per 100,000) outnumber females (0.27 per 100,000).
The COVID-19 is primarily concentrated in the north of the lake and surrounding areas.
The COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic regeneration (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the time of mass population movements before the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent) for all patients.
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 are gender (male), age (60 years) and severe pneumonia.
The CoV is a large pack membrane virus subfamily that contains a single justice chain RNA.
They can be divided into four subdivisions, alpha, beta, gamma and zirconium, in which alpha-CoV and beta-CoV are known to infect humans.
The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV's packaged membrane glucose proteins (S) are combined with their cell receptor vascular tension conversion enzymes 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptide enzymes 4 (DPP4) and then membrane integration occurs.
The virus RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the replica of the virus genome, the genome RNA forms a viral cyst along with the membrane protein and the nucleotide shell protein, and then integrates with the membrane and releases the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
The results found that SARS-CoV-2 was a new type of beta-CoV, with genetic consistency in excess of 99.98 per cent of the 10 sequenced samples collected from the South China Seafood market in Wuhan, the initial site of the outbreak.

The SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in ultra thin slices of the epithelial surface of the human airway through the lens electron microscope.
The study found that the human ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
The S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are, however, less binding to the human ACE2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients with a lower degree of infection than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form new types of short proteins encoded by orf3b and secretion proteins encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain any known functional structure domain or base sequence.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported an all-length ACE2 frozen electron microscope (cryo-EM) with amino acid trans-shipment protein B0AT1 forming a complex, with a resolution of 2.9 Å.
They found that the complex had an open and closed composition, was assembled into a dichotomy, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could combine two S proteins, thus providing evidence of COV identification and infection.
The B0AT1 can be a drug screening target to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
It is well known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both originated in bats and spread to humans through fruit beavers and camels, respectively.

It is not clear, however, what intermediate host helps the virus to infect humans across the species barrier, and the route of its transmission is yet to be clarified.

According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, believe that, given the fact that one of the CoVs found in the pass through the mountain nails — a long kiss ant animal, often used for Chinese medicine — has a 99% gene homologity with SARS-CoV-2, it is considered that the passthrough is a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.
The 1% difference between the two genomes, however, remains a huge difference; therefore, concrete evidence is yet to be provided to provide decisive results (Fig.33).
The scientific nature of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.
The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro in a dry environment for 48 hours, at 20 °C and 40-50% humidity for up to 5 days.
The SARS-CoV-2 may be of a similar nature.
The SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be highly sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat — 56 °C 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents can be effective in the elimination of living viruses, but chlorine is bound not to be effective in the elimination of living viruses.
The general lack of human immunity against SARS-CoV-2 makes humans susceptible to this new type of virus.
At present, there are no detailed research reports on the SARS-CoV-2 immune response.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4.4).
In general, after invading the host, the virus is first identified by the host's inherent immune system through mode recognition of the receptor (PRR), including the C type condensation sample receptor, the Toll sample receptor (TLR), the NOD sample receptor (NLR) and the RIG-I sample receptor (RLR).
. . . . . . . . virus induces inflammation factors through different pathways, tree stuttering cell maturity, and I type disruptor (IFN) synthesis, which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the extinction of the viral antigen's macrophageal cells.
But, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help free the virus from immune response.
The adaptive immune response will soon join in the fight against the virus.
The T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in antiviral defence.
The CD4+T cell irritation B The cell produces a viral specific antibodies, while the CD8+T cell directly kills the cells infected by the virus.
Auxiliary T cells produce inflammation cell factors to help defend the above-mentioned cells.
But, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing the death of T cells.
Immunisation of body fluids, including patches — such as C3a and C5a — and antibodies, are also essential to resist viral infections.
For example, antibodies separated from recovered patients can be neutralized with MERS-CoV.
The excess reaction of the immune system, on the other hand, produces a large amount of free radicals locally, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, lead to multi-organ failure or even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a concentrated disease, is more likely to affect older people with multiple combinations, as well as pregnant women.

According to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan City, the average latent period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated at 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average latent period of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As noted above, a recent study shows that, according to the demographics of 8,866 cases, the latency period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust effective isolation times to the most accurate incubation period, so as to prevent the spread of the virus to others by people with asymptomatic infections.
As a matter of practice, a viral contacter or infected person usually needs to be isolated for 14 days.
Should the isolation be extended to 24 days?

Even if there is no lung image anomaly, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should undergo viral screening for early diagnosis.
A demographic study carried out in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% fever, 76% dried cough, 55% breathing difficulties, 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed air support.
A similar result has been reported in two recent studies on family congregation disorders and the spread of asymptomatic individuals leading to congregnation.
In contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also suffered from fever (98 per cent), dried cough (47 per cent) and breathing difficulties (55 per cent).
However, 80% of these patients need air support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which corresponds to MERS having higher lethality rates than COVID-19.
c) Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dried cough (29%-75%), breathing difficulties (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) have been shown to be the main symptoms, with about 14%-20% of patients requiring ventricular support.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 cases had been diagnosed globally, reaching 66,576, with a mortality rate of 2 per cent.
In contrast, as of November 2002, SARS had a mortality rate of 10 per cent in 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate for 2,494 confirmed cases was 37 per cent.
An early study reported that SARS-CoV-2 had R0 up to 6.47, 95% confidence compartments (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV had R0 only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 shows the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.
The above data show that SARS-CoV-2 is more diffuse than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, controlling SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
the same family, or from the same party or means of transport, such as cruise ships.
The patient usually has a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas in the last two weeks before the onset of the disease, or of close contact with the infected person or patient.

The number of patients during the early stages of the onset of the disease is normal or decreasing.
For example, white cell counts < 4×109/L — including lymphocytes < 1×109/L — have been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, rising levels of thylene aminotransferase and viral bloodemia.
Increased levels of liver and myosterase and myoglobin in the blood can be seen in some patients, and increased levels of blood C reaction protein and blood sank can be seen in most patients.
In heavy patients, blood fiber protein degradation products can be seen, D-diple levels rise and lymphocytes count decreases sexually.
The majority of COVID-19 patients can see chest image abnormalities, characterized by double-sided speckling shadows or lung grinding glass.
Atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are common in patients.
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and sexual fibrosis seriously damage the gas exchange.
The I- and II-type pulmonary pneumatic cell dysfunction reduces the level of the surfactant and increases surface tension, thus reducing lung expansion and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst chest image discovery usually occurs at the same time as the most serious of the diseases.
On February 18, 2020, COVID-19's first pathological analysis found pulmonary pulmonary epithelial cell decomposition, transparent membrane formation, mesolytic lymphocytes immersed and polynucleocytes, consistent with viral infections and the pathological performance of ARDS, and similar to SARS and MERS patients.

However, because of the high rate of pseudonegatives, which may accelerate the outbreak, China began to use clinical performance for diagnosis (rather than relying solely on RT-PCR) on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred during the diagnosis of SARS.

On 14 February 2020, the Zhang Feng team reported on a programme using CRIST-based SHERLOCK technology testing SARS-CoV-2 that did not require complex instruments, using a trial paper to detect concentrations in less than an hour from 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 viral copies per microlitre) synthetic SARS-CoV-2RNA segments.
If proven in clinical samples, then this new technology is expected to significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of diagnosis.
In the absence of experience in treating new types of CoV, doctors mainly support treatments for COVID-19 patients, while trying to use or proposing various treatments for other CoVs — such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV — and other viral diseases (table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments such as antivirals, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support for recovered patients.
Even suggested that blood plasma of recovered patients be used for treatment.
The pharmaceutical company is competing for the development of antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning, and may also express other ACE2 organs, such as gastrointestinal systems and kidneys, at a lower level.

A patient with severe respiratory symptoms must be supported by an external membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary by-pass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of regenerative infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ function are essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is well known that over-reactive immune systems in SARS and MERS patients can lead to cytokinesis storms.
The cellular factor storm is a form of systemic inflammation response characterized by the release of a range of cellular factors, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cellular factors induce immunocellular cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytofactor storms, especially in patients with severe illnesses.
The cortical steroids and beads are single-resistant — an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies — which have been used to treat cellular factor storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytofactor storms include: regulating T-cell-directed immune responses; blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK; Bonner vomiting single resistance; cellular factor signal transduction inhibitors 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
The steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants to treat SARS in order to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
However, large doses of steroids are not beneficial for severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.

Later, it was also shown that Redsway may inhibit other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gillid has provided the drug to China for two clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons, the results of which are expected.
In addition, the use of potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms has been recommended for Barrickttin, alpha-interferon, Lopinaway/Litonave and Libawayin.

The interaction between these treatments and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibody generation in recovered patients
The collection of blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases has a long history for the treatment of other patients with the same disease or for the protection of healthy individuals from infection.
In fact, recovered patients usually contain relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.
The antibody is an immunoglobin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other isophiles that can identify unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Based on this principle, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and then injected to 10 patients at risk.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, while decreasing inflammation and viral loads and increasing blood oxygen saturation.
However, before specific treatments can be developed, there is a need for validation and clarification to suggest methodologies that can be used on a large scale.
In addition, given the effects of treatment, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
The antibodies, for example, can overstimulate the immune response and cause the cytokinesis to release syndrome, a toxic reaction that can endanger life.
. Antibody concentrations in the blood are usually low, while plasma demand for the treatment of patients at risk is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
The more critical and practical approach, therefore, is to separate B cells from the body of the recovered patient and identify genetic passwords that encode effective antibodies, or to screen effective antibodies against proteins necessary for the virus.
In this way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
In China, the use of TCM for the treatment of multiple diseases has been in the history of thousands of years.

The majority of active ingredients are still unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their optimal combination.
At present, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from the severe phase due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, it has been found that venom-revenging capsules and serial flowering plague capsules are effective for COVID-19 treatment.
In several provinces of China, 87 per cent of patients use TCM treatment, in which the highest cure rates for COVID-19 patients are observed, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ningxia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while Hubei Province only uses TCM treatment for about 30 per cent of patients, with the lowest cure rate (13 per cent).

They found that the WM+TCM group had a mild recovery, that the time needed to disappear and stay in hospital was significantly shorter than the simple WM group.
Most impressively, the symptom rate of deterioration in the WM+TCM group (from light to heavy) is significantly lower than that of the simple WM group (7.4 per cent against 46.2 per cent), and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group is similarly lower than that of the simple WM group (8.8 per cent against 39 per cent).
Despite this, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM still require higher-quality contrast trials, greater scope and more centres to verify.
The mechanism by which TCM treatments or their combinations function and, where possible, their effective compositions will also be of concern.
The majority of patients suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 will be in great fear of this highly infectious or even lethal disease, and those isolated will feel bitter, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, oxygen deficiency and coughing, and adverse reactions from treatment, such as insomnia caused by cortisol, may increase anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychological responses were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychiatric symptoms, pretence and even suicide.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracking and segregation can increase anxiety and guilt about the effects of transmission, segregation and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.
The psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team to communicate clearly through regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic equipment and applications to avoid close contact.
An effective vaccine is essential to interrupt transmission chains from animal hosts and infected patients to susceptibility hosts, and is usually used as a complementary means of antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
The industry has made efforts to develop a vaccine based on S protein to produce long-term and effective intermediate antibodies and/or protective immunization against SARS-CoV.
The detoxification vaccine has been evaluated in the SARS Animal Model.
However, prior to the initiation of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the body of older persons and lethal attack models and their protective effect on co-infection of viral infections in humans and animals had not yet been determined.
It's probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.

The vaccination strategy for MERS, some of which have been evaluated in animal models, has been developed through the use of living viruses, DNA plasmids, viral carriers, nanoparticles, viral sample particles and recombinant protein substrates.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine for non-immunized individuals against SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current outbreak.
However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time required for vaccine development (average of 18 months) and the dynamic changes in the CoV.
As a new type of disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its complete clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually, with no after-effects.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 patients with severe illnesses have high rates of morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the establishment of a pre-natal model of the disease is essential for health-care institutions to determine the priority of services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect the prognosis or prognosis of COVID-19 patients (table 33):
age: age is the most important factor affecting SARS predictions, as is COVID-19.
In a study that includes 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurs mainly in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7 per cent are over 50 years of age.
A patient in need of intensive care is more likely to have basic syndrome and complications, and is significantly older than a patient in need of intensive care (the median age is 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting age as a preposterative factor in the end of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, more men than women infected SARS-CoV-2 (0.31 per 100,000 pairs of 0.27 per 100,000).
c) Mergers and complications: COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and heart disorder.
The heart event is also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2 positive cholesterol cells, which may lead to abnormal liver function in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age is closely related to underlying diseases and may affect each other.
The results of laboratory examinations are abnormal: C reaction proteins in the blood (CRP) levels reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and are considered diseases, treatment responses and potential pre-post-factors for eventual recovery.
The relevance of CRP levels to the magnitude of COVID-19 and the pre- and post-existing nature was also suggested.
In addition, the rise of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), Tian Winter aminotransferase (AST), propamate aminotransferase (ALT) and myo acid kinase (CK) may also help predict endings.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
main clinical symptoms: the temporal progress of chest imaging and clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues to predict the endings and complications of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressants, usually used as auxiliary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
As large doses of cortisol are widely used in patients with heavy SARS, many survivors suffer from ischaemic bone necrosis, leading to lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
So, if necessary, steroids should be used in the COVID-19 patients in small doses and short periods.
. Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients were under great stress, as they were often subjected to prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of relatives and patients.
It is important to provide psychological counselling and long-term support to help these patients escape stress and resume their lives.
The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from SARS based on demographic studies to date.
In addition to replicating within the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at an early stage of the infection, similar to other coVs that cause a common cold.
Thus, during the early or incubated period of the infection, a large number of viruses will be produced in the course of daily activities, causing great difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
The spread of SARS-CoV, however, is considered to have occurred when the patient's condition is severe, and most transmission does not occur at an early stage.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
China is currently making tremendous efforts, including the blockade of Wuhan and surrounding cities, and the continued segregation of almost all the population with a view to disrupting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have caused serious damage to the economy and other aspects of China, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the rate of development of the epidemic is slowing.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and that the drop phase will last 3-4 months.
Some other experts, however, are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more infectious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have developed models for predicting the consequences of the outbreak, arguing that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that 2 patients who recovered and were discharged before the week had detected SARS-CoV-2 in both mid-snacks and swabs, indicating that this newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to the flu.
However, with the reduction in the number of new cases, there have been encouraging signs in China that the current strategy may have worked.
The Ebola virus has been predicted to result in 1 million cases and 500,000 deaths.
However, through strict isolation, the disease is eventually controlled.
similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become less infectious, eventually disappearing or becoming a less pathogenic virus co-existing with the human body.
The following is a comparison of COVID-19 outbreaks with SARS and MERS (fig.55).
The SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and can be transmitted by coughing or sneezing, or even by direct contact with items contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, thus increasing the likelihood of dung transmission.
The most recent study, which included 138 cases, 41 per cent of cases may have been caused by intra-hospital infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Therefore, closer precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially medical personnel, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders who have had contact with the patient or the infected.
The first line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 dust masks (1860s series) help to control the spread of the virus.
. Surgery masks can prevent droplets from potential infected persons from spreading in the air or adhesive to the surface of items that may pass to others.
However, only N95 (1860s series) masks can prevent inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viruses can be fully penetrated; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, all about 85 nm.
As viral particles can even penetrate five stacked surgical masks, medical personnel who are in direct contact with the patient must wear a N95 (1860s series) mask, rather than a surgical mask.
. In addition to masks, medical personnel should wear isolation suits to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eyes.

Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent masks or goggles when facing a patient.
For the public in areas affected by or potentially affected by the outbreak, it is strongly recommended that all people wash their hands more frequently than usual using sterile soap, remain indoor self-segregated as much as possible, and limit contact with potential infected persons.
Three feet are thought to be the right distance for people to stay away from their patients.
These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 was entered into the human world as a new type of virus, based on a deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak, its high homogeneity with SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused high alertness in China.
However, until January 19, 2020, the Director of the Center for Disease Prevention and Control in Wuhan City was still pacifying citizens, saying that the new virus was less infectious, had a limited potential for human transmission and that the outbreak was preventable.
This news clearly eased public vigilance and was just missed as spring came and contained the outbreak at Wuhan's key node.
The disease control agencies in China may learn from this painful experience and make significant improvements in the future.
These bodies should, for example, (1) be more cautious when issuing bulletins, as each word is crucial to citizens and can change their attitudes and decision-making; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) contain potential outbreaks more strictly at an early stage than try to appease the public; and (4) conduct more frequent targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemics and regularly test and improve social response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months, it had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the globe.
As the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak looks like SARS re-emergence.
There are, however, some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
More older people than young people are affected by COVID-19, more men than women, and the severity and mortality of older patients is higher than that of young patients.
The SARS mortality rate is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
Even without symptoms, COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus only when the condition is severe, which makes it much more difficult to control COVID-19 transmission than SARS.
This part explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spread far more rapidly and widely than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2's conventional RNA test results may be negative.
On the other hand, the patient who has been cured may be turned to the sun again.
These findings significantly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.
Given the rapidness of research on COVID-19, the following key issues remain to be addressed:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?

What kind of animal is the transmission of the virus from the original host — hypothetically the bat — to the middle host of humans?
If we don't know the answers to questions 1 and 2, we won't be able to cut the transmission path effectively and the outbreak can be repeated at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical analyses have proven that SARS-CoV-2 is integrated with ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus still combine the cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
If there is no clear answer to these questions, we will not be able to achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this outbreak last?
How does the virus evolve during human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic? Will it disappear like SARS, or will it recur as regularly as the flu?
It is essential to find answers to the above and many other questions, but it may take a long time.

Before 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause minor diseases, such as common colds.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) reversed the situation, revealing the destructive and deadly nature of HCOV infection.
The SARS-CoV-2 that appeared in central China at the end of 2019 again made CoV a focus of attention, and it is surprising that it is more diffuse than its sister virus SARS-CoV, but has a low pathogenicity.
The HCoV infection is a co-infection of humans and animals, so it would be helpful for us to know the origin of the co-infection of humans and animals of HCoV.
The majority of HCoVs are from bats and are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate storage hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts is of direct importance for the prevention of human diseases.
The interaction of the CoV hosts in the study of animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the human CoV's morbidity mechanism.
In this overview, we outline the knowledge available on seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history, the origin and inter-species transmission of human and animal diseases.
Importantly, we compared and contrasted different HCoVs from the point of view of viral evolution and genome reorganisation.
In this context, we look at the current outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, the paper focuses on the requirements for the successful completion of the host conversion and the impact of viral evolution on the severity of the disease.
The CoV belongs to the coronavirus section and consists of a single chain of justice with a packaged membrane RNA virus.
These viruses possess the largest genome in the RNA virus, containing 2.6 to 32,000 bases, known as coronaviruses (CoVs) for coronaic forms under electron microscopes.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. About two thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab to replicate enzyme polypolymer proteins.
These polyproteins were further processed to produce 16 non-structured proteins, known as nsp1-16.
the rest of the genome contains the ORF of structural proteins, including puncture (S), pack membrane (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).

Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four subdivisions (α-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and zirconium-CoV), of which beta-CoV consists of most HCoVs and is subdivided into four spectrums (A, B, C and D).

For thousands of years, CoV has constantly crossed the species barrier, some of which have become important human pathogens.
To date, seven coronaviruses (HCoV) have been known to be infected with humans.
of which HCov-229E and HCov-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other 5 species of beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronary virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronary virus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause minor symptoms, such as common colds and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively larger number of patients, and are more likely to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome, ARDS) and extra-pulmonary performance.
In the mid-60s, the first HCoV-229E virus strain B814 was isolated from the nasal secretion of common cold patients.
Since then, humans have accumulated more relevant knowledge through extensive research on both HCov-229E and HCov-OC43 viruses that can cause self-restrictive symptoms.
In fact, prior to the SARS outbreak, the concept of infection with HCoV, which is usually harmless, was widely accepted.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating events in current history, with more than 8,000 infections and a crude disease death rate of about 10 per cent.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the outbreak continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to other parts of the world.
The new HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2), is the pathogen of the continuing prevalence of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which, as of March 3, 2020, has claimed over 3,120 lives and infected over 91,000 people.
The alarm has been sounded, and the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All 7 species HCoV have a common origin of disease among humans and animals from bats, rats or domestic animals.

In this overview, we outline the origins, inter-species transmission and morbidity mechanisms of HCov's human and animal ubiquitous diseases.
In particular, we have highlighted and explored a common topic, namely, that HCoV's progeny virus is not usually pathogenic in its natural storage host, but is pathogenic after transmission across species to a new host.
In addition, we have reviewed the trend towards the evolution of HCoV, in which the increase in transmission tends to be accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
In this context, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Since the 20th century, in the late 30s, the animal CoV has been widely known.

Over the past few decades, seven species of HCoV have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discoveries in chronological order (table 1) will provide us with a wealth of information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E strain was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infections and subsequently adapted to growth in the WI-38 pulmonary cell strain.
The patients infected with HCov-229E have headaches, sneezes, discomforts, larynx pains, common cold symptoms, and 10-20% have symptoms of fever, cough, etc.
In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the organ culture of the mammoth brain and subsequent successive generations.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E infection and do not differ significantly in symptoms from those of other respiratory pathogens (such as influenza A virus and sinus virus).
The HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, mainly during the winter spread of temperate climates.

A human volunteer study shows that healthy individuals infected with HCov-229E have mild common colds.
Only a few patients with low immune function show severe lower respiratory infections.
The SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first fully documented pandemic in human history caused by HCoV, whose pathogen is SARS-CoV, the third found HCoV.
The first SARS case dates back to Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002.
The SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, which spread to many countries and continents.
In addition to the superdispersor, it is estimated that each case may lead to about 2 cases of re-emergence, with a latent period of between 4 and 7 days, and a peak in viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
The patients infected with SARS-CoV were initially characterized by late symptoms such as myomenic pain, headaches, fever, discomfort and cold warfare, followed by respiratory difficulties, coughing and respiratory distress.
The reduction of lymphocytes, hepatofunctional abnormalities and the rise of myo acid kinases are unusual laboratory tests for SARS.
In addition, amphibious pulmonary pulmonary damage, epithelial cell proliferation and megaphageal cell growth were observed in SARS patients.
Then about 20-30% of patients needed intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
. In these cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including gastrointestinal tracts, livers and kidneys, may also be infected and usually accompanied by cytofactor storms, which may be fatal in patients with low immune function.
The virus was first isolated from an open pulmonary biopsy of a relative of a source patient who went to Hong Kong in Guangzhou.
Since then, people have devoted themselves to HCOV research.
The HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.

) Among the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, snout inflammation, conjunctivitis, fever and fine bronchitis are common.
Another independent study showed that the same virus was isolated from the nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Even though the virus was discovered in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.
- HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive larynxitis (also known as Grub sexual larynxitis).
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and fine bronchitis.

Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide and can cause mild respiratory disease.
All four communities have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to undergo mutations that cause highly pathogenic diseases. But there are also accidents and unknown causes, such as a more toxic rare subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.

The MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old acute pneumonia and kidney failure patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
While most laboratory confirmed cases came from the Middle East, input cases were reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary transmission to close contacts.
In 2015, there was another outbreak of regenerative transmission in Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.

In contrast to SARS, many MERS patients also suffer from acute kidney failure, a unique feature of MERS in diseases caused by HCoV to date.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, the reported laboratory confirmed over 2,500 cases, with a high rate of death of 34.4 per cent, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
In mid-December 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, patients with concentrated pneumonia were found, and retrospective analysis confirmed to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has announced that the continuing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health emergency of international concern and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases had been diagnosed globally, with a crude disease death rate of 3.4 per cent.
It is worth noting that the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the death rate in areas outside Hubei is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory infections in the form of fever, coughing and breathing difficulties.
Some of the patients also suffer from diarrhoea.

The reported occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections may accelerate the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
The comparison and contrasting of SARS-CoV-2 with the other 6 HCoVs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period of the HCoV disease and the duration of the course of the disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend of the other 6 HCoVs.
The second, COVID-19 symptoms are between SARS-CoV and 4 community acquired HCOV (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
on the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection displays features that are more common in community access to HCOV infections, including non-specific, mild or even symptomatic manifestations.
On the other hand, a small number of serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV infections, albeit with a slightly lower proportion.
Thirdly, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of community acquisition HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 has at least as high diffusion as community access HCoV.
On the other hand, whether SARS-CoV-2's communicability, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, decreases after human transmission, remains to be verified.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in feces samples.
At least in some cases, whether SARS-CoV-2 dung-mouth transmission plays an important role, as in SARS-CoV, remains to be clarified in future studies.
In addition, it is important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community access HCoV.
However, characteristics such as the spread, pathogenicity and continued transmission from generation to generation of SARS-CoV-2 will have an important impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All 4 communities that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another point of view, humans have adapted well to these four types of HCoV.
In other words, both sides may have been survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
The HCoV, which causes a serious human disease, and those who suffer from a serious HCoV disease, have died.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts, the more people are infected, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, then its spread in humans will be difficult to stop through isolation or other infection control measures.

The SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 community acquisition HCoVs.
It is highly infectious, at least for the time being, as is the case with community access to HCoV.

It remains to be seen whether it can be fully adapted to humans and recycle within humans without host or intermediate animal host.
The definition and characteristics of the evolution host, natural host, storage host, intermediate host and extended host of HCoV are of some guidance to us before discussing the animal origin of HCoV.
If an animal has a closely related ancestor that is highly homologous at nucleotide sequence levels, the animal will become an evolutionary host for HCoV.

In the same way, storage hosts will carry HCoV on a long-term and sustained basis.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its progeny virus.

This intermediate host can act as a source of co-infection for humans and animals infected by allowing the virus to be copied briefly and then transmitted to humans to increase the scale of human infection, thus acting as a magnifying host.
If HCoV cannot maintain its spread within the intermediate host, terminal infections may occur.
On the contrary, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even create long-term locality.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural storage host.
The retrospective analysis of epidemiological data found that SARS' indexed cases had a history of contact with hunting animals.
The subsequent seropositive survey showed higher levels of immunoglobin G (IgG) in animal merchants against SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
In the live animal market, the fruit beaver (flower beaver) and a beaver cat were found to carry for the first time almost identical SARS-CoV samples to SARS-CoV viruses.
The fact that there is no further SARS report after the removal of all the fruit beavers in the market indirectly supports this view.
However, it was reported that the testing of SARS-CoV by farm fruit beavers in wild or uncontacted live animal markets was largely negative, suggesting that the beavers might be only intermediately magnifying the host, not the natural host of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that since 80% of the Guangzhou market has SARS-CoV antibodies in different animals, it cannot be ruled out that many small mammals may also act as hosts between SARS-CoV.
All these animals seem to be terminal hosts for SARS-CoV.
A subsequent study of SARS-CoV natural animal hosts found a closely related bat coronavirus, known as the daisy coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) associated with SARS, which survives in the Chinese daisy.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequences.
The virus and other bat coronavirus have 88-92% nucleotide sequence homogeneity with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept of bats as hosts to emerging human pathogens.
In addition, researchers identified a variety of SARS sample coronaviruses (SL-CoV) from bats, but no virus other than a designated WIV1 could be separated as a living virus.

The bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor dipeptide enzyme4 (DPP4) to invade the virus.
The RNA of MERS-CoV dependencies RNA polymerase sequences are closer in system development to the corresponding RNAs in bats β-CoV from Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV has only 87% nucleotide sequence homologity with its close relative bat CoV-HKU25.
Therefore, bats may not be direct storage hosts for MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-peak camels are positive for the MERS-CoV specificity and antibody serum, as are camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.

It is also important to note that in the camels of the experimental infection MERS-CoV, the symptoms are generally minor, but a large number of viruses have been observed to fall off.
It is worth noting that infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the faeces channel, which is also the main way for bats to distribute the virus.
The problem remains, however, because many MERS confirmed cases do not have a history of contact with camels before the symptoms appear, which may be attributed to humans or unknown means of transmission, including unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 with the bat CoV RAG13 separated from the mid-gills has a 96.2% nucleotide homologity.
. As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATTG13 is too large to determine intergenerational relationships.
In other words, unless almost the same bat coronary virus is discovered in the future, bats may not be a direct storage host for SARS-CoV-2.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should be associated with many of the original COVID-19 cases of wildlife species sold and slaughtered at the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, indicating that there may have been an animal-to-human transmission event.
A few recent studies based on macrogenomic sequencing suggest that an endangered small mammal known as mountain-crossing nails (Maley-crossing nails) may also carry ancestor β-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new mountain penetrating coronavirus genomes have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2.
But they're just as close to RAG13, about 90% homogenic at nucleotide sequence levels.
. In system development trees, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 sample virus subdivisions, one of which has a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with 97.4% amino acid sequence homologity.
In sharp contrast, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RATTG13 differs more, although the sequence homogeneity of the two entire genomes is higher.
An earlier study of diseased mountain armour also reported detection of viral overlaps from lung samples, with results similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study, which used different assembly methods and manual processing, obtained partial genome sequences that accounted for about 86.3 per cent of the entire genome of the virus.
We can't rule out mountain armour as one of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal hosts.
However, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is derived directly from the mountain armour due to differences in the beta-CoV sequence associated with the mountain-crossing armour SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RAG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV-2 associated with the pass-through nail SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, mountain-crossing nails and other mammals remains to be determined.
The highest sequence homologity has been found in the RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and Mountain Aperture, but SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RAG13 have the highest all-genomic sequence homologity.

As the driving force of evolution, the reorganization is widespread in beta-CoV.
The origin of the direct human and animal disease of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet settled.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, researchers have studied the origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.

The report states that the bat coronavirus known as ARRCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in the North American tricolour bats is closely related to HCoV-NL63.
The HCoV-229E, on the other hand, is genetically related to another bat coronavirus (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008) found in Ghana, while camels are also suspected of being hosts among them.
For the sake of clarity, figure 1 and table 2 summarize existing knowledge of the animal origins of known HCoVs.
The system development analysis provides evidence of the historical inter-species transmission events of HCoV.
Around 1890, when HCov-OC43 infects humans from livestock across species, there is a pandemic of respiratory infectious diseases.
The history of interspecies transmission in HCoV-229E is unknown.

Secondly, the bats associated with HCoV-229E α-CoV are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the camel α-CoV causes an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, no camels have been found in wildlife α-CoV.
Therefore, the possibility of the camel getting HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.

It is therefore not surprising that the bats spread HCov-229E directly to humans.
or, although the bat α-CoV acts as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, the camel and single-peaker may have spread the virus to the intermediate host of humans, which is exactly the same as the MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV gives a good account of the spread of the species from bats to single-peak camels and from single-peak camels to humans.

The role of mountain armour in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different from that of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, if any.
In particular, β-CoV is highly pathogenic in mountain armour.
They may be end hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, similar to fruit beavers in SARS-CoV.
In future studies, it is important to identify or exclude several possibilities for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats may be almost identical to SARS-CoV-2 storage hosts of associated viruses.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Second, the mountain armor may be one of the intermediate expansion hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 new invasion of the associated virus.
- Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and eating wild flavors.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be vulnerable to infection SARS-CoV-2.
There is a need for antibody investigation of domestic animals and wildlife.
. Thirdly, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 may be reorganised and adapted in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and mountain armour.
The study of the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
. In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus play an important role in facilitating coronavirus crossing interspecies barriers.
First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.
The rate of mutation of coronavirus is estimated to be "medium" to "high" compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, and according to the adaptation phase of coronavirus to new hosts, the average replacement rate per bit 2 is about 10-4 times per year.
The coronavirus has a proof-read activity nucleotide excise enzyme, and its deletion can cause very high variability and decay, or even a failure to survive.
The interesting thing is that Remdesivir, a known nucleotide analog, can inhibit coronavirus replication by inhibiting this nucleotide exterior cutase and RNA dependence RNA polymerase.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The rate of mutation of the coronavirus, however, is about 1 million times higher than its host.
Also, if coronavirus is not well adapted to the host, its mutation rate is usually high.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-peak camels.
Theoretically, genetic drift is unlikely to rapidly disable vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
. Second, the larger RNA genome in coronavirus has additional plasticity in genetic mutation and recombination modifications, thus increasing the likelihood of synergistic evolution between species, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions are appropriate.
. A large number of unique open reading boxes and protein functions that are encoded towards the genome 3' end provide evidence for this.
The third, coronavirus switches templates randomly and frequently through a unique "replicating selection" mechanism during the RNA replication process.

The highly homologous whole length and subgenome RNA can be reorganised to produce new coronaviruses.
The evidence of natural reorganisation of systems in animal coronae viruses such as HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and bats SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9 has been found.
Interaction with transmission-related viruses-hosts
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in addition to the three above-mentioned viral factors, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another key factor that affects inter-species transmission.
. This article is typical of the reorganization of SARS-CoV, which shows evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of humans and fruit beavers SARS-CoV separated strains, researchers believe that SARS-CoV can rapidly adapt to different hosts, particularly through mutation of S protein RBD.
Usually, RBDs in coronavirus S proteins interact with cellular receptors and are closely screened for host antibody reactions.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318th to 510th amino acids of the S1 segment, which binds to the human ACE2 and its coreceptors to allow the virus to enter.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to identify a variety of animal ACE2 receptors, including bats, fruit beavers, rats and beaver cats, thus spreading the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues separated from a strain of humans and beaver viruses have been observed in RBD, of which 4 are in the receptor binding base sequence that interacts with ACE2 receptors.
The presence of K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of the fruit beaver SARS-CoV may increase the affinity for the interaction of the fiber-fibre protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the replacement of these amino acids may be essential for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in unit S protein S1 is 30%, which means that its combination of S proteins and human ACE2 may have changed.
It is true that a frozen mirror study shows that the affinity of this union is 10 to 20 times higher than that between the human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It would also be useful to determine whether any other co-receptors are needed in SARS-CoV-2 diffusion.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In addition, there are many other HCov receptors, such as the aminopeptase N of HCov-229E and the 9-O-acetylated saliva acid of HCov-OC43.
They may also explain the successful adaptation of the above coronavirus to humans after transmission from animal hosts across species.
In addition to the cellular receptor, the results of the spread between the HCoV species are also influenced by other host dependence and restrictive factors.
The difference between these host proteins in humans and bats, single-peaker camels and rodents, among others, HCoV natural hosts may constitute an obstacle to inter-species transmission.
The HCoV must deny the host dependency factor and break the host's constraints in order to successfully achieve interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of viral-host interaction have yet to be identified and demonstrated.
The use of the latest CRISPR technology for an unbiased whole genome screening of the host dependency and restrictive factors of SARS-CoV-2 may yield results.
The emergence of a new type of HCoV: back to where it came from
The diversity of the bat coronavirus provides ample opportunity for the emergence of a new type of HCoV.
In this sense, the bat coronavirus acts as a gene bank for HCoV.

The acquisition or loss of a new protein encoded gene, for example, may completely alter the pattern of the virus.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, because of the separation of SARS-CoV-related bat viruses, it was found that they could encode different ORF8 proteins, and therefore the ORF8 was considered important for adaptation to humans.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide missing features of SARS-CoV were found in a separated strain of viruses.
This deficiency divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to be adaptive mutations that facilitate host conversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have been reorganised with alpha- and gamma-CoV spectrometry, in which a large number of smaller recombinant areas were found in RNA dependency RNA polymerases.
In nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14, reorganisation bits were also found.
In the same vein, studies have shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced interspectral reorganisation events, which occur in Saudi Arabia's single-peak camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reorganisation events have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs and other animal coronaviruses are reorganized in their non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may lead to accidental changes in the viral genome, which is likely due to mitigating the choice pressure imposed by the host immune system, etc. that the virus faces.
A case in point of these effects is that in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, the absence of binucleotides leads to the loss of the full length ORF4.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by the pressure of the storage host selection.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after the bat's infection with the coronavirus, no or only minor symptoms have been detected, indicating an adaptation between the coronavirus and the bat.
. . . . . . . . . from anatomy and physiology point of view, bats seem well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the bat-promoting response have effectively reduced pathological changes caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural lethal cell activity of bats is inhibited due to the positive regulation of inhibitive natural lethal cell receptors NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the main tissue compatibility complex I molecules.
Moreover, high-level active oxygen (ROS) produced by high metabolic activity of bats can inhibit coronavirus replication as well as influence proofreading through extra-nucleic nucleic acid slicing enzymes, thus providing a selective pressure on the viral strain to produce high pathogenicity when it enters a new host.
. More pathogenic coronavirus strains may also evolve by recombinant, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features to adapt to the host.
Therefore, it is no accident that three new types of HCov have emerged over the past two decades.
The coronavirus does not cause disease or minor symptoms in storage hosts such as bats and camels.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is why there are asymptomatic carriers and cases of severe human infection.
The serious symptoms are mainly due to over-activation of the immune response and cytofactor storms, so the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been decoupled from coronavirus replication.
The same strategy to unchain the immune response may have an active role in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So, at least at the early stages of the human SARS-CoV-2 infection, the use of type I disruptor should be beneficial.
In addition, the NLRP3 inflammation activity in bats is flawed.
Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 inhibition NLRP3 inflammation may be useful for treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general themes on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are derived.
While 95% nucleotide homologous bats β-CoV have been found with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronary virus that is 96% nucleotide homologous with SARS-CoV-2.

The discovery of mountain-crossing nails with SARS-CoV-2 apparently the same source β-CoV suggests that the pass-through nails may be one of the intermediate hosts, or the pass-through nail β-CoV may have contributed genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally manufactured.
As a result of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus has re-emerged as a focus of attention.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our awareness of the importance of the origin of the co-infection of HCoV humans and animals and of animal hosts in human transmission.

Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from contacts between humans and fruit beavers on the market, closing the market for wet goods and killing the beaver can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same token, given the discovery of multiple spectrometry of the β-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, the trajectories should be removed from the wet goods market in order to prevent the co-infection of human and animal diseases.
But whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through mountain mammal and other mammals remains to be studied further.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in single-peak camels for a long time.
These camels are important vehicles and the main source of meat, milk, leather and fur line products for the local population.
They are widely found in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, following the practice of the Chinese wildlife market to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In order to stop the re-emergence of MERS, a comprehensive initiative should be taken to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels, in conjunction with other infection control measures.
As we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new gene types may emerge, which in turn causes an outbreak.
The coronavirus, which is common to various humans and animals, circulates in wild environments.
In particular, there is a high diversity of bat coronaviruses with the potential for co-infection of humans and animals.
There are many opportunities for evolution and reorganisation of coronaviruses in these animals, leading to the future appearance of new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and/or deadly in humans.
In some parts of China, the culture of consumption of wildlife should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Following the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop better preparedness and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have existed on Earth for a long time.

In order to better understand the ecological conditions of coronavirus and its natural hosts, continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary, which will prove to be very useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.
All in all, the most effective way to prevent the co-infection of viral humans and animals is for humans to stay away from the ecological position of the natural host of the co-infection of the virus.
There are still several gaps in the mystery of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 human and animal diseases.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, then how humans come into contact with bats remains to be determined.
. Thirdly, if the third mammalian acts as a true intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and mountain-crossing nails.
Finally, because many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be undertaken.
In the case of bats, mountain nails or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or almost the same progeny virus as it is expected to be found in natural hosts in the future.
Further research in this area will reveal the path of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
Need to update the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 "Suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases"
On February 6, 2020, our team released the "Guide to Rapid Recommendations for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infections of the 2019 New Coronaic Virus (2019-nCoV), through which we provide experience and lessons learned for the global response to the epidemic.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), however, is a new type of disease, and based on ongoing research and clinical practice experience, our knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing; thus, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on the above-mentioned guidelines and provide updated "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" diagnostic criteria based on the latest COVID-19 diagnostic programme (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, 2019, a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) broke out and the disease has now been officially named the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was once named the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 type coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick-recommended guide and released the guide online to the journal Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
. . . . . . . . since its release it has attracted widespread attention.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) released a total of 7 editions of the "COVID-19 Clinical Program" between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have changed substantially.
Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou and others, who have proposed a simple scoring scheme based on their own clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our guide and valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We recognize and thank them for this important work.
However, their proposal also needs to be updated in the light of the latest COVID-19 diagnostic programme (pilot seventh edition) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the diagnosis of a suspected case requires a combination of an epidemiological historical feature with two clinical performances for a comprehensive analysis, and, in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, three clinical performances need to be met:
• Epidemiological history: (i) prior to the onset of the symptoms 14 days have a history of travel or residence in the communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other areas; (ii) contact history with SARS-CoV-2 infection cases (nuclear acid testing positive); (iii) contact history with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other communities reporting COVID-19 prior to the onset of the symptoms 14 days; (iv) contact history with concentrated confirmed cases (within 2 weeks of the onset of the symptoms, within a small range of 2 cases of heat and/or respiratory symptoms, such as home, office, school class, etc.)
c. Clinical performance: (1) symptoms of fever and/or respiratory tract; (2) visual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) total number of white cells in early onset is normal or decreasing, and lymphocytes count is reduced.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on a suspected case and have any of the following pathological or serobic evidence: (1) real-time PCR testing positive from SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity with known new coronavirus; (3) specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibody positive from the serum test against SARS-CoV-2; or SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to positive, or rising thorium four times higher than acute period.
As we can see, the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020) added real-time PCR nucleic acid detection in respiratory or blood specimens.
The fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions added blood specimen pathology tests; subsequent seventh editions added serum evidence.
These changes are based on the continuing work of researchers to study the best nucleic acid detection reagent box for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory specimens, including blood extraction, which increase the availability of different specimens and provide evidence for the inclusion of positive results of specific antibodies in the diagnostic criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of atypical symptoms and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
In addition, the scoring system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we want more direct evidence and call on readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend that reference be made to and follow the latest guidelines of the country in which the case is found.
Our team will also update our guide in time to help.
Bangladesh reported 5 new COVID-19 deaths, rising by 1 day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths that day.
This created a new high in the number of single-day deaths caused by the virus.
As of yesterday, 114 confirmed cases and 33 cases were cured after rest at home in infection records reported by the Bangladesh Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research Institute (IEDCR).
Accumulatively, 17 deaths.
. At an online press conference, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, head of IEDRR, stated that these deaths included four men and one woman.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic (pandemic) on 11 March.
A hospital official revealed to the local news media Anadolu Agency that one of the dead patients was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who had been treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridge, Obaidul Quader, announced via online video that the public transport stoppage would go beyond the original plan and be extended to Saturday this week.
The public transport stoppage began on March 26 and was originally scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
. Basic goods such as medical care, fuel and food are still available for normal transport.
On 8 March, two of Bangladesh's first recorded COVID-19 confirmed cases returned from Italy, and one of the other patients was the wife of one of the confirmed patients.
As of March 19, all three patients had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than a million infections worldwide
The data from Johns-Hopkins University show that the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections worldwide has exceeded 1 million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 deaths are related to diseases caused by coronavirus - COVID-19.
On the same day that the milestone occurred, Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first death in connection with the coronavirus.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization had reported 105,1635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 within 24 hours of 10 a.m. (0800 UTC) in central Europe time.
In the United States, over 244,000 coronavirus cases have been recorded, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News quotes Johns Hopkins University data report that on Wednesday, coronavirus infections killed more than 1,000 people in the United States.
All over the world, countries have announced stricter measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the date of the city until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians throughout the country would continue to be paid during the lockout until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 vote against.
The curfew in Al-Quds Al-Mukarramah and Medina was extended in Saudi Arabia and changed to a full-day curfew; previously, the curfew had only been in effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. at night.

Stores in Australia reduced the maximum number of toilet paper per transaction
on Sunday and Saturday night, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the maximum per deal toilet paper purchase cap for all their stores to two packs and one pack, respectively, nationwide.
The ALDI also introduced restrictions on the purchase of a package on Monday.
These restrictions are posted in the form of messages on the register or on Facebook pages posted to the chain.
. . . . . . . . . . . it was reported that buyers hoarded goods for fear of COVID-19 in case they needed to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the number of toilet paper purchases sent to the door to every single package.

. Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers were trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times made this difficult.
He expected production costs to rise as suppliers tried to meet demand, while preferential activities would decrease.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of the inventory, some stores would not be able to hold a special Wednesday event.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the University of Technology in Queensland, said that stores would be replenished every night.
He said that toilet paper was a large item and therefore had fewer stocks and, once sold out, would leave a huge shelf space, exacerbating the sense of shortage of supplies.
. . . . . . . . . . . . Coles and Woolworth's view is that if there are so many things on the shelf that commodities such as roller paper and handwashing fluid can [be bought] and in sufficient quantities, you may not be so panicy. . . Russell Zimmerman said to ABC News.
- Who Gives a Crap last Wednesday said they don't have any stocks.

The real estate website Domain.com reported that some real estate dealers would provide free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne due to the low number of auctions held by buyers on weekend breaks at the labor festival.
The NT News is a daily newspaper printed in Darwin City and contains an 8-page pamphlet in its Thursday edition, designed to be used as a toilet paper after cutting.

. Russell Zimmerman added that demand for other commodities was also high, including masks, handwashing fluids, drying goods, handwashing fluids and flour.
In the same vein, outside Australia, the UK Internet supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to 2 packs of 12 volumes per package on Sunday night.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 (a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) to be a pandemic.
While the term "epidemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease and not to the level of risk in a particular case, WHO notes the need to urge Governments to take measures:
"All countries/regions can still change the course of this pandemic.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
" We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of proliferation and severity and the alarming levels of inaction. "
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was "unprecedented".
He commented at CNN in February that " no respiratory virus other than influenza has been found to continue to spread worldwide after its emergence. "
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view and said, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by coronavirus before. "
He went on to say, "Also, we've never seen a pandemic of viruses that can be controlled before."
Before entering the new state of the pandemic, WHO identified this outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said that the outbreak "first and foremost, it is still deteriorating."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus outbreak is a continuing spread of 2019 new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was confirmed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and as an epidemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, 210 countries and territories around the world have cumulatively reported about 16.1 million COVID-19 cases, with about 97,000 deaths, and about 17,000 deaths.
Healing about 36.4 million people.
The rate of death from disease in China is about 4 per cent, while in various regions of the world it ranges from 0.08 per cent (New Zealand) to 13.04 per cent (Algeria).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing and agitation.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The incubation period from exposure to the patient to the onset of the disease ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually about 5 days.
There is currently no vaccine or special-acting anti-virus treatment program.
The clinical treatment focuses on patient support treatment. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, coughing to cover the mouth, maintaining safe distance from others, surveillance and self-segregation of persons suspected of infection.
National official agencies have taken response measures such as travel restrictions, segregation, curfews, workplace hazard control and closure of facilities.
The outbreak caused a severe global socio-economic impact, with sports, religions, political and cultural events delayed or cancelled, and panic shopping exacerbated a widespread supply shortage.
Global 193 countries and territories have introduced national or local suspensions, with about 99.4 per cent of primary and secondary and tertiary school students affected.
As a result of the dissemination of false viral information online, there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asian descent and appearance groups, as well as groups in regions with severe outbreaks.
However, reduced trips and the closure of heavy industries have led to a decrease in the air pollution index and a decrease in carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, the health department of Wuhan (Hubei Province) in China reported an unknown case of pneumonia and launched an investigation in early January 2020.
The majority of these cases are related to the wholesale market in the South China Sea, so the new coronavirus is considered to be a common disease among humans and animals.
The virus that triggered this outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, was a newly discovered virus that was closely related to bat coronavirus, the mountain coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The first patients found were confirmed to have had an outbreak on 1 December 2019 and had no apparent link to a number of cases from the China South Seafood market that emerged later.
Of this early batch of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were confirmed to be related to the South China Seafood Market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unconfirmed report that the first case may date back to November 17, 2019, when the patient was 55-year-old male, from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported a decline in new reported cases in China, but there was a sudden and large increase in new reported cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and for the first time the number of new cases outside China exceeded the national territory.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially cases of light disease.
As of February 26, there were relatively few reported adolescent cases, with only 2.4 per cent of young people aged 19 and under worldwide. Patrick Valance, the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser, estimated that about 60 per cent of the population needed to be infected with a new coronavirus in order to get effective group immunization.
The number of cases refers to the number of people who have been tested by COVID-19 and have confirmed that the results are positive under official programmes.
As of March 23, the proportion of the world ' s tested population was not more than 3 per cent, and many countries have also issued official policies for the non-detection of people with light diseases, including countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March noted that, as of 23 January, an estimated 86 per cent of COVID-19 infected persons in China had not been tested, and that these unrecorded infected persons were 79 per cent of recorded cases.
According to a statistical analysis published on March 30, the actual number of infections in Italy is significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
The basic number of COVID-19 infections (R0) was originally estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the Center for Disease Control in the United States showed that R0 could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients can recover.
The time between onset and death is 6-41 days, 14 of which are most common.
As of 10 April 2020, about 97,000 people had died in COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80% of deaths in China were among people over 60 years of age, and 75% of deaths were accompanied by underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official statistics on COVID-19 deaths usually refer to deaths with positive results of new coronavirus tests under official programmes.
The actual COVID-19 death toll may well exceed statistical data, as it may not include patients who have not been tested, such as those who died in their homes, nursing homes, etc.
According to partial data from Italy, the actual number of deaths during the outbreak was 4-5 times more than the number of deaths from new coronavirus pneumonia in official statistics.
The United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) A female spokesman has spoken out: "We know [the death toll published] is below the actual value," and anecdotal accounts of underestimation of U.S. data confirm this statement. underestimation occurs frequently in the area of epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. on January 9, 2020, Wuhan had the first confirmed Chinese death case.
The first death outside China occurred in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, more than 10 deaths each occurred outside China, Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories on all continents, except Antarctica, had reported deaths. There are several methods used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region, changing over time, and are influenced by population characteristics such as detection, quality of the health system, treatment programmes, onset of the first outbreak of the epidemic and age, gender and overall health status.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global rate of morbidity and mortality was 6.0 per cent (97,039,617,204).
The rates of death and death vary from region to region.
In China, the estimated rate of deaths due to disease fell from 17.3 per cent (1 January 2020 to 10 February 2002) to 0.7 per cent (patients suffering from disease after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), the former reflecting the percentage of deaths from disease as a percentage of confirmed deaths, and the latter reflecting the percentage of deaths from disease as a percentage of infections (including confirmed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-limited and follow the entire process of a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Many scholars have tried to calculate the above-mentioned data for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall infection mortality rate from the outbreak ranges from 0.1% to 0.39%.
The upper limit of the estimated value of this range is consistent with the first randomized test conducted by Germany on COVID-19 and a statistical analytical study to detect the effects on the estimated value of CFR.
The World Health Organization claims that the outbreak is manageable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and varies from region to region.
The Maciej Boni from Penn State University noted, "Uncontrolled, outbreaks of infectious diseases usually enter stagnation after existing hosts have exhausted, and then begin to slow down.
But at the moment it is almost impossible for us to reasonably predict when the point of abduction will appear. "
The Chinese government's senior medical adviser, Zhong Namshan, believes that "the end of the outbreak in June can be expected" if all countries mobilize to adopt the recommendations of the World Health Organization to take measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine, said that SARS-CoV-2 "could erupt repeatedly and last between one and two years."
The study led by Neil Ferguson at the Imperial Institute of Technology showed that "before the vaccine is put into operation (which may take 18 months or more)" it is important to take physical distance and other measures.
According to William Schaffner from the University of Vanderburg, "This coronavirus is very contagious and I think it is unlikely that it will disappear completely" and "may turn into a seasonal disease that erupts once a year."
The capacity to cause a re-emergence depends on the degree of immunity and mutation of the group.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some infected persons may not have symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent) and dried cough (68 per cent).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory fluid (single), loss of smell, agitation, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, coldness, vomiting, glaze, diarrhoea or haze. According to the World Health Organization, about one in six patients will turn to severe disease and have respiratory difficulties.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) lists breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden fuzzy consciousness, difficulty in awakening and facial or lip luminescence as urgent symptoms; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended.... The further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, infectious shock and death.
. Some infected persons may not be symptomatic and have no clinical performance, but the test results are positive, so researchers recommend close observation and examination of those close to the identified patient, excluding the possibility of infection.
China estimates that the rate of non-symptomatic infections varies from extremely low to 44 per cent.
The incubation period (the time interval between infection and onset) is generally 1-14 days; 5 days are most common. With regard to uncertainty, one example can be shown: the proportion of people with a loss of smell in COVID-19 patients was initially estimated at 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some details on the route of transmission of the disease are yet to be determined.
The disease is currently thought to be transmitted mainly through close contact and coughing, sneezing or foam produced when speaking; close contact refers to a interval of 1-2 metres (3-6 ft).
The study found that an unshielded cough could lead to the widest spread of foam 4.5 m (15 ft)- 8.2 m (15-27 ft).
It has also been suggested that the long stay in the air of the virus resulting from people talking may also lead to the spread of the virus. Although the virus cannot normally be transmitted through the air, people may also produce the foam when they exhale or speak.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may mistify the respiratory secretion, which in turn causes air to spread.
Also, if a person touches the contaminated surface (including the skin) of the virus and then touches the mouth of his eye and nose, it may also cause the virus to spread.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, but this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 dung transmission.The virus is the most infectious three days before the onset of the disease, but it is also infectious before and after the onset of the disease.
The positive results can be detected at the earliest three days before the onset of the disease, indicating that the new coronavirus is already infectious before symptoms are apparent.
In spite of the low number of cases of asymptomatics diagnosed in laboratories, the phenomenon of asymptomatic infections has been detected in some countries in the course of contact tracking investigations.
The European Center for Disease Control and Control (ECDC) states that while the spread of the new coronavirus is not yet entirely clear, it is generally 1 person who transmits 2-3 people.The duration of the virus's survival on the object's surface varies from hours to days.
In particular, the new coronavirus is known to survive for up to three days on plastics (polypropene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard and for up to four hours on copper.
However, its survival is also affected by humidity and temperature.... There are now cases of positive detection of pets and other animals COVID-19.
There is currently no evidence that animals will retransmit the virus to humans, but official British agencies still recommend that people wash their hands after they are exposed to animals, just as they are exposed to other surfaces that might be touched by the infected.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of virus that was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia in a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the relevant coronavirus in nature. Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with home soap, as soap can dissolve the virus's protective cyst. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
At present it is considered to be a common disease for humans and animals.
The genetic analysis shows that this coronavirus is genetically associated with beta coronavirus belonging to the Sarbecovirus subfamily (B zirconium) and the two bat source strain clusters.
The new coronavirus and the other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RATTG13) are 96% consistent at the whole genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found only one amino acid missing from some parts of the genome sequence between the virus in the mountain armour and the virus in the human body.
. As of the present whole genome comparison, there are at most 92% identical genetic material between the pass-through coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 and it is not sufficient to prove that the pass-through is the intermediate host.
If the virus is infected, it can be diagnosed on the basis of a preliminary diagnosis of symptoms, but ultimately it can only be diagnosed by reversible polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected secretion.
A PCR and CT comparison study in Wuhan shows that CT is clearly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific and that many imaging features overlap with other pneumonia and disease development processes.
As of March 2020, the American Radiation Society had recommended that "CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease. "
The World Health Organization has now published several nucleic acid detection programmes for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
The nucleic acid detection uses real-time reversal of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Both respiratory or blood samples can be used for detection.
The results can generally be obtained in a few hours to days.
In general, such tests are carried out through snout swabs and can also be carried out through swabs.... Many laboratories and companies are developing serotonic tests for antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests have been confirmed to be sufficiently accurate and have not yet been approved for widespread use.
In the United States, serology tests developed by Cellex have been approved for use only by certified laboratories in emergency situations.
The typical imaging features of the X-film and computer fault scans of patients (CT) include the asymmetrical and thoracicity of the outside grinding glass shadows.
The Italian Radiology Society is compiling an international online database on the image performance of confirmed cases.
c) Due to overlap with other viral infections (e.g. gland viruses), there is limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19 by images that have not been confirmed by PCR.
In a large study in China, comparing the chest CT results with the PCR results, it was found that although images are less specific to the identification of infections, detection is faster and more sensitive, so it could be considered as a screening tool in a popular area.
An artificially intelligent network of curled nerves has been developed, which can be used jointly with X-films and CTs to detect the image characteristics of the virus.
Measures to prevent the spread of disease include good hygiene practices, diligent hand washing, avoiding the use of paper towels to cover mouths and noses when hands are not washed directly to touch the eye and nose, coughing or sneezing, and throwing used paper towels directly into the trash can.
A suspected infected person should wear a medical surgical mask when entering a public place.
It is also recommended that measures be taken to maintain physical distance to prevent the spread of the virus.... Many Governments have limited or recommended avoiding travel to and from countries and regions affected by the outbreak when this is not necessary.
However, the virus has now reached a community transmission stage in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community, and some community residents have no way of knowing where or how they are infected.... Medical personnel who come into contact with persons suspected of infection should take standard precautions, contact preventive measures and eye protection.Tracking contacts is an important means for health regulators to identify sources of infection and prevent further transmission.
The Government's use of mobile location data for tracking purposes raised concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations, such as Amnesty International, issued statements calling for restrictions on such monitoring.
There are currently various mobile applications in use or proposals for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions with privacy protection features, such as the use of blue teeth to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
Once the user has been in close contact with the COVID-19 test positive patients, the user receives a message warning that the false statements against infection are spreading on a continuous basis; for example, washing the nose and washing the mouth with mouthwash is ineffective.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are actively developing it.
It is recommended that the spread of the disease be stopped through hand washing.
The U.S. CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds, especially before meals and after snoring, coughing or sneezing, when there is a visible stain on their hands, such as after the toilet.
This is because before a virus enters the human body, the use of home soap is sufficient to damage its protective cysts, thus acting as a killer of the virus.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) also suggested that if there was no soap and running water around, hands could be washed using alcohol-containing handwashing liquids with at least 60% alcohol content.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
A variety of solutions can be used to sterilise the surface of the object (which is effective within a minute of the stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorate, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% polyvinone iodine.
Other solutions (e.g., phenylzammonium chloride and chlorophyll glucose) are less effective.
U.S. CDC recommends that if a new type of coronavirus pneumonia is suspected or diagnosed at facilities such as offices or day care centres, all regions should be decontaminated, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and automatic teller machines used by patients.
The WHO recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with curved elbows or paper towels while coughing or sneezing and immediately dispose of all contaminated paper towels.
It is recommended that people suspected of infection wear medical surgical masks, as wearing masks can reduce the amount of foam that comes out of talking, sneezing and coughing, and reduce the distance of transmission.
The World Health Organization has issued a note on the occasion and method of use of masks.
The University of Leeds virusologist Stephen Griffin argued that "the wearing of masks reduces people's tendency to touch their faces, which are also a major source of infection when hand hygiene is not in place." In addition, it is recommended that those responsible for the care of people suspected of being infected wear masks.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthy populations should wear masks only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for caring for COVID-19 patients, although the organization also recognizes that wearing masks helps avoid face touching.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. China explicitly recommends that healthy citizens also wear one-time medical masks, especially when they are in close contact with others (within 1 m (3 ft)).
In Hong Kong, China, it is recommended that masks be worn when travelling on public transport or entering crowd-intensive sites.
The Thai health officials advise people to make their masks and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are strictly prohibited from wearing masks or from blocking mouths and noses into public places.
On March 16, Viet Nam required all people to wear masks in order to access public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria requires masks for all people to enter the grocery store.
Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, China, has produced 10 million masks since mid-March, and on April 1 began requiring masks to be worn on trains and inter-city buses.
. Panama requires masks to be worn outside, and recommends that residents who cannot buy masks be self-made.
The masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
The infection prevention and control measures relating to maintaining social distance (also known as physical distance) are designed to minimize close human-to-human contact and thus slow the spread of the disease.
measures include segregation; travel restrictions; suspension of schools, suspension of work and closure of stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.
. In terms of maintaining social distance, measures that individuals can take include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas, changing to non-contact greeting methods and maintaining physical distance with others.
Now, many governments have made it mandatory or recommended that areas affected by the outbreak remain socially distant.
With regard to the largest crowd mass, the initial recommendation of the U.S. government agencies and WHO was 250 (in areas without COVID-19 transmission) and then soon reduced to 50 and then to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older persons and groups suffering from basic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and impaired immune system are at higher risk of serious illness and complications. The German Center for Disease Control recommended that such populations in the epidemic area should not go out as far as possible.
The use of the phrase "to keep social distance" implies that people are completely isolated from society and that people are not encouraged to use other ways of maintaining human-to-human connections.... Some authorities have also issued guidelines on sexual health applicable during the pandemic.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It is recommended that COVID-19 identify patients and those suspected to be infected to be self-segregated at home.
A detailed description of the correct self-segregation has been published by health institutions.... Many governments have imposed or recommended self-segregation for all residents of the affected areas.
The toughest self-segregation instructions were also issued to high-risk populations.
If it is possible to contact a COVID-19 patient, or to have been to a country or area of widespread transmission in the recent past, self-segregation will be recommended from the time of last possible exposure to the virus 14 days.
c. Epidemic prevention and control strategies include containment/repression and mitigation.
The containment applies to the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of tracking and isolating the infected, while taking other infection prevention and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to other populations.
If it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, try to make the transition to mitigation: take measures to slow the spread of the disease and reduce the impact of the disease on the health system and society.
The containment and mitigation measures can be carried out simultaneously.
The inhibition requires more extreme precautions to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic regeneration to 1 below. Part of the effort to control the outbreak of infectious diseases is to try to reduce the peak of the outbreak, which is the leveling epidemiological curve as we know it.
This reduces the risk of collapse in health service systems and buys more time for the development of vaccines and treatment programmes.
Non-pharmacological interventions that can control the epidemic include personal preventive measures, such as keeping hands healthy, wearing masks and self-segregation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspensions and the elimination of mass rallies; community actions aimed at encouraging acceptance of and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures, such as surface cleaning.... In the face of a clearly increased outbreak, China immediately took stricter outbreak containment measures, such as sealing the city and imposing a strict travel ban.
Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. Singapore provides financial support for self-segregated infections and imposes a large fine on those who refuse to segregate themselves.
In Taiwan, China, masks have increased production and penalties have been imposed on providers of medical supplies sold at stake. Simulations in the United Kingdom and the United States show that both mitigation (preventing but not preventing the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the spread of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
The best mitigation policy may reduce peak medical needs by 2/3 and halve the number of deaths, but it will still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths, causing a breakdown of the health system.
The inhibition may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus stops spreading in the population (or until the vaccine is introduced, whichever is first possible), otherwise the spread will bounce quickly once the relaxation measures are relaxed.
The long-term interventions aimed at curbing the pandemic have social and economic costs.
No special effects antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development is ongoing, including testing of existing drugs.
Take non-prescribed cold medicine, rehydration and rest may help to relieve symptoms.
depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, vein infusion and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may lead to a deterioration of the situation.
A number of compounds previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied to determine their applicability to treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also noted that some "traditional and family therapy" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization notes that improving processing capacity and adjusting the medical system to meet COVID-19 patient needs is the basic response to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospital and primary health care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating selective procedures where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and improving intensive care capacity by training personnel and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
The speculations about the origin of the first case (the so-called Patient Zero) are mixed.
The first known case of new coronavirus pneumonia may date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In a month, the number of new coronavirus cases in Hubei Province has gradually increased.
The majority of these patients were associated with the South China Sea fresh wholesale market, which also sold living animals, a theory that new coronaviruses were derived from some of them; or, in other words, from a combination of human and animal diseases. On 26 December, Zhang, a physician at the Midwest Medical Complex in Hubei Province, first discovered and received an unknown group of pneumonia patients and reported to the Center for Disease Prevention and Control in the Jianghan District of Wuhan City on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to a "coronary virus similar to SARS".
The eight doctors, including Lee Wenqian, were warned by the police for spreading the rumours, while another doctor, Eifen, was warned by his superiors for pulling the alarm.
The Wuhan City Board of Health and Health subsequently issued a bulletin on 31 December and reported to the World Health Organization.
The Wuhan health department, after receiving numerous undisclosed case reports of pneumonia, launched an investigation in early January. The number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days before the outbreak.
The virus spread to other provinces of China from early January to mid-January 2020, influenced by the large movement of Chinese spring population and Wuhan as a transportation hub and major railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases in one day, including 2 in Beijing and 1 in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data indicate that as of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States had confirmed more cases than China and Italy, making it the world's largest country. As of 9 April 2020, more than 161,000 confirmed cases had been reported globally; more than 97,000 deaths and over 364,000 cases had been cured.
Some 200 countries and territories around the globe have reported confirmed cases.
As a result of the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen area have taken preventive measures to limit the free movement of people and establish border controls.
National responses include containment, such as segregation (also known as residency orders, local asylum orders or blockades) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were in some form of blockade, more than 50 million in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, there were 1.7 billion people in some form of blockade around the world, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later, about one third of the global population.
The first COVID-19 confirmed case dates back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report speculates that the first case dates back to November 17th.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang had discovered an unknown number of cases of pneumonia, which was reported by his hospital on December 27 to the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Jianghan District, Wuhan City.
On December 27, 2019, a group of SARS-like coronaviruses was found in a preliminary genetic test of a patient sample.
On December 31, the Wuhan City Board of Health and Health issued a communiqué calling for health care in the city of Wuhan.
The same day it was reported to the World Health Organization.
Following these notifications, several doctors in Wuhan city have been disciplined by the police for walking the outbreak of the rumours.
The National Health Council of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical movement, and later, the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Xi Jinping, called it a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
On January 23, the government announced that a vaccination line had been set up in Wuhanla, prohibiting people from entering and leaving Wuhan, which was later extended to 15 other cities in the north of the lake, totalling about 57 million people affected, and was known as "the largest quarantine incident in human history."
The use of private cars is prohibited in the city.
In many places, the celebration of the Chinese New Year of the Agricultural Calendar (January 25) was cancelled.
The government department also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Fire Dynasty Hospital, which was completed for commission within 10 days.
. Another hospital, the Ray Shinyama Hospital, was subsequently built to receive more patients.
In addition to the construction of new hospitals, China converted 14 other venues in Wuhan, such as the Convention Centre and the Stadium, into square-class hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including the issuance of health declarations to travellers and the extension of spring holidays.
The national colleges and primary and secondary schools are also completely suspended.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions of China have also taken a number of measures, especially for primary and secondary schools and higher education institutions.
In China, telenovation measures have been introduced in many places.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The public transport was adjusted and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Many cities have introduced public activity facilities controls, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (over half of the population) are subject to some form of outdoor activity restrictions. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "inputed" from other countries and regions.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day compulsory isolation on all extraterritorial entrants. Within five days before March 23, there was only one indigenous case in mainland China, which was spread by a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of indigenous cases had largely been contained and that the Chinese epidemic had been brought under control.
On the same day, the area of Hubei, other than Wuhan, began to liberalize travel restrictions after a complete two months of the blockade. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced on 26 March 2020 that, as of 28 March, the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas, residence permits had been suspended and that no details had been disclosed as to when the policy had ended.
People who want to enter China are required to apply for a visa from the Chinese Embassy or Consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to resume work on 30 March and provided them with a monetary stimulus scheme. The State Council announced that April 4 would be a national day of mourning and launched a three-minute national memorial at 10:00 on that day. This day coincided with the festival of Qingming, when the central government advocated for families to pay a joint tribute through the network to their deceased loved ones in order to keep physical distance and avoid the second outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak.
On January 20, 2020, a COVID-19 confirmed case appeared in Korea.
The Korean health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, mainly as a result of a new religious movement rally in Daegu, South Korea, the Church of Jesus of the New Sky.
The New Sky believers who traveled from Wuhan to Daegu are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, of the 9,336 members of the church, 1,261, or about 13 per cent, reported symptoms. Korea announced its entry to the highest security level on 23 February 2020.
On February 28, Korea cumulatively reported more than 2,000 confirmed cases, increasing to 3,150 on February 29.
The virus results of three soldiers confirmed positive, and since then all South Korean military bases have been isolated.
The flight schedule has also been adjusted for the impact of the outbreak. Korea has launched what is considered the largest global scale, organizing the best viral prevention and control program, namely, viral screening of large populations, quarantine of all infected persons and tracking and isolating of persons in close contact with infected persons.
The screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new entrants from outside the country through mobile applications, free-out virus testing, which can be achieved the next day, while increasing detection capabilities to accommodate up to 20,000 people per day.
Despite the fact that there is no isolation of the entire city, South Korea's plans are considered successful in the prevention and control of the outbreak. Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude towards President Wen's crisis response.
Many Koreans signed the petition, some calling for impeachment, accusing the government of mishandling the outbreak, and others praising his coping strategy.
On March 23, it was reported that the minimum number of new cases on a single day since the occurrence of four weeks in Korea had increased.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all newly arrived overseas would be isolated for two weeks.
The media reported on April 1 that South Korea had received requests for assistance in the detection of viruses from 121 different countries and regions.
On 19 February, Iran announced that the first SARS-CoV-2 cases had been confirmed in Qum and that two patients had later died that day, according to the Iranian Ministry of Health.
The early measures announced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural activities, sports events and Friday prayers, the general suspension of universities, higher education institutions and primary and secondary schools.
Iran allocated 5 trillion rials to combat the virus.
On February 26, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani stated that there were no plans to block areas affected by the outbreak, but only to isolate infected individuals.
In March, Iran announced plans aimed at restricting inter-city travel, but inter-city traffic congestion continued until the new year in Persia.
The Shia holy places in the Qom area remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020 In February, Iran became the hub for transmission of the virus after China.
The extent of the outbreak in Iran is believed to have been masked by a number of parties, including the fact that, as of 28 February, the retroactive results of cases in more than a dozen countries had been directed to Iran, thus indicating that the actual outbreak in Iran was more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Government as of that date.
The Iranian parliament was forced to close down, and 23 of its 290 members were reported to have tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the unconditional release of human rights defenders detained for peacefully expressing dissent in Iranian prisons and the provisional release of all eligible prisoners.
The organization noted that the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, is at greater risk and that these institutions lack adequate health care measures.
On March 15, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number of single-day deaths reported by the country since the outbreak.
As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran had 50 new confirmed cases per hour and 1 new case of coronavirus death per 10 minutes.
According to World Health Organization officials, the actual number of cases in Iran may be five times higher than reported.
The view was also expressed that the United States sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial resources in responding to the outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the relaxation of economic sanctions in the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, two Chinese tourists were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome, and the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy.
This was followed by a sharp rise in the number of cases in the country, prompting the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Since February 21, when 16 cases were confirmed in Lombardy, a number of unrelated COVID-19 cases were discovered. 22 February, a cabinet meeting announced a new decree to contain the spread of the epidemic, including the isolation of more than 50,000 people in 11 different cities in northern Italy.
The Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conté, announced: "No access to the affected areas is permitted.
. On 4 March, as a result of 100 deaths in the country, the Italian government ordered a complete suspension of schools at all levels throughout the country.
All major sports events, including the Italian Football League One, will be held in a no-audience mode by April, but on March 9, all sports events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian Society for Anaesthesia and SIAARTI published recommendations on medical ethics for possible diversion programmes.
On 19 March, Italy reported 3,405 deaths from the pandemic, surpassing China and making it the country with the highest number of deaths from the new coronavirus worldwide.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Italy amounted to 128,948, deaths 15,887, cures 21,815, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.
The U.S. cable news network has reported that the twin factors of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to detect all people infected with the virus so far may be part of the cause of the high mortality rate.
The initial British response to the virus was considered to be one of the most relaxed of the affected countries. It was not until 18 March 2020 that the British Government began to impose various forms of social distance or mass isolation on its citizens.
As a result, the British government was criticized for its lack of speed and strength in responding to public concerns. On March 16, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending the cancellation of any non-essential trips and social contacts, suggesting that people should work as much as possible at home and avoid going to places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all leisure facilities, including bars and gymnasiums, should be closed as soon as possible, and committed to a maximum of 80 per cent of workers' wages, a maximum of £2,500 per month, to prevent unemployment in the context of the crisis. 23 March, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced stricter measures for maintaining social distance, prohibiting rallies between more than two people, and refrain from any travel and outdoor activity unless absolutely necessary.
In contrast to previous measures, this announced restriction is enforced by the police through fines and by dispersing the assembly.
. Most of the other businesses, except supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and garages, have been suspended.
The first COVID-19 confirmed case in the United States was found in January 20 in Washington, North Western Pacific, where the patient returned from Wuhan on January 15.
On January 29, the White House established a coronavirus task force.
On 31 January, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed entry restrictions on travellers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the U.S. Center for Disease Control (the leading public health agency under the U.S. Government) announced that it had developed its own testing reagent box.
Despite this, the United States has been slow to begin with detection, covering up the real situation of the outbreak at the time.
The Federal Government's reagent box produced in February was defective until the end of February, when the Federal Government approved the use of the non-governmental reagent box (from academia, companies and hospitals) until early March, when the test qualification restrictive criteria (which would require medical advice thereafter) were established, all of which led to the obstruction of pre-testing in the United States.
On February 27, the Washington Post reported that the total number of tests carried out by the United States was less than 4,000.
On March 13, The Atlantic reported that the total number of tests carried out by the United States was less than 14,000.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many patients with symptoms and medical orders waited hours or days to be tested." On February 29, after the state of Washington reported the first death in the United States, Governor Jay Insley immediately declared a state of emergency, and other states soon followed.
On March 3, Seattle Area schools were suspended. In mid-March, schools at all levels across the country were completely suspended. On March 6, 2020, some epidemiologists at Imperial College London gave predictive advice on the impact of the new coronavirus on the United States.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Crown Virus Prevention and Response Supplementary Appropriations Act, which provided federal agencies with $8.3 billion in emergency funding to respond to the outbreak.
. . . . . . enterprises impose travel restrictions on employees, cancel meetings and encourage employees to work at home.
. On March 11, Trump announced that a 30-day travel ban would be imposed on most European countries except the United Kingdom from March 13 onwards.
The next day, Trump extended the restrictions to include the United Kingdom and Ireland.
On March 13, Trump declared a state of emergency and began to use federal funds to respond to the outbreak crisis.
Since March 15, many businesses across the United States have closed or shortened their business hours with a view to mitigating the spread of the virus.
As of March 17, confirmed cases had been reported in 50 states throughout the United States and in the District of Columbia. On March 23, it was reported that the number of confirmed cases of new coronavirus in New York City reached 10,700, exceeding the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the Governor of New York said that maintaining social distance seemed to have begun to work, with the case doubling interval valuation extending from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in New York City stood at 32,308, with 672 deaths due to the virus. On March 26, it was reported that the number of confirmed cases of new coronavirus infections in the United States exceeded that of any other country, including China and Italy. As of April 8, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the United States stood at 400,335 and died 12,841.

The general public endorsement of Trump's crisis-control measures has become polarized by partisan differences.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized the United States for relying on the import of key goods such as basic medical supplies from China.

The report notes that knowledge of COVID-19 is not sufficiently deep and that Australia will focus on border control and communication in its response to the epidemic.
On March 21, Australia declared a "state of emergency for human biosafety".
As a result of the effective segregation of public transport in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei, some countries and regions have planned to withdraw their nationals and diplomats residing in these areas, mainly through domestic charter flights and with the permission of the Chinese authorities.

The entrepreneur Mayun delivered 1.1 million reagent boxes, 6 million masks and 60,000 protective suits to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, which were distributed by the African Union.
Mayun later delivered another 5,000 test kits, 100,000 masks and 5 respirators to Panama.
In addition to this, Mayun donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and reagent boxes manufactured in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese-made reagent boxes for coronavirus testing with only 30 per cent accuracy, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unserviceable masks, which were believed to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China's assistance was widely welcomed in Latin America and parts of Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched an emergency support operation for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the area of outbreak prevention and control.
The World Health Organization has noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SAR outbreak and this crisis. In the SAR outbreak, Chinese authorities were accused of concealing the facts and impeding prevention and containment efforts, while in the current crisis, the central government "has begun to update the situation regularly before the New Year's holiday to avoid panic."
On 23 January, in response to the central government's decision to impose a seal on Wuhan, WHO representatives said that while it was "not a recommendation of the World Health Organization", it also "fully reflected the determination to contain the spread of the epidemic from the areas most affected by the epidemic" and called it an "unprecedented" public health initiative. On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the outbreak constituted an international concern for public health (PHEIC), the sixth international concern for public health incident since it was first introduced during the swine flu pandemic in 2009.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tandese, noted that the identification of public health emergencies of international concern was based on "global communication risks, especially to low- and middle-income countries with inadequate health systems".
In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tandese stated that "there is no reason to take measures to intervene unnecessarily in international travel and trade" and that "the World Trade Organization does not recommend restrictions on trade and mobility."
On 5 February, the World Health Organization called on the international community to contribute $675 million to support the strategic readiness of low-income countries, saying that there is an urgent need to support countries "that do not have a supporting system to test those infected with the virus."
In a further statement, Tandese declared that "the weakest link determines how strong we are" and urged the international community to "invest immediately, or else at greater cost in the future." On February 11, the World Health Organization identified the disease as COVID-19 at a press conference.
On the same day, Tandese stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Gutierrez, had agreed that "the United Nations will do its best to respond to the outbreak."
To this end, the United Nations launched the United Nations Crisis Management Group to coordinate the United Nations-wide response. The World Health Organization has stated that this would allow WHO to "focus on health responses, while other agencies can also use their expertise to address the wider social, economic and development impact of the epidemic."
On 14 February, a joint mission of China led by the World Health Organization was launched to field international and World Health Organization experts from China to help respond to home-grown outbreaks and assess "the severity and infectiousness of the disease" through seminars and meetings with key national agencies, and to assess "the impact of provincial and county responses, including the different situations in urban and rural areas." On 25 February, the World Health Organization announced that "a greater global effort should be made to prepare adequately for a possible coronavirus pandemic" and noted that, although it was too early to call a pandemic, countries should "enter the state of readiness."
In response to the growing outbreak in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission to the country to assess the situation. On 28 February, World Health Organization officials stated that the global risk level of the coronavirus outbreak had been increased from "high" to "high", which was also the highest alert and risk level of the assessment methodology.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, Executive Director, Health Emergency Project, World Health Organization, warned, "This is a real-life review of Governments around the world: sober up.
The virus may be approaching, please be prepared," and urge Governments to take the right response to avoid a "worst situation" around the globe.
Ryan further notes that the current data is not sufficient to allow public health officials to declare their entry into the global pandemic, which would mean that "we basically recognize that everyone on Earth may be exposed to the virus. "
On March 11, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of the new coronavirus constituted a global pandemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization has stated that "he is deeply concerned about the extent and extent of proliferation and inaction." The World Health Organization has been heavily criticized for its perceived mishandling of the global pandemic, including delays in declaring public health emergencies and classifying the virus as a global pandemic.
Some of the more strong voices of opposition included a petition requesting Tedros Adhanom, Director-General of the World Health Organization, to submit his resignation, which, as of 6 April, had been signed by 73.3 million people.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the need to respect the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Group notes that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions, and that the Government should assume this responsibility.
The group of experts stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be grounds for discrimination against particular groups.
The expert stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minors, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, groups living in extremely poor conditions, detainees and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are actively responding to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform aimed at providing timely and comprehensive information, views and recommendations on policy responses in countries around the world.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the effects of blockades and travel restrictions, this number centre has a national policy tracking system designed to help countries learn from each other and promote global collaboration to address the challenges of new coronaviruses.
As the pandemic initially erupted in Hubei Province, China, Michael Gough, Minister of Cabinet Office, United States, United Kingdom, and Eduardo Bosonaro, son of President Yail Bosonaro of Brazil, criticized the Chinese government for its approach.

According to some commentators, this was intended to avoid public discontent with the CCP General Secretary over the outbreak of the new coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials (e.g. Zhao Lijin) denied that the COVID-19 outbreak, previously acknowledged, had started in Wuhan and supported conspiracy theories that new coronavirus pneumonia originated in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trump once referred to the new coronavirus as the "China virus" or the "Wuhan virus", saying that China's "censorship system has increased the spread of the virus and made it the current global pandemic", which in turn has been perceived by some critics as a form of racial discrimination, and has "reversed concerns about the failure of its government to contain the virus."
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the United States Government outlining a communications strategy apparently sent by the National Security Council, which stated that "this is all connected to China.
We have been told in any way, including press conferences and television appearances, to spread this message as far as possible." Media such as "politicians", "foreign policy" and Bloomberg claim that China's assistance to an outbreak country is intended to promote its global influence.
The head of European Union foreign policy, Josep Borrell, warned that there was a "politico-political factor to compete for influence through good offices and "brilliant politics".
Borrel also stated that "China, unlike the United States, is a responsible and reliable partner. "
China also called on the United States to lift the sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and allegedly provided assistance to the latter two countries.
On April 3, Mayun's 100,000 masks donated to Cuba were blocked by United States sanctions.
The U.S. authorities were also accused of transferring aid sent to other countries to their home countries.
A masked dispute between Germany, Austria and Switzerland and other countries, such as the Czech Republic and Italy, has also been reported.
In addition, Turkey intercepted hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU for its insufficient support for Italy affected by the new coronavirus.
The Italian Ambassador to the European Union, Maurizio Massari, said, "Only China has responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity. "
On March 22, Russian President Putin, after a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Conte of Italy, arranged for Russian troops to send military doctors, special sterilization vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian News quoted an anonymous "high-ranking political official" as saying that 80% of Russia's aid was "almost useless for Italy".
The source accused Russia of launching a "politico-diplomatic" charismatic offensive.

Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical aid to the United States.
The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said, "[Putin], in providing assistance to his American colleagues, believes that once the United States manufacturers of medical equipment and materials return to production, they will make the necessary returns. "
The planned NATO "Defenseers 2020" military exercises in Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea are the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War, which will be reduced in size.
The Secretary-General of the nuclear disarmament movement, Kate Hudson, criticized the "Defenseist 2020" exercise: "In the face of a global public health crisis, the exercise endangers not only the lives of American and many European military personnel but also the inhabitants of the countries where the exercise took place. "The Iranian government was severely affected by the outbreak, with about 24 members of parliament and 15 other current or former politicians infected.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders requesting assistance. The letter stated that United States sanctions against Iran had made it difficult for Iran to gain access to international markets and made it difficult to combat the outbreak. The outbreak prompted calls for social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child health care, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Political analysts predict that the outbreak may have a negative impact on Donald Trump's ability to get re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Foreign relations between Japan and South Korea have also deteriorated due to the global pandemic.
The Republic of Korea subsequently criticized Japan's "sanitary measures are vague and passive" when it announced that everyone entering from Korea was subject to a two-week quarantine at a government-designated location.
The Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude towards President Wen's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed the petition, some calling for impeachment, accusing the government of mishandling the outbreak, and others praising his coping strategy....This pandemic prompted many countries to adopt emergency legislation as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this may lead the government to strengthen its control over power.
In Hungary, the Parliament voted in favour of Prime Minister Orbán Victor to rule indefinitely by decree, suspending Parliament and elections, and also punishing anyone who is found to have disseminated false information about the virus and government crisis management.
The multiple supply shortages can be attributed to the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which stems from increased equipment use, panic shopping, and disruptions in plant and logistics operations worldwide in response to the outbreak.
The U.S. Food and Drug Supervisory Authority issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of supply.
There is panic shopping in many places, leading to the clearing of essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water on shelves, resulting in a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry, in particular, has also been warning of delays in the delivery of electronic products.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tandese, said that the public's demand for personal protective equipment had increased 100 times.
This demand has led to a 20-fold increase in the price of such products over the usual peak and a delay in the supply of medical supplies of between 4 and 6 months.
The World Health Organization has warned that this will pose a threat to medical personnel.
In Australia, the pandemic provided new opportunities for surrogates to sell Australian products to China.
This activity resulted in a shortage of formula for some supermarket babies, which was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Although COVID-19 was very serious in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, there was no serious food shortage in either area.
The measures taken by China and Italy in response to the accumulation and illegal trade in key products have been very successful, avoiding serious food shortages, which are expected to occur in Europe and North America.
. Agricultural production in northern Italy has not fallen significantly, but industry representatives believe that prices may rise.
The clearing of food shelves is only temporary, even in Wuhan, where Chinese government officials have released pork reserves to guarantee adequate nutrition for the population.
There are similar legal provisions in Italy that require food producers to supply stocks in response to such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy has had an impact on China: a media report on March 16 states that, in the first two months of 2020, China ' s economy suffered a huge shock and retail sales plummeted by 20.5 per cent, as a result of government measures to contain the outbreak.
Since mainland China is the world's leading economic and manufacturing centre, the outbreak of the virus is seen as a major threat to global economic stability.

In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative impact of the outbreak on global economic growth could be greater than the extraordinary outbreak of 2002-2004.
An expert from Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the impact of the epidemic on the global supply chain would be over $300 billion and could last for up to two years.
It was reported that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was "in a difficult position" after a significant drop in oil prices as a result of falling demand from China.

The three indicators fell by 10% or more that week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but still maintains a negative outlook.
The public's concern about the new coronavirus caused the stock market to collapse again, with the largest drop occurring on March 16.
The recession is considered by many to be an approximate event.
The economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely and urgent measures taken by central banks and states.
The central bank reacted faster than the 2008 financial crisis.
As a result of the closure of public places such as travel bans, tourist attractions, and government recommendations to avoid the impact of travel, tourism has become one of the most affected industries.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . due to falling demand, many airlines cancelled flights, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Australian Airways, while British branch airline Flybe unfortunately collapsed.

The outbreak coincided with the spring run, which was originally an important tourist season, as a result of the China Spring holiday.
The national and local governments cancelled a series of events that would involve crowd gathering, including the annual spring festival, and private businesses closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland in Hong Kong.

Retail stores in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40 per cent.
The number of retail stores in North America and the Middle East declined by 50-60 per cent.
In addition, the outbreak led to a drop of 33-43 per cent in the March passenger flow ratio in the shopping centre in February.
The shopping centre operators around the world have taken additional measures, such as increasing sanitation facilities and installing heat scanners to measure shoppers' temperature, while also eliminating some activities. According to estimates by the United Nations Latin American Economic Commission, the recession caused by the pandemic could lead to 14 to 22 million more people living in extreme poverty in Latin America than in the absence of the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan outbreak, about 5 million people were unemployed in China.
There are nearly 300 million rural workers in China, many of whom are confined to their homes in inland provinces or to Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans were unemployed and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, a new coronavirus outbreak could lead to 47 million unemployed people in the United States and possibly 32 per cent unemployment. India's blockade has resulted in tens of millions (day-paid) of Indian migrant workers being unemployed.

In response to this situation, the parties have begun to make significant efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.The outbreak has also recently led to the forced cancellation of many religious services, major sports events and other social events (such as music festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion shows), and this negative impact will rapidly intensify.
The film industry was also hit by the announcement by the Vatican of the cancellation of the celebration of the Holy Week in Rome during the last week of the Christian Quarter fast.

On the Internet, numerous web-based memes focusing on new types of coronavirus spread, and at the time of the spread of uncertainty, many began to turn to humorous and distracted responses.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racial discrimination against Chinese, East Asian and people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Many countries and regions, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have seen incidents of fear, suspicion and hatred.
This February's numerous reports (when the majority of cases were still limited to China) documented the racist sentiments of different groups around the world towards the Chinese, arguing that the Chinese should be infected with the virus or accept so-called legitimate reprisals.
A number of African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
It is reported that many residents of Wuhan and Hubei regions suffer from geographical discrimination.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As the outbreak spread to other hot-spot countries, Italy became the first COVID-19 country in Europe, where populations from that country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Some citizens of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese entry into the country in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the topic #ChinaDontComeToJapan (Chinese don't come to Japan) was widely disseminated on Twitter.
The Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported that racial abuse and attacks were increasing.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, has been criticized for referring to the new coronavirus as a "China virus", and critics believe that its statements are racist and anti-Chinese.
The Ukrainian protesters attacked the bus from Wuhan to New Sanzari, which contained Ukrainian and foreign evacuees.
Students from north-eastern India (on the border with China) and attending major cities in India are also reported to have been harassed as a result of the outbreak of the new coronavirus.
The President of the Indian People ' s Party of West Bengal, Dilip Gosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature, "so God will take revenge on them."
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta as "mistakes." In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination against non-Chinese residents were also exacerbated by the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and should be targeted for "waste disposal".
Many newspapers with pay-walls removed the pay-wall restrictions for reports of some or all of the new coronaviruses.
A number of scientific publishers have publicly published a number of scientific papers related to the outbreak.
There are also scientists who choose to quickly share their findings on pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

c. 2019 Respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus laboratory detection methods include: detection of the existence of the virus and detection of antibodies after infection.
The RNA of a coronavirus can be detected by RT-PCR, and from this it is determined whether the virus exists in the sample.
This test is a specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
- Antibody testing (seroton tests) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
The antibody tests show how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with mild, unreported or non-symptomatic symptoms.
This test results can determine the exact death rate of the disease, as well as the level of group immunization among the population.
Because of the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country/region had been able to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, none of the countries/areas had tested more than 3 per cent of their population, and the number of tests completed varied greatly from country to country.
This disparity may also seriously affect reported case mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly overestimated.
The real-time irreversible polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection using a throat rinse is only possible if it is completed within the first week of the infection.

The RT-PCR test, which is carried out using a swab, can only be reliable if it is completed in the first week after the infection.
After that, the virus disappears in the throat, but continues to reproduce in the lungs.
The sample can be replaced with a deep respiratory extract obtained through a snorkel tube or can use a cough outlet (slugger) for an infected person tested in the second week after the infection.

. On January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed a test. On January 28, 2020, the Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical level, based on the PCR's SARS-CoV-2 test reagent box (PowerChek Coronavirus).
In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed 2019 new types of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panels to public health laboratories.
The early version of the test reagent box used three gene detection methods, one of which resulted in uncertainty of results due to reagent defects, while the Atlanta CDC had a detection bottleneck; this resulted in less than 100 average samples being successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The test, which contained two parts, was not found reliable until February 28, 2020, when the state and the local laboratory were allowed to begin testing.
This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Supervisory Authority on the basis of an emergency use authorization.
The LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing could be conducted nationwide from 5 March 2020.
The Quest Diagnostics similarly announced that a nationwide COVID-19 test would be available from March 9, 2020.
. Undeclared quantitative limits; sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing is the responsibility of the National Centre for Research in Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR) for development and production.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federation Health Supervisory Authority. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a reagent box that could detect COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for a testing method that could complete a large number of tests within 3.5 hours, thus realizing that a device could be tested about 4,128 times within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for testing using the Abbott m2000 system to Abbott Laboratories (EUA); the FDA had previously issued a similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, a test method for Cepheid, which required approximately 45 minutes, was similarly authorized for emergency use by the FDA.
The FDA has approved a method of testing using thermo-enhancement techniques such as nucleic acid in place of PCR.

There are currently about 18,000 such devices in the United States, and Abbott is expected to increase production so that 50,000 tests can be provided every day. Taiwan is developing a method of testing using monoclonic antibodies (specifically combined with new coronavirus nucleotide proteins (N proteins)) in the hope that it will be available within 15 to 20 minutes, as is the case with rapid influenza testing.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of the chest is small, while the performance of the CT [computer fault scan] may be clear, even before symptoms appear."
The typical features of CT include double lung multileaf grind glass, with outer-week asymmetrical and post-part cloth.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . as the disease progresses will develop the appearance of the thoracic membrane, the gravel road and the pulmonary real change.
A PCR and CT study comparing Wuhan (where the initial outbreak of the current pandemic occurred) shows that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but CT is less accurate and that many of its image characteristics overlap with other pneumonias and diseases.
As of March 2020, the American Institute of Radiation had recommended that "CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as a first-line detection tool for diagnosing COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDC has recommended the use of PCR for initial screening.
The partial immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections about 7 days after the onset of the symptoms to determine the immune status of the monitored population. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A high-throughput automated system in many clinical laboratories is capable of doing this, but its availability depends on the productivity of each system.
For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked through sequence samples, it is usually measured using an exterior blood sample.
In the case of PoCT, skin puncture is generally used to obtain a blood sample.
. On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved the testing methods declared by 29 entities, which are now able to distribute their anti-medical test kits.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, the testing reagent boxes of the Emmon Medical Experimental Diagnosis Shares and Epitope Diagnostics were approved in Europe, and these reagent boxes could be used to detect IgG and Iga antibodies in blood samples.
The detection capacity can detect hundreds of samples within hours, so on the determination of the virus RNA, it is much faster than traditional PCR measurements.
In general, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the infection begins. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the anti-medical test kits it purchased were sufficiently useful.
In Hong Kong, a mechanism is in place whereby a suspected patient can live in a home, "the emergency room provides the patient with a sample test tube", where the patient throws saliva into the tube and then sends the test tube back, with the result to be received later. The UK NHS announced that it is piloting a home-based testing programme for suspected cases, which will eliminate the risk that the patient will be infected with others while going to the hospital, and the risk that the patient will have to use the ambulance to decontaminate the ambulance after using the ambulance. In case of a non-offtake detection of COVID-19 suspected cases, medical professionals can take appropriate precautions to extract samples.
In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Doctors stated on March 2 that non-residential institutions had the capacity to conduct approximately 12,000 tests per day and had tested 10,700 in the previous week.
If the test is performed at the doctor's request, the cost is borne by the health insurance.
The Director of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany, said that Germany had a total detection capacity of 160,000 per week.
As of March 19, free-off testing had been provided in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany is not known, as only the number of people whose results were positive is reported.
An initial laboratory survey showed that as of the twelfth week of 2020, at least 483,295 samples had been tested (including within the twelfth week of 2020), and 33,491 (6.9 per cent) samples had been detected. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a methodology for the simultaneous testing of 64 patients' samples, i.e., aggregate samples, and conducted further detection only when the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, the Huai Gene (BGI) temporarily established a 2000 pymmetric emergency testing laboratory called Fire Eye, which became operational on February 5, 2020 and could handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
The laboratory was built under the supervision of the founder of the Great Chinese Gene, Wang, for five days, and modelling showed that if the above detection capability was not achieved, the number of cases in Hubei would be 47 per cent higher and the corresponding treatment quarantine costs would double.
Following Wuhan's laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately established fire-eye laboratories, which currently exist in 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, laboratory detection daily fluxes totalled 50,000 copies per day.Origami Assays released open source, multi-routing designs that allow COVID19 detection of up to 1122 patient samples by 93 measurements alone. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for automatic fluid removal.
As of March, the shortage and shortage of reagents has become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some of the initiators to explore a sample preparation programme involving heating the sample to 98 °C (208 °F) for up to 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on 31 March that new coronavirus testing had now been conducted for more of its population, more people than any other country, and that testing levels were being expanded to allow large numbers of people to be tested.
The way to achieve this detection capability is to use free-of-the-trough testing on the one hand, and to fund the Group 42 and the Chinese gene (based on its "Fire Eye" emergency detection laboratory in China) to establish high-throughput laboratories to respond to large-scale population detection needs.
The laboratory, built in 14 days and capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, was the first laboratory in the world to operate on such a scale outside China.
In China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States, different tests have been developed for various parts of the coronavirus gene mapping.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing test reagent boxes to send reagent boxes to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own reagent boxes.
Germany's approach was published on January 17, 2020; programmes developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States will be available after January 28, thus limiting United States detection capabilities. China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of testing reagent boxes early in the outbreak, and both countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient testing boxes to meet demand and health experts' suggestions for testing.

On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programmes as the best way to slow the development of COVID-19 epidemics. The widespread spread of the virus led to a very high demand for detection, which left hundreds of thousands of tests in private United States laboratories, and the availability of swabs and chemical reagents began to become tense.
In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test reagent box.
In the United States, the test reagent box developed by the CDC was "defective"; subsequently, the government removed bureaucratic obstacles to private laboratory testing. Spain purchased the test box from the Chinese company Shenzhen Erie Biotechnology Ltd., and found the test results inaccurate.
The company explained that the inaccurate results of the tests could have been caused by the incorrect collection of samples or the wrong use of the test reagent box.
The Spanish Cabinet stated that it had recovered the reagent box that returned the wrong result and replaced it with another reagent box provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China were incorrect. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China and the results were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that these testing boxes should be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey stated that the detection boxes purchased by Turkey from China were "very high error rates" and did not "put them into use." The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million testing boxes from China, which were declared unusable in April 2020.

The researchers working in the Italian city of Vò (the first COVID-19 patient to die in Italy) conducted two rounds of testing for a total of about 3,400 people, approximately 10 days apart.
About half of them tested positive and unsymptomatic, and all the cases found were isolated.
The new infections were completely eliminated by imposing travel restrictions on the community.
Through large-scale tracking of contacts, restriction of entry travel, detection and segregation, 2020 coronavirus transmission in Singapore is much slower than in other developed countries/regions, and Singapore has not taken extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
In Singapore, many activities were cancelled and on March 28, residents were advised to stay at home, but the school resumed on time on March 23 after the holiday.
Other countries/regions, such as Ireland and South Korea, have also managed to control the mass spread of disease through large-scale tracking of contacts, restriction of entry travel, detection and isolation, and less radical blockade measures.
A statistical study found that the lower the case mortality rate in the countries with the higher number of tests relative to the number of deaths, perhaps because those countries are better able to detect groups with only minor or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries with limited experience with COVID-19, which have no detection capacity and national laboratory processing, send their first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for validation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
In the chart below, the "test positive %" column is influenced by the testing policy of the country in which it is located.
In other cases under the same conditions, the positive detection rate is higher in countries that only test in-patients than in countries that test all citizens (whether or not symptoms appear).

In some "critical moments" of the day, the insistence on hand washing with soap prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be transmitted via feces-mouth.
If people do not wash their hands before they touch their own eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. visceral membranes), they may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common colds.
The five critical moments of the day in which you must wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after cleaning the children's hips or changing the urine tablets, before feeding the children, before eating, before treating food or before treating raw meat, fish or poultry.
In the absence of soap and water, the hand can be cleaned with grass and ash. The World Health Organization recommends that hands be washed in the following cases:
Before, during and after the preparation of the food.
Before and after taking care of the patient.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after replacing diapers or cleaning as the hips of a toilet child.
After snouting, coughing or sneezing.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The manual hygiene of medical personnel refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
The washing of hands before the onset of drugs or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
In the medical field, the main purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacterium, virus or other micro-organisms that can cause disease) and chemical substances that may cause harm to the human body or cause disease in the hands.

There are many health benefits from hand washing, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices have contributed slightly to the increase in the height of children under five.
In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by advocating simple behavioural changes (e.g., washing hands with soap).
This simple act can reduce the death rate from the above-mentioned disease by nearly 50%.
Promoting handwashing as an intervention can reduce the occurrence of about one third of diarrhoeal events, with the effect of providing clean water sources in low-income areas.
The use of soap to wash hands can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by 48 per cent.As a result of spontaneous behaviour by families, schools and communities around the world, hand washing with soap is the most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (Acute Respiratory Infections, ARI).
As a major acute respiratory infection, pneumonia is the primary cause of death among children under the age of five, with pneumonia taking the lives of about 1.8 million children every year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause a total of nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has stated that, compared to any single vaccine or medical intervention, turning handwashing with soap after meals and toilet can save more lives, reducing deaths from diarrhoea by almost half, and reducing deaths from acute respiratory infections by one quarter.
As part of the Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project, while advocating hand washing, other hygiene interventions are usually undertaken.

A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause skin itching, cracking, known as handweed rashes or hand skin inflammation, which is particularly common among medical staff.
The excessive frequency of hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of a compulsive disorder (OCD).
In order to reduce the spread of disease's feces-mouth, it is important to wash hands with soap at the five critical moments of the day: after toilet (defeating, defecating), after cleaning the children's hips (replacement of the urine tablet), before feeding the children, before meals and after treating food before and after treatment of raw meat, fish or raw meat.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, hands should also be washed in the correct manner in the following cases: handling the cut or wound before and after; after sneezing, coughing or slugging; after touching animal feces or treating animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries/regions, the proportion of hand washing with soap is very low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households used the practice of washing hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest percentage, reaching 97%; the United States was close to the average, or 77%; and China had the lowest percentage, or 23%. Now, in order to promote the practice of washing hands with soap at critical times, multiple methods of behavioural change have been put in place. For children to grow into hand washing habits, developing countries could choose to allow school children to set a daily collective hand washing.
The Basic Health Care Plan introduced by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and schooling.
At the heart of this national plan is deworming twice a year, supplemented by washing hands with soap and brushing teeth with fluorine toothpaste every day.
In Indonesia, the plan has also been successfully implemented.
Integrating soap or cleaning agents in water allows for better removal of skin microbes.
The main role of soap and cleaning agents is to reduce solubility barriers and improve solubility.
The use of water alone does not effectively clean the skin, as fat and proteins (parts of organic soil) are not soluble in water.
But cleaning hands requires reasonable water...
The solid soap, because it can be reused, may save bacteria left over from previous use.
A small number of studies investigated the diversion of bacteria from contaminated solid soap and concluded that bacteria could not be transferred, as bacteria would be washed out of foam.

The antibacterial soap has been heavily promoted among the healthy-conscious public.
So far, there is no evidence that antibiotic resistance microorganisms in nature have been selected using recommended antibacterial agents or disinfectants.
However, antibacterial soap contains a common antibacterial agent such as trichlorosal, which has a large strain of resistant microbes.
Therefore, even if antibacterial soap is not chosen for antibiotic resistance strains, antibacterial soap may not be as effective as propaganda.
In addition to surfactants and skin-paintants, complex formulations may also contain acids (acrylic acids, anti-fascin acids, lactic acids), anti-bacterial activity phenylacetic acids, and more skin modulators (gills, vitamins, mint alcohols, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health shows that common soaps have the same effect as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps with trichlor sand in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands.
It's comfortable to wash your hands with hot water, but it's not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
The bacteria breed very quickly under the body temperature (37 °C).

. Scientific research has confirmed that the use of warm water is not effective in reducing microorganisms on hand, contrary to the prevailing view.
The water-free handwashing fluid or the free-killing bacterium washing fluid is a non-water-based hand cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol hand cleaning agents (also known as alcohol scavengers, free from bacterium scavengers or free from baptisms) were popular.
. Most formulations of this type of handwashing fluid contain isopropanol or ethanol, adding additional densers such as capom (propylene polymers) to form gels, or adding pre-wetting agents such as glycerine to form liquids, or foaming in order to be easy to use, and to relieve alcohol-induced skin drying.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide can further increase anti-bacterial activity. At least 60% to 95% alcohol free-washing hand fluids can be effective in killing bacteria.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . can kill bacteria, polydrug-resistant bacteria (methoxysilin-resistant golden-yellow fungus (MRSA) and anti-VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory conjunctive virus (RSV), nasal virus, cow pox, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
The alcohol content of 70% of the alcohol hand fluid is used for 30 seconds to kill 99.97% of the bacteria in the hand (reduced 3.5 orders of magnitude, similar to 35 bells), and the scavenger can reduce the bacteria in the hand by 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 orders of magnitude) in a minute.
The alcohol handwashing fluid has little effect on viruses such as the norovirus, also known as the Novac, Norwalk. (the most common cause of infective gastrointestinal inflammation) ... It must be used enough free of baptism to fully moist or cover the hands.

The frequent use of alcohol free of washing hands fluid can cause the skin to dry unless a moistant and/or wetter is added to the formula.
. Glycerine and/or other skin morbids can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate alcohol-induced dry skin.
In clinical trials, alcohol free of washing hand fluids, which contains moistants, can significantly reduce skin irritation and skin drying compared to soap or antibacterial cleaners.

The water-free cleaning agent, while effective, does not remove the organic substance on hand, but only decontaminates it.
As a result, free washing of hand fluids is less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens than soap and water, as these are still on hand.
The efficacy of an alcohol-free handwashing fluid depends to a large extent on the composition and formulation, and its effects have traditionally been much worse than alcohol and alcohol scavenging fluid.
In recent times, formulations using benzo-ammonium have been shown to have sustained, cumulative antibacterial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have a reduced effect after repeated use, possibly due to the gradual onset of adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford soap and can use grass ash or earth instead.

One of the problems is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated by microorganisms, then the spread of disease may be accelerated rather than slowed.

The WHO suggests that, if soap is not available, it can be replaced by grass-wood ash or sand.
The steps recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of the disease are the following:
Wet your hands with flowing warm or cold water.
The recommended water flow is due to the possible contamination of the standing basin, which seems to have little to do with the temperature.

A thumb, wrist, area between fingers, and nail stitches are the most often neglected parts.
. Artificial nails and cracked nail oil may hide microbes.
The use of wet emulsion is usually recommended to avoid drying of the hand; drying of the skin can cause skin damage, thus increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
Where there is no access to running water and/or soap in developing countries, a variety of low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate hand washing, for example, through a hanging barrel or perforated platinum, and/or through the use of grass ash to wash hands (if necessary). In cases where water supplies are limited (for example, schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-efficient hand-washing programmes, such as simple taps and other low-cost ways, can be used.
The technique of simple taps is simple, hanging a water can with a rope, then pouring a small amount of water to the hand through a foot pedal and using soap.
The effective drying of hands is an important step in the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective way to dry hands in the public health room.
A growing number of studies have shown that paper towels are more hygienic than electric dryphones provided in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium in the paper towel industry, comparing paper towels, warm-winded dryphones and more modern jet dryphones with regard to hygiene.
. After washing hands, using a warm wind dryphone to dry your hands, it was found that the total amount of bacteria on the finger increased by an average of 194% and the total number of bacteria on the palms increased by an average of 254%.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether various dry hands methods could cause cross-infection between other bathroom users and bathroom facilities.
It is alleged that the jet stem phones ejected air at 180 metres/s (650 km/h; 400 miles per hour) and were able to blow away microbes on the hands and on the aircraft, thus potentially contaminating other bathroom users and bathroom facilities within 2 metres.
The use of a warm-winded dry phone can spread microbes beyond the stem phone 0.25 meters.
The results of the use of the paper towel dryer show that there will be no serious microbiology transmission.In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt carried out a study to assess different dryer methods.
The following changes in bacteria were observed after the dry hands:
The study involved many different dryphone producers, comparing these dryphones with dry hands with paper towels.

The alcohol free handwashing fluid should have an alcohol content of at least 60%.
Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, found in 1846 that hand washing was effective in preventing disease transmission in hospitals, however, it took a long time before medical personnel were forced to wash their hands.
The hospital uses electronic devices that provide feedback in order to alert hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
A study found that there was a decrease in infection rates following the use of these devices.
The medical personnel wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, using sufficient soap and water or gels to create foam and wash the various parts of their hands.
Hands and fingers are tied to each other.
If there is a residue between nail stitches, it can be cleared with a hard hair brush.

This prevents the re-pollution of the hand as a result of exposure to these surfaces.
In health care institutions, the purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and to avoid transmission.
The report in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that in most medical settings there are still cases where hand washing does not reach acceptable levels, and a large number of medical personnel often forget to wash their hands before they come into contact with the patient, leading to the spread of microorganisms.
A study has shown that proper hand washing, together with other simple procedures, can reduce blood flow infection rates associated with catheters by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a worksheet that demonstrates standard hand washing and hand washing methods in medical institutions.
The organization also published a draft manual health guide on its website for public comment.

If compliance with regulations needs to be confirmed, then commercial equipment can be measured and verified by the counterparty's health.
The World Health Organization suggested "Five Hours" to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluid
Before and after the sterile operation.
After caring for the patient... adding anti-bacterial chemicals to soap ("soap" or "anti-bacterial soap") can result in handwashing.
In an environment where there is either pre-operative or a large number of antibiotic resistant microorganisms, this bacterium-killing operation may be required. When the hands are "cleaned" for surgery, there must be water taps that can be opened and shut down without contact, hand-washing fluids that contain chlorine or iodine, sterile towels used to dry hands after washing hands, sterile brushes used for washing and other sterile tools for cleaning nails.
All the jewelry must be taken.
This procedure requires the cleaning of hands, forearm up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
It doesn't take a long time to baptize (10 minutes).
When flushing, it is important to prevent the water on the forearm from flowing back to the hand.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In order to reduce bacterial transmission, it is best to wash your hands before and after contact with the patient, or to use free bacterium washing fluid.
In order to control Gluccus infection in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands comes from the fact that when the frequency of hand washing reaches 20%, and when the frequency of cleaning hands increases to over 35%, further benefits are extremely limited.
In comparison with the use of antibacterial soap, the use of ordinary soap to wash hands can lead to a more than triple increase in the proportion of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food. After comparing the use of alcohol to hand washing with the use of antibacterial soap (30 seconds each), it was found that the use of alcohol to wash hands was 26 per cent lower than that of antibacterial soap.
But for reducing hand-to-hand type H1N1 influenza (HI1N1 influenza A) virus and inconvenient spruce (Clostridium difficile spores), soap and water are more effective than alcoholic scavenger fluids... The hand hygiene of medical institutions can be improved by training employees on how to wash their hands, increasing the supply of alcohol scavenging hand fluids, and providing written and oral reminders to employees.
The most effective interventions in a variety of medical settings require further study.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an important and cost-effective tool for achieving physical health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes universal handwashing a challenge.
In most rural African areas, for example, even where there is a cheap way to build a handwashing table, it is very rare to have a shampoo tap in the vicinity of every private bathroom or public health room.
The low frequency of hand washing, however, may also be due to deep-rooted habits, rather than due to a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating the use of soap for hand washing can influence policy development, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioural changes among residents.
If it is to be effective, it must be monitored and evaluated.
A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) community-based approaches were effective in increasing hand-washing rates, while social marketing activities were less effective. An example of a school-driven hand-washing approach, promoted by the United Nations Children's Fund, encouraged schools to take simple, cheap measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The handwashing promotion could include the construction of a handwashing table to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of handwashing awareness-raising activities is World Handwashing Day, aimed at trying to achieve behavioural change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promoted the use of a handwashing expression symbol.
few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing and the avoidance of disability adjustment life years (DALY) in developing countries.
However, reports indicate that it is more cost-effective to advocate hand washing with soap than other water and sanitation interventions.

At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by the odour known as venom.
The outbreak of food-borne diseases and medical-borne infections in the 1980s prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be more active in promoting hand hygiene, emphasizing that hand hygiene is an important way of preventing infection transmission.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap in order to protect people from such infectious diseases.
For example, Germany hangs the "Right Handwashing Method" poster next to a bathroom in a public health room, office building and airport bathroom.

In addition, those who can wash their hands after assuming immorality are less likely to engage in other "purified" compensatory actions, such as, for example, as volunteers.
The symbolic baptism of religion, which requires the washing of hands for sanitary and symbolic purposes. The symbolic baptism of washing hands with water but without soap, is part of many religious symbols, including the Bahai faith, Hinduism, bathing in Judaism (tevilah) and baptism (netilat yadayim) Clean baptism, baptism in Christianity and little purity in Islam. Religion also has sanitary hand baptism provisions, especially after certain acts.
. Hinduism, Judaism and Islam demand that hands be washed after the toilet, for example.
The Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews and Islam demand to wash their hands before and after eating.
COVID-19 Workplace Control
The COVID-19 workplace protection refers to the prevention of coronavirus diseases using occupational safety and health measures to protect against dangerous hazards 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriateness of workplace hazard prevention depends on the specific work site and task, and should be determined on the basis of the exposure source risk assessment, the severity of the community's disease and the risk factors of potentially exposed individuals exposed to COVID-19.
As required by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-level exposure to risk work has the least occupational contact with the public and other colleagues, and it is therefore recommended that basic infection prevention measures be taken, including diligent hand washing, encouragement of staff to stay indoors after illness, observance of breathing protocol and daily cleaning and sterilization of the work environment.
The moderate exposure risk work includes work that requires regular or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients, who may be infected as a result of continuous community transmission or international travel.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the group should ventilate using efficient air filters and sneeze protections, wearing personal protective equipment and other dangerous precautions when exposed to COVID-19 patients.
The OSHA believes that there is a high risk of exposure to medical personnel and ward staff who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients, and that exposure becomes extremely high if staff members perform aerosol-producing operations on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collect or process specimens from them.
The risk-control measures applicable to such persons include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilator rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their tasks.
The COVID-19 outbreak may have serious consequences in the workplace.
A staff member may be absent from work due to illness, needing to care for others or fear of exposure.
There may also be changes in business models, including changes in commodity demand, or changes in access to these goods (e.g. shopping during non-peak hours, or the use of distribution or off-duty delivery services).
Finally, product logistics from COVID-19 areas with severe outbreaks may be disrupted. Infectious disease prevention and response plans can be used to guide protection actions.
These plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplace and work tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from family and community environments, and risk factors for individual workers, such as older persons or groups with chronic diseases.
The plans also outline the precautions needed to deal with these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Infectious disease prevention and response plans may need to be subject to national or local advice.
The targets for responding to the outbreak include reducing staff-to-staff transmission, protecting populations at higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the response will be affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the enterprise is located.
The hazard control level is the widely used control framework in occupational safety and health, used to group hazard control measures according to effectiveness.
If the COVID-19 hazard cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
c) Engineering control means separating employees from work-related hazards, rather than relying on employee behaviour for control, which is also the least cost solution for implementation.
The administrative control refers to a change in the work policy or procedure, requiring the staff member or the employer to act on their own.
The personal protective equipment (PPE) has less of a defensive effect than engineering and administrative control, but helps to prevent some exposure.
all types of PPE are to be selected according to the level of risk to which the staff member is exposed, equipped according to applicable conditions (e.g. respirators), and must always be properly worn, checked and maintained regularly, and replaced if necessary, properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure to risk work has the least occupational exposure with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended that all workplaces adopt basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, home segregation of sick workers, observance of breathing etiquette when coughing or sneezing, provision of paper towels and trash cans, preparation for teleworking and, if necessary, mistops to work, discourage employees from using the tools and equipment of others, and maintenance of daily cleaning and disinfection in the workplace.
The timely identification and segregation of potentially infectious individuals is key to the protection of workplace people, customers, visitors and others.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees exhibiting acute respiratory symptoms should be housed in isolation for at least 24 hours, until it is determined that there is no fever, fever syndrome and any other symptoms, and that sick leave policies should be implemented flexibly, allowing employees to take care of sick family members at home and should be clearly informed of the policy.
According to OSHA, moderate risk exposure includes work requiring frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within 6 feet (1.8 m), but may cause individuals to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 as a result of continuous community transmission near the workplace or as a result of a possible recent arrival in the COVID-19 outbreak area.
Such staff include staff serving in schools, high-density work environments and some high-risk retail environments who will be exposed to the general public. Engineering controls for this group and high-risk groups include the installation of efficient air filters, improved ventilation, installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneeze protection devices and installation of off-duty windows to provide customer services. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups include encouraging residential segregation of sick employees, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing faulty shifts, eliminating non-essential trips to the COVID-19 outbreak site, developing emergency communications plans, including a forum to answer staff questions, providing staff with up-to-date education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviour, training staff in the use of protective clothing and protective equipment methods to use, providing resources and work environments that contribute to personal hygiene, requiring hands-washing, restricting the entry of customers and the public into the workplace, posting logos on hand washing and other COVID-19 protection measures. In accordance with specific tasks, staff members at least at risk are provided with personal protective equipment, including gloves, robes, masks or glasses.
It would be better for such staff to be equipped with respirators.
If a person is sick on the plane, appropriate precautions should be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including placing the patient at a distance of 6 feet from other passengers, assigning a crew member to serve the patient, providing the patient with a mask, or requiring the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with a paper towel while coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear one-time medical gloves when caring for sick travelers, touching body fluids or potential contaminated surfaces. If the sick traveler has symptoms such as fever, continuous coughing or breathing difficulties, the crew should also wear additional personal protective equipment.
The gloves and other disposable items should be treated in a biological hazard bag, followed by cleaning and sterilisation of contaminated surfaces. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard control measures also include delaying travel in the event of illness. If heat or other symptoms occur on board the ship, self-segregation and immediate notification of the ship's medical room should be made.
In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommends short-term closure of the respective schools and childcare facilities, complete cleaning or sterilization, regardless of the spread of the community, if the infected person has been present in the school.
For medium- and low-level community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of field visits, assembly and sports classes, choir classes or other large gatherings such as cafeteria meals, increased distance between desks, faulty arrival and departure, restricted non-essential visitor visits, and separate health offices for children with flu symptoms.
If community transmission is severe, in addition to the social distance strategy to be implemented, consideration may be given to extending the suspension time.... For law enforcement officers who perform routine routine routine activities, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control consider that they face a lower direct health risk.
It is recommended that law enforcement officials who have access to COVID-19 who have identified patients or suspected individuals should act at the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including with appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during the arrest, the staff member should clean and decontaminate his or her line of duty belts and equipment before using home cleaning spray or rag cleaning before using it, and should adhere to standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures and clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.
The OSHA considers certain health care and morgue staff to be at high or very high risk of exposure.
The high exposure risk staff includes medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff for physical contact with known or suspected COVID-19 infected persons.
The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if the staff performs a foam generation procedure for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collects or processes specimens of the infected or suspected infected.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The high exposure risk mortuary staff includes staff involved in the collation of the bodies of the deceased, who were diagnosed or suspected cases at birth as COVID-19; the risk of exposure is higher if an autopsy is performed. Additional engineering measures required for this risk group include isolation rooms for COVID-19 identification or suspected cases, including during the implementation of the flight-generation process.
A number of health care facilities and morgues can also be equipped with specialized negative pressure ventilation systems.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that different waiting areas be assigned to patients based on whether they are COVID-19 suspected cases. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration also recommends that persons working within 6 feet of the known or suspected infected SARS-CoV-2 and those carrying out the foam generation process wear respirators.
The United States requires the use of N95 filter masks or better masks approved by NIOSH in a comprehensive written respiratory protection program environment such as health testing, training, and medical examinations.
other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve staff comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective clothing, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluid.
The WHO recommends that the entry point screening staff wear only a medical surgical mask.
For staff who need to take breathing specimens from COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services to patients without having to perform the foam generation process, WHO recommends that they use medical surgical masks, goggles or masks, robes and gloves.
If you want to implement the foam generation program, you must replace the medical surgical mask with a N95 or FFP2 mask.
In view of the inadequate supply of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends reducing the demand for personal protective equipment through such measures as telemedicine, transparent windows and physical barriers as allowing only direct care personnel to enter the rooms of patients with COVID-19, only when a specific mission does require the use of personal protective equipment, continuing to use the same respirator when caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment and not encouraging the use of masks by non-asymptomatic personnel.

Since this month, we have encountered some difficult circumstances.
In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, we clearly feel the fate of all mankind, while recognizing our responsibility to each other.
The challenges we face are unprecedented, but we are well aware that the best measures to address them require a sense of solidarity, cooperation and community-building around the world, which is the core idea of Wikimedia.
The transmission of friendship and care between all colleagues through e-mails, telephone calls and chats is ample proof of the difference between our colleagues and how fortunate we are to be working with you.
I'm so grateful and proud to be a colleague with you.
Last week, some people expressed their appreciation for our work.
They made me realize how meaningful it is to be able to use Wikipedia in the world at this point in time, while also making me aware of the symbolic power that this vital resource has brought to people all over the world to maintain its proper functioning.
Either your job is to run the website, pay or community security, Wikimedia's normal operation is dependent on your hard work.
The current world needs more information than ever from Wikipedia.
At this stage, the content and even the way we work will have an important impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibility that colleagues have, we will make some important adjustments to our way of working together starting next week.
Adjustments to the working methods and timetable
As Robyn mentioned before, the executive team met last night to discuss the way the company works and the timetable for the next few days to the next few months.
At the meeting, we considered what we consider to be appropriate responses to the current challenges faced by companies, as well as best practices to ensure that companies maintain sustainable development during the outbreak.
The executive team agreed to ease pressure on the company's staff so that you could support the company's mission for a long time.
We support you in reducing the pressure of your work properly.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours a day (or 20 hours a week) and subsequent changes will be notified.
If you can work longer every day, we'll assign you a job based on the length of your work.
But, given the unpredictability of the current world situation, we will give priority to your personal needs, such as caring for your family, shopping or medical consultations.
We won't follow your work hours.
If you're sick, please drop your job.
It's self-evident, but we'd like to remind you, please, to rest assured.
You don't need to take sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team revise the work calendar and timetable to ensure that key areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan of Talent and Cultural Operations, which will support you and ensure that your situation receives proper attention from management.)
For hourly employees, we'll pay in full.
We have expressed our commitment and recommitted ourselves to honour the commitments made to the contractor and our hourly colleagues.
The salary we pay to all will continue to be calculated in accordance with the remuneration we receive for normal working hours under normal conditions.
Even if you're sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through their work, freeing up their pressure.
Our work can bring incredible returns, especially in times like this.
But taking care of yourself is still first.
We ask you to keep in touch with the manager so that we can keep abreast of your latest developments and adjust them accordingly.
priority is given to securing important work.
We have to keep some important jobs running properly.
The work of the website's reliability engineering team, the human resources operations team, the trust and security team and the fund-raising team (and other teams) is crucial and may require additional support.
We will begin to assess the current objectives with all sectors and shift our focus to supporting some of the matters that are essential to our mission.
All of us have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus on the most important projects.
The temporary slowdown will not affect future developments.
We don't intend to "exercise overtime" after the outbreak.
We won't ask you to work overtime to catch up, because it doesn't seem practical right now.
We accept that the current environment has changed, and we will set new goals and timetables, as appropriate.
What will be the changes in the APP (annual plan)?
In order to adapt to the new realities and day-to-day working hours requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 plan.
We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time to set the budget so that your staff can prioritize key tasks and take care of themselves and their families; and, at the same time, adjust the working arrangements for those who need or wish to reduce their workload in the coming weeks.
The extension of the timetable can significantly reduce the current planned workload and work pressure of the entire Organization.
We will present the above proposal to the Board next week. If the proposal is adopted, we will update the organization of the follow-up work with delegates and teams as soon as possible.
I thank the APP team for their leadership in the process.
Office conditions, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a San Francisco office colleague may have been exposed to COVID-19 virus.
But, for the sake of caution, we hired some anti-virus cleaners to completely decontaminate the San Francisco office.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The office building is fulfilling its duty of care agreement to use the corresponding product to secure the tenant.
We believe that when you decide to return to work, the office is well prepared to meet you.
Our Washington, D.C. office uses the WeWork office, which shares COVID-19 agreements with us and with all Washington, D.C. staff.
As of last week, the Washington, D.C. office has been converted to full-time remote work, in accordance with the guidance measures we shared with the San Francisco office.
At the same time, as some New York office colleagues already know, we have also been discussing issues related to the rental of office space in the Brooklyn area.
These discussions are continuing, but they may be delayed.
For the first time, some colleagues came into contact with the remote office.
Other long-distance colleagues would like to provide them with some suggestions for adjusting their working methods:
The meeting time should be kept within one to two hours.
If it takes longer, please consider spreading the content of the meeting to meetings of multiple dates.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
• Use videoconferencing as a default mode of meeting, while using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom for online collaboration and communication.
In each meeting, one of the facilitators is assigned to chair the meeting, one to monitor questions in the chat window and track changes in the list of speakers, and the other to help with the minutes (or in a multi-player collaborative manner).
If you need a comfortable headphone, send an e-mail to contact the technical support department.
Use your health allowance to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues
The Human Resources Operations Team is studying human engineering guidance in the form of webinars to help all of the Foundation colleagues to work more efficiently during distributed office hours.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editorial pine, before the outbreak was announced by WHO.
These requests for the cancellation of activities and other restrictions may result in those community recipients not being able to complete the intended contribution activities, and we have informed them that we understand this, while pledging that no one of them will be punished for postponing or modifying these goals.
In the next week, we will continue to provide further guidance at Wikimania and other regional community meetings and thematic community meetings.
The global community now seems to be enthralling in the grief caused by the devastation of the outbreak, but it also reflects the relief of being able to keep a clear eye on their respective communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT team will create a page on Meta-Wiki that will provide the community with a space to monitor impact and track community communication with us.
Contact to communicate COVID-19-related issues
We plan to hold a special staff meeting next week at 14:00 UTC/07:00 UTC, and we will send a related invitation to your calendar later.
At that meeting, we will share some updates, answer your questions and set aside some time for you to share your discussions.
We are united, here to help you.
At the same time, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this email and other important information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
The CRT team will update these pages in a timely manner and focus all the information on one place.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries/areas currently severely affected by the epidemic.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, major workflows or insurance, or need help from others, please contact and work with the CRT team at any time.
We are here to offer you the support and contacts you need.
If you have a security or sensitive issue, send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, head of the global human resources operations department.
While we are facing these changes, we cannot give up our work and obligations.
On the contrary, the outbreak has made us realize that we may need to adjust our work and obligations now in ways that have not happened in the past.
We believe that these measures are necessary to enable us to support each other in continuing to do their work, to provide the required support for our actions and to continue to bring services to the world on which they depend.
I'm not afraid of the challenge if I'm planning on it.
Now, please support each other in creating space for important work over the next few weeks or months.
We need all of you to contribute to this goal, so please take care of yourselves and your family in order to stay in the best position when needed.
Finally, please remember to wash your hands and not touch your faces.

The angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2, ACE2 is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, hearts, kidneys and intestinal tract.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of the associated angiotensin-converting Enzyme, ACE by reducing and increasing the levels of vascular stressors II. ACE2 is also expected to be a drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
The human source version of this enzyme is commonly referred to as hACE2.
The vascular stressin transformation enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of inner skin cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-end peptide enzyme M2 structural domain and a C-end Collectrin kidney amino acid trans-shipment protein structural domain.
The ACE2 is a monotonous I-type membrane protein whose enzyme active structural domain is exposed to the cell surface of the lungs and other organizations.
The other enzyme, known as the decomposition enzyme (sheddase), cracks the extracellular structural domain of ACE2 from the transfilm structure domain, resulting in soluble proteins released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted to urine.
The ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane, mainly pulmonary type II pulmonary cells, intestine epithelial cells of small intestines, arteries and veins of most organs, and arterial smoothing muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in cerebral cortex, texture, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to counterbalance ACE.
ACE to decipher angioplasm I cracks into angioplasm with vascular constrictive activity II.
The ACE2 follow-up crack vascular tension II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) phenylamino acid at the end of the aluminum acid and hydrolyze it to vascular stress (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
The ACE2 can also crack many other peptides, including defunct amino acid 9, eparine peptide (apelin), neurorepression, morphine peptide A and gastrophyllin.
The ACE2 can also regulate membrane transport of neutral amino acid trans-shipment protein SLC6A19 and is associated with Hana's disease (Hartnup).
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronaviruses into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (a virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (a virus that leads to COVID-19).
More specifically, S1 sting proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 are combined with the enzyme structure domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cell, leading to internal osmosis, resulting in the co-location of viruses and enzymes into the nucleus within the cell.
This entry process also requires host filamentase TMPRSS2 to initiate the activation of S proteins, and is currently studying whether inhibition of the process can be a potential treatment. Some speculate that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help to combat infection.

A systematic evaluation and analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group."
And, "For patients with higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with pawns and heart failure, the use of ACE inhibitors can also reduce the risk of pneumonia.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with reductions in pneumonia-related mortality, but the result is less reliable than reducing the overall risk of pneumonia. "
The reorganiser ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new method of treating acute lung damage, which appears to improve pulmonary blood flow mechanics indicators and blood oxygen saturation in piglets due to lipid polysugar.
The half-life of rhACE2 in the human body is about 10 hours, the starting time is 30 minutes, and the process of action (continuing time) is 24 hours.
A number of studies have shown that rhaCE2 may be a promising drug for patients with inhibitors who are intolerant or diseases with increased levels of vascular stress (renin-angiotensin system, BAS). rhaCE2 loss has been evaluated for the therapeutic effects of acute respiratory distress syndrome in clinical trials.
The b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, help track close contacts and identify individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with the infected.
Many applications have been developed or proposed by some regions and jurisdictions with the support of official governments.
A lot of the frameworks used to build close contact tracking applications have been established.
The issue of privacy has also attracted multiple attention, in particular the need for some systems to track the geographical location of application users.
The less invasive alternatives include the use of bluetooth signals to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate this function in support of Bluetooth applications directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government has jointly developed an application to support citizens in self-inspecting access to COVID-19 patients.
The program is now in use in more than 200 cities in China. Singapore has introduced an application called TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community and released as open source software and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia introduced a Bluetooth-based application, StopKorona!, which is used to track the exposure of potential infected people and help medical institutions to respond quickly.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication Technology and the Ministry of Health of North Macedonia.
As of April 14, 2020, the application is awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the Government announced that the Close Contact Tracker application was in an advanced stage of development and would be operational in the coming weeks. Ireland and France are also planning to launch a similar application ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar applications for Singapore-based TraceTogether applications and BlueTrace protocols. Russia plans to introduce a geographical fence application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow to ensure that patients do not leave their homes.
. Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering at the University of Cambridge, cited some practical problems that might exist with the application system, including false positive misreporting, and possible lack of effectiveness if only a small proportion of the population used the application.
In order to eliminate the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple places restrictions on the types of organizations that can release coronavirus-related applications in Apple app stores, i.e., only "official" or other well-known organizations.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The privacy defender stated that he was concerned about large-scale surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially if the surveillance infrastructure built to respond to the coronavirus outbreak should be dismantled after the threat of the outbreak had been eliminated.
Both Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
These organizations announced eight conditions to be met by government projects:
Surveillance must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
The monitoring and surveillance extension must have a "sunset" clause;
Data collected are limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there is evidence of effective protection;
Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing with third parties should be defined by law;
It is important to provide safeguards against data misuse and to provide citizens with the right to respond to data misuse;
All "relevant stakeholders" are required "to participate effectively", including public health experts and marginalized groups.... The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also issued verification lists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the issue of ongoing surveillance and remove it from the device operating system as soon as the tracking is no longer required.
Some countries have adopted web-based rather than application-based location tracking, and users do not need to download applications, while avoiding being followed.
In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
There may be serious privacy problems with web-based solutions that can access raw location data.
However, not all systems with their own central servers are required to access personal location data; many privacy protection systems that only communicate with one another using central servers have now been created (see below for more details).
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The system does not use specialized applications, but chooses to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combine this information to send notifications to potential infected people via text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the Government has been granted permission to make location information publicly available, as the information privacy laws have been significantly adjusted following the outbreak of the MERS outbreak in the country.
The public has access to this information through many applications and websites... and some countries (including Germany) are considering the use of centralized systems and privacy protection systems at the same time.
As of April 6, 2020, no specific details had been published.
. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy protection solutions, such as the use of bluetooth low power (BLE) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
The PEP-PT is a coordinated programme that contains a centralized and decentralized approach and is not a single agreement. Dispersion protocols include decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, originally referred to as contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols and mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT), etc.
According to these protocols, identifiable personal data will never leave the device, and all matches will be made on the device.
The privacy team at the MIT Media Lab has been developing the SafePaths platform, which will use privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or path-crossing data to track COVID-19.
The platform is based on the development of a white paper entitled "Application frightlessness: preserving personal privacy in an outbreak" released in March 2020. In addition to this, a company originally founded at the MIT Media Laboratory and dedicated to developing privacy technology, Enigma MPC, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.
The SafeTrace uses security hardware technology to support users in sharing sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, some groups joined forces to form the Global TCN Alliance around essentially the same approach and basic overlapping agreements, with the goal of reducing fragmentation information and supporting global interoperability of tracking and alarm applications, which is a key to achieving widespread application.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore Government announced that its official government application used the Open Source BlueTrace protocol.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control the Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced a close contact tracking plan, claiming that the plan combines Bluetooth low-power technology with privacy protection encryption technology to protect privacy.
In addition, they publish core technical norms used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be launched in three phases:
Launch of tools to support governments in creating official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
A direct integration of this feature into the iOS and Android systems, Google and Apple plans to launch the system first through an operational system update, and after the outbreak threat will also remove the system in the same way, thus addressing the follow-up surveillance problem.
. b Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, re-evaluation, redistribution or treatment conversion) is the conversion of an approved drug to other uses to treat a disease or medical condition different from its original research and development purpose.
This is a current scientific route for the development of safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and plasma transfusions during the recovery period. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be used in pharmaceuticals, with multiple conformational binding bits for each protein.
Analysis of these integration points provides a reasonable option for the development of effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include papaya sample protein enzyme, RNA dependency RNA polymerase, lyase, S protein and ADP ribosomal diphosphate enzyme.

According to the South China Morning Herald, Shinzo Abe has made a proposal to the Trump government to purchase the drug, which may be less effective in patients with severe diseases where the virus is already breeding.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or pre-pregnancy people to use the drug.
A study of the Lopinaway/Litonave (Kaletra) (a joint use of the antiviral drugs Lopinaway and Litonaway) concluded that "no benefits have been observed."
These drugs are aimed at inhibiting the replication of the human immuno-deficiency virus (Human Immunodescience Virus, HIV) by combining it with protein enzymes.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to fix the drug to find compounds that can be combined with SARS-CoV-2 protein enzymes. The scientific community has criticized the re-use of the resources devoted to drugs developed specifically for HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, AIDS).
The World Health Organization has included Lopinaway/Litonave in the international solidarity experiment.
The Redsyve is a drug created and developed by the Gilid Science Company to treat Ebola and Marburg virus infections.The Gilid Science Company subsequently found that Redsyve had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filamental viruses, pneumonia viruses, sub-adhesive viruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with anti-viral therapy is that drug resistance generated by mutation may lead to more severe disease and transmission.
A number of early pre-test studies suggest that Redsway may have higher resistance genetic barriers. Several clinical trials are currently under way, two of which are conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospital; one for patients with moderate symptoms and the other for patients with heavier symptoms.
Three vitamin C intravenous clinical trials are currently under way for COVID-19 patients with severe hospital conditions; two placebo contrast trials (China, Canada) and a non-control experiment (Italy).

The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
While there is no vaccine to complete the clinical trials, many attempts to develop such a vaccine are ongoing.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that a vaccine against this pathogenic virus SARS-CoV-2 was not expected to occur in 18 months.
In April, five candidate vaccines entered the I phase safety study.
In 2019, COVID-19 was discovered in December.
In 2020, a large-scale outbreak spread around the world, triggering a significant investment in and research activities for the development of vaccines.
Many organizations are using the released viral genome to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
The CEPI presented its vaccine development plan in April and stated that speed, productive capacity, large-scale deployment and global accessibility were the top priorities.
In April, scientists from CEPI reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were developing and developing effective COVID-19 vaccines.
The main platform targets for entering the I phase safety study include:
Nucleic Acid (DNA) and RNA (I phase developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vector (I stage developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, 5 gland virus carrier)
In April, CEPI scientists reported that a total of 115 candidate vaccines were in the early stages of development, of which 78 had been identified as ongoing projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and 37 had been announced but had little public information (presumably being planned or designed).
The I-II period test conducts preliminary safety and immunomorphic tests, usually random, placebo against multiple point tests, while determining a more precise and effective dose.
c) Phase III trials usually involve more participants, which include a control group, and test the effectiveness of vaccines against disease while monitoring adverse reactions at the best dose.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates actively developed (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated (which is still a "pre-clinical" study).
On or about January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that the potential of a molecular plier vaccine, which could be genetically modified for viral proteins to stimulate immune responses, was being studied.

The MRNA-based candidate vaccine BNT162 is currently in the pre-clinical test phase and is expected to begin clinical trials in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that they would receive pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and that its final candidate vaccine might start human trials in the fall.
On 19 March 2020, in France, the Alliance for Innovation in Epidemiology Prevention (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million to establish a coalition of COVID-19 vaccine research made up of the Bath Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which brought the total investment of CEPI in COVID-19 vaccine research and development to $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in COVID-19 vaccine research and development include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal trials of six different candidate vaccines.
The researchers at the Imperial Institute of Technology in London announced on March 20, 2020 that a self-expanding RNA vaccine for COVID-19 was being developed.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of the virus sequence released by China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced the allocation of $275 million to fund 96 medical response research projects targeting COVID-19, including numerous candidate vaccines from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the Saskatchewan University Plan.
At about the same time, the Government of Canada announced that $192 million would be dedicated to the development of COVID-19 vaccines and plans to establish a national "vaccination bank", including several new vaccines, to enable them to be put into service when coronavirus outbreaks occur again.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a test of PittCoVac, a possible COVID-19 vaccine for mice, and stated that "the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine provided by MNA can produce [rat] a strong antigen-specific antibody response, which began to appear two weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo, Canada, School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based candidate vaccine as a possible nasal spray.
The researchers, using the fungus, designed DNA to be replicated within human bacteria to produce harmless viral sample particles, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
In March 2020, the United States Government, industry and three universities centralized resources and combined cloud computing resources from Hewlett-Packard, Amazon, Microsoft and Google to access IBM's supercomputers.
c) Some vaccines have exotic effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that, in addition to preventing diseases, they can bring other benefits.
Further random trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health-care personnel.
The vaccine under development may be unsafe or ineffective.
Use of COVID-19 specific animal models, such as ACE2 genetically modified mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates to assess vaccine effectiveness, early studies suggest the need for biosafety 3 levels of containment for the treatment of living viruses and international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
A vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there are no SARS treatments or preventive vaccines that are effective for human security.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world.
At the time of the MERS epidemic, it was felt that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for the development of vaccines and treatments for MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine had completed the I-phase human clinical trial, and three other vaccines were under development, all viral carriers, the two being the ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac, and the one being the MVA carrier vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
. Various social media articles fuel conspiracy theories, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and that vaccines are already available.
The patents cited in various social media articles refer to existing patents for other coronaviruses (e.g. SARS coronavirus) strain gene sequences and vaccines.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing and agitation.
Other symptoms may include weakness, muscular acidic pain, diarrhoea, larvae, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The incubation period from exposure to the patient to the onset of the disease ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually about 5 days.

As of 17 April 2020, the total number of reported cases in 210 countries and territories worldwide exceeded 2.24 million, with more than 153,000 deaths.
There are currently more than 568,000 people recovering from treatment. Viruses are transmitted mainly between people through close contact, often by the sneezes that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In addition, if someone touches the contaminated surface of the virus and then touches his or her eye and nose, he or she may be infected with the virus.
The virus can survive on the surface of the object for up to 72 hours.
The most infectious three days before the onset of the disease are the standard diagnostic method for the real-time reversible polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of nose-swading.
It is recommended that those suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregiver wear masks.
The recommendations regarding the wearing of masks by the public vary from place to place, with some authorities opposing the wearing of masks and others asking to wear masks.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine or special effects antivirus treatment program.
The vast majority of countries in all six WHO regions have reported localized transmission of the disease.
The infected person may not have symptoms and may also have symptoms of suspected flu, such as fever, coughing, lack of strength and agitation.
Emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or hysteria, blurry consciousness, difficulty in awakening and hairy face or lips; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended.
The few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, running slugs or sore throats.
Quite a proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have also been monitored.
Some of the Chinese cases were initially characterized by only chest irritation and cardiac palsy.
Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia, multi-organ dysfunction, and even cause death.
We call this a lurking period.
c. COVID-19 is usually for 5-6 days, but may be extended to 2-14 days.
97.5% of infected persons have symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.The report states that not all infected persons have symptoms.
The role played by people with asymptomatic infections in the spread of the epidemic is not yet fully clear; however, prima facie evidence suggests that people with asymptomatic infections may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected without symptoms has not yet been determined and research is still being intensified.
The National Board of Health and Health of China has included symptoms-free cases in its daily reports since 1 April; of the 166 cases infected on that date, 130 (78 per cent) were non-symptomatic at the time of testing.
both saliva and saliva can carry a large number of viruses.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A study in Singapore found that an unsolved cough could lead to the widest spread of foam 4.5 metres (15 ft).
Although such viruses are not generally transmitted through air, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States has determined that they may be transmitted through bioaerosol, and air collectors outside the ward detect virus RNA positive samples.
. Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may mistify the respiratory secretion, which in turn causes air to spread.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but this risk is considered to be lower. When the patient has symptoms, the virus is the most infectious; although it may be transmitted before the onset of the symptoms, the risk is lower.
The European Center for Disease Control and Control (ECDC) states that while the spread of the new coronavirus is not yet entirely clear, it is generally 1 person who transmits 2-3 people.The duration of the virus's survival on the object's surface varies from hours to days.
In particular, the new coronavirus is known to survive one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastics (polypropene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours on 99% pure copper products.

If used correctly, soap and cleaning agents can also be used to kill the virus. Soap products can degrade the virus's fat protection layer, rendering it inactive, while also removing the virus from skin and other surfaces.
The effects of other solutions such as phenzammonium chloride and chlorophylogenate (a surgical sterilizer) are poor.A study in Hong Kong, China, shows that saliva samples were collected on average two days after admission to hospital.

The Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three patients with pneumonia in a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
This new SARS-CoV-2 virus presents all the characteristics of the virus in the context of the associated coronavirus in nature.

The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus converts enzyme 2 (ACE2) through vascular tension into the host cell, which has the highest content in lung Type II pulmonary bubble cells.
The virus binds to ACE2 and enters host cells through a special surface sugar protein called "stabbing" (scrotum).
Among patients admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, 12 per cent of infected persons found acute myocardial damage, with a higher proportion of patients with severe diseases.
The process of deterioration of the condition causes a general inflammation and immune system disorder, with a higher incidence of cardiovascular symptoms, but acute myocardial lesions may also be associated with a heart ACE2 receptor.
The ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in the heart and is involved in regulating the function of the heart.
The ICU-supervised COVID-19-infected thrombosis (31%) and vein thrombosis (25%) are known to have a higher incidence and may be associated with pre- and post-mortem malfeasance. COVID-19 Inquests of fatal patients have found diffuse pulmonary bubble damage (DAD) and see lymphocytes in the lungs inflammation.
Although SARS-COV-2 is addictive to ventral epithelial cells that express ACE2, COVID-19 patients with severe diseases have a full-body hyperinflammation response.
c) In particular, the collection of pathogenic GM-CSF secretion T cells in patients with COVID-19 is associated with inflammation IL-6 secretionary mononucleocytes and severe lung pathology.
The autopsy report also saw lymphocytes immersed.
The WHO has published several disease detection programmes.
The standard test method is the real-time reversal of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test usually detects a sample of the respiratory tract obtained through a snout swab; however, a snout or slurry sample can also be used.
In general, the results can be obtained in a few hours to two days.
The blood test can also be performed, but the two blood samples are required to be taken at intervals of two weeks, and the results are of virtually no immediate value.
. Chinese scientists have been able to separate coronavirus strains and publish gene sequences so that laboratories around the world independently develop polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to detect reagents and, in turn, detect if they are infected with the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (not only active infections can be detected, but also whether an individual has been infected with the virus in the past) is still under development, but has not yet been replicated.
According to Chinese experience, detection accuracy is only 60 to 70 per cent.
On March 21, 2020, the United States FDA approved its first instant diagnostic reagent and became operational at the end of the month.... The diagnostic guide issued by Wuhan University's South Central Hospital proposes a method for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.

. As the virus develops, there may be under-thoracic appearances, gravel road signs (small leaf spacing thickened with varying degrees of pulmonary follicle abundance) and pulmonary actual changes.
There is very little information about COVID-19 micropathological lesions and pathologies.
The main pathological findings of the autopsy were as follows:
Physical eye examination: pleura, cardiac encephalitis, pulmonary deformation and pulmonary oedema
Four severe levels of viral pneumonia were observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pulmonary cell growth, large number of atypical pulmonary cells, lymphocytes immersed with mesophageal inflammation and formation of polynucleic giant cells
. Heavy pneumonia: Comic pulmonary pulmonary damage (DAD) Accompanies comprehensible pulmonary pneumatic seepage fluid.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxiaemia.
Pneumonia during the recovery period: leopardization and interpulmonary fibrosis of the pneumatic cavity
Blood: Condensed blood in dispersive blood vessels (DIC); infant white-child red cell reactions
The preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection include: staying at home; avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas; often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends covering mouth and mouth with paper towels when coughing or sneezing; if there is no paper towel, use the inside elbow cover.
It is recommended that proper cleaning of hand hygiene be done after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends wearing a cloth mask in public to prevent, to some extent, the spread of the virus by people with no symptoms. The core of the social distance strategy is to close schools and workplaces, limit trips and cancel large public gatherings, thus reducing the access of infected people to large groups.
Also, social distance guidelines provide for a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 m) in interpersonal interactions.
There are no effective drugs to prevent COVID-19. Given that it is expected that the vaccine will not be developed until at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the outbreak are key to controlling COVID-19 transmission, which is what we know is the "lapse epidemiology curve".
At the same time, the CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds, especially when there is a visible stain after the toilet or on their hands, before meals and after snoring, coughing or sneezing.
Also, it is recommended to use alcohol-containing handwashing fluids with at least 60% alcohol content to wash hands, but only when there is no soap and running water around them. For areas where water-free handwashing fluids cannot be purchased, WHO provides two formulas for local production.
These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropanol.
the use of hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not a "hand-sterilized active substance".
- Add glycerine as a wetter.
The provision of supportive care for people, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support and other affected critical organ support.
CDC recommends that those suspected to be carrying the virus wear improvised masks.
. The use of epidural oxygenation (ECMO) to mitigate respiratory failure symptoms has been introduced, but its benefits are still to be studied.
It is recommended that personal hygiene be maintained and that healthy lifestyles and eating habits be promoted, thus increasing immunity.
The support therapy may be effective for patients with early light disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China launched an initiative calling for proper care for COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.
The United States experts in acute pathology and in lung have compiled treatment proposals from various agencies and made them available free of charge through IBCC.
As of April 2020, COVID-19 special effects therapy had not been developed.
In response to certain symptoms, some medical experts have recommended the use of peptide pain (for acetylaminophenol) instead of a first-line treatment for Bloven.
Precautionary measures must be taken to minimize the risk of viral transmission and to complete operations that may produce aerosols in a medical environment, such as plugging or hand-to-hand airing, with special attention to protection.
For medical personnel caring for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends that, in addition to standard preventive measures, exposure preventive measures and air-borne preventive measures, patients should be transferred to air-borne infectious disease isolation cells (AIIR). CTC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during an outbreak.
. Recommended equipment: PPE protective suit, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If possible, it is best to use a respirator (rather than a mask).
The N95 masks are authorized for use in industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized the use of such masks under the Emergency Usage Authority (EUA).
It is primarily used to prevent the inhalation of suspended particles (e.g. dust), but is not guaranteed for effective isolation of specific biological agents when used for other uses.
If there is no mask, the CDC suggests using a mask, which can also be self-made if necessary.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are less symptomatic and do not need to use mechanical ventilation or other options, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.
The medical staff is actively conducting research in the hope of providing breathing support to COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure symptoms. There is evidence that via nose high-flow oxygen therapy or two-phase airway positive pressure ventrals can avoid intubation.
It is not clear whether the two treatments described above will have the same effect on patients with severe illnesses.
If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use a mechanical ventilated gas because this technique also limits the proliferation of aerosol particles compared to snout high-flow oxygen therapy.
The number of beds per capita in many developed countries is insufficient, and given medical conditions, the medical system is unable to cope with the acute situation that requires admission to hospital due to the surge in COVID-19 cases.
A study in China found that 5 per cent of patients had to be sent to the intensive care unit, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical ventilation, and 1.4 per cent would die as a result.
About 30% of COVID-19 admissions in China were eventually sent to ICU.
With the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) triggered by COVID-19, the complexity of mechanical ventilation has increased further, and oxygen is becoming increasingly difficult.
At that time, respirators that support pressure control patterns and high PEEPs will be required to minimize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung damage and air chest damage caused by the respirator.
An old-fashioned respirator may not be able to achieve a high PEP.
Since January 2020, a number of antiviral drugs have been in the clinical trial stage.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
While it may not be until 2021 that a new drug will be developed, several drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing stages.
People with serious illnesses can try to use antiviral drugs.
The WHO calls on a wide range of volunteers to participate in potential therapeutic effectiveness and safety trials.The FDA has temporarily authorized the restoration of plasma transfusions as experimental treatment for people with severe life-threatening conditions.
No necessary clinical studies have been conducted to demonstrate whether the therapy is safe and effective in treating the disease.
In February 2020, China released a mobile application to contain the outbreak.
The user is required to enter the name and ID number as required.
This application can be used to detect "close contact" through monitoring data, and thus to determine the risk of potential infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
Once potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends self-segregation, but also alerts local health officials. Combined application of cell phone data big data analysis, facial recognition techniques, cell phone tracking and artificial intelligence, tracking infected people and their contacts in Korea, Taiwan, China, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized security agencies to track cell phone data of suspected coronavirus carriers.
The purpose of this measure is to impose isolation and to protect groups that may be in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, German telecommunications shared aggregated mobile phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal agency, in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
The Russian Federation deploys facial recognition technology to detect persons who violate quarantine regulations.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera noted that mobile phone operators data "40% of citizens are still moving around".
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hack marathon with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for creative solutions on a global scale to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Isolation, travel restrictions, treatment of side effects or fear of self-inflicted infection may all bother you.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor's view that "the sense of social isolation, solitude, health anxiety, stress and economic depression are perfect storms that harm people's mental health and well-being. "
The disease is milder, with little or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
The case of light disease can usually be recovered within two weeks, while the case of severe or acute illness may take between three and six weeks to recover.
According to data from other similar viruses (e.g. SARS and MERS), pregnant women develop into COVID-19 patients at higher risk, but lack COVID-19 data support. COVID-19 may have an impact on the lungs of some people, thus triggering pneumonia.
In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which in turn leads to respiratory failure, sepsis shock or multiple organ failure.
. COVID-19 Related complications include sepsis, coagulation abnormalities, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
6% COVID-19 Patients admitted to the hospital had coagulation abnormalities, especially the extended duration of the coagulation enzyme, while 4% of patients in the group had kidney dysfunction abnormalities.
- About 20-30% COVID-19 patient liver enzyme (transmitting enzyme) is elevated.
According to the same report, the average time between onset and death was ten days, of which the average time spent in hospital was five days.
However, the average time between admission and death of patients who have been transferred to ICU is seven days.
An early case study found that the average time between the onset of early symptoms and death was 14 days, with an overall time range of 6 to 41.
A study by the National Health Council of China (NHC) found that the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The autopsytopathological examination of lung samples shows that both lunges have an amphibious pulmonary lesion-accompanied cell fiber slime sample secretion.
The pulmonary cell observed viral cell disease.
The lung image is similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the deaths reported by China's National Health Council, 11.8 per cent resulted in heart damage due to higher levels of myocalcium protein or cardiac arrest.
According to data released in the United States in March, 89 per cent of admissions have a history of past illness. The availability of medical resources and regional socio-economic conditions may also affect mortality.
Given regional differences and methodological difficulties, estimates of disease mortality vary.
An underestimation of cases of light disease can lead to overestimation of mortality.
However, if the death of a case is due to a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
In comparison with non-smokers, smokers develop into COVID-19 patients at a rate of 1.4 times higher, requiring intensive care or death at a rate of about 2.4 times higher.... People are concerned about the long-term after-effects of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority of China found that lung activity decreased by 20 to 30 per cent among some of the recovered, and lung scans showed organ damage.
In addition, recovery may be subject to post-care syndrome for serious illness.
As of March 2020, it is not certain whether the pre-existing infection will provide the recovered with effective long-lasting immunization.
Immunisation can be determined based on behavioural characteristics of other coronavirus, but some COVID-19 cases have been reported to be positive for coronavirus testing shortly after recovery.
It is believed that these cases are continuing infections that worsen rather than re-infecting.
This virus is considered a natural virus, originating in animals and infected through spills.
The actual origin has not yet been determined, but as of December 2019, the extent of infection is almost entirely interpersonal.
The first batch of 41 confirmed cases published by the Lancet in January 2020 COVID-19 case studies showed that the first onset date was 1 December 2019.
The earliest onset date reported in WHO official publications is December 8, 2019.
Quantification of mortality is usually done using several methods.
These figures vary from region to region and will change over time and be influenced by demographic characteristics such as detection, quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the onset of the first outbreak and age, gender and overall health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected deaths, and U07.2 to clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed infections COVID-19 but without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 deaths. The disease rate is equal to the total number of deaths within the given time frame divided by the total number of confirmed cases.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global disease mortality rate was 6.9 per cent (153,822/2, 240, 191).
Some other measures also include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), the former reflecting the percentage of confirmed deaths from disease, and the latter reflecting the percentage of infected deaths (including confirmed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and follow the entire process of a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected persons produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies provides information on the number of infected persons.
The Italian Epidemic Center Castiglione d'Adda is a small town with a population of only 4600, with 80 people (1.7%) currently dying from the outbreak.
In Gangelt, the epidemic spreads through various carnivals, even to young people, but the mortality rate is relatively low, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.
In addition, the German medical system has become overburdened.
According to the blood donors' assessment, about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.
To date, 69 people (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate vary by sex.
Chinese and Italian studies show that men have higher mortality rates than women.
Men in the 50-60 age group are at the highest risk of death, with only a gender gap in the 90-year age group being close.
The male mortality rate in China is 2.8 per cent and the female mortality rate is 1.7 per cent.
The exact reason for this gender difference is not clear, but it may be caused by genetic and behavioural factors.
. Gender-based immunological differences, lower rates of smoking among women and lower age of men with combinations (e.g. hypertension) than among women lead to higher mortality rates among men.
In Europe, men accounted for 57 per cent of the infected, and men accounted for up to 72 per cent of the total number of deaths due to COVID-19.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not yet tracked the gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola virus, HIV, flu and SARS affect men and women differently.
The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher and the chances of exposure to the virus are higher.

The name was chosen in order to avoid citing specific geographical locations (e.g., China), animal species or populations, in line with international naming recommendations to prevent stigmatisation. The virus that triggered COVID-19 was called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, WHO uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus that triggers COVID-19".
The disease and the virus are commonly known as the coronavirus.
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were widely referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, based on the 2015 guidelines on the use of location in disease and virus names, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as temporary viruses and disease names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
In view of capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers began printing health-care materials, such as snout and respirator components.
For example, an Italian hospital desperately needs ventilator valves, suppliers are unable to deliver components within the required time frame, a local start-up company conducts reverse engineering and prints the 100 ventilators required overnight.

Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.
Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively engaged in international research, research and development of vaccines and drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity experiment" to assess the treatment effects of the four existing anti-virus compounds that are currently most likely to produce therapeutic effects.
There is currently no vaccine, but institutions at all levels are actively developing a candidate vaccine.
As SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both enter human cells via ACE2 receptors, it is necessary to use SARS-CoV for the results of previous work.
People are working on three vaccine strategies.
First, researchers plan to develop a full-virus vaccine.
The purpose of using such viruses, whether inactive or lethal, is to provoke a rapid immune response in the human body in the event of a new infection of COVID-19.
The second strategy is to develop subunit vaccines designed to develop a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to respond sensitively to certain subunits of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, such studies focused on supporting viral intrusion into the S stinging protein of the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine development technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the experimental vaccines developed by these strategies must be tested. On 16 March 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched the first clinical trial of vaccines.
The vaccine contains harmless gene sequences from the replication of viruses that cause disease.... It has been argued that antibody dependence enhancement can be a major challenge in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this argument is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials had been conducted.
Seven trials completed the assessment and were approved for treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydrochloroquine or chloroquine.
The conversion of antiviral drug use accounts for the vast majority of research in China, and nine third-term clinical trials on Redsieve will be conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and candidate drugs has been initiated. Several existing antiviral drugs for treatment COVID-19 are currently being assessed, including Redsyve, chlorptunium and hydroxyl chloride, Lopinaway/Litonave and Lopinaway/Litonave combination jammer beta.
As of March 2020, the efficacy of Redsyve has been prima facie.
The clinical symptoms of patients treated with a sympathetic drug, Redesiwe, were observed to be abating.
At this stage, in the United States, China and Italy, clinical trials are being conducted during phase III. In February 2020, China initiated studies and preliminary results on chlorptunium (which was used in the past to treat malaria).
However, there are calls for peer reviews of the study.
The South Korean and Chinese health authorities recommended the use of chlorptunium.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology, however, recommends taking 1 gram a day, while reminding that a double dose is very dangerous and may even be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but doctors have the right to decide whether or not to use the two drugs mentioned above for the treatment of patients COVID-19 The seventh edition of the Guide to China also proposes the use of jammer, Libavelin or Abidore of hydrochloric Acid for treatment of COVID-19.
c) Preliminary data indicate that high doses of libaverin are inhibitive of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Following confirmation of the low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, further in vivo studies are recommended using nitronett. Research has shown that the original stinging proteins triggered by transmembrane proteinase filamentine 2 (TMPRSS2) are necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to interact with ACE2 receptors to enter the human body.
. Ostawe has no inhibitive effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has not yet been found to have therapeutic effects on COVID-19.
The cytofactor storm can become a complication of post-treatment in patients with severe illnesses.
There is evidence that hydroxyl chloride may have an anticellular factor storm feature. After completing a small study, the National Health Council of China included the bead single in the treatment guide.
After testing positive in patients with sympathy, Italy is conducting a 2-phase non-random trial at the national level.
A combination of serum iron protein blood testing, the identification of cytokinesis storms, is designed to curb the development of the condition, which is believed to lead to the death of some infected people.
In 2017, with the support of retrospective case studies, the FDA approved the use of white cell media6 receptor stressants to treat the syndrome of steroid inoculation, or CAR T cytotherapy, caused by other causes.
So far, there is no random cross-checking evidence that the beads are anti-effectively treated CRS.
The extraction of pure enrichment antibodies from the COVID-19 rehabilitation immune system is currently being studied and injected into people in need of antibodies as passive immunotherapy before the vaccine is developed successfully.
The strategy was tried during the SARS outbreak, but the efficacy of the treatment is not yet conclusive.
the virus is an expected mechanism of action in passive antibody therapy counselling SARS-CoV-2 immunological defence.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody dependence cytotoxicity and/or osmosis can have the same effect.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of man-made monoclonal antibodies, are currently being developed.
The amount of serum produced during the rehabilitation period may increase to facilitate rapid deployment. The serum consists of the liquid portion of the blood of the recovered patient, which contains specific antibodies for this virus.
Coronavirus disease, a set of closely related syndromes.
. . . . . . . Dr. Lee Wenqian, Wuhan City Hospital, raised awareness of the spread of the new coronavirus, after which unfortunately he contracted COVID-19 and died.
