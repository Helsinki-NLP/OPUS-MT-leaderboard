The 28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead this week in the stairwell of a local mall.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who'd want to hurt him, and said, "Everything's finally getting better."
According to the San Francisco Coroner's Office, the body found at the Westfield Shopping Centre on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department stated that the death had been convicted of killing him and that an investigation was under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the American Broadcasting Corporation's station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a waterline chef in Boston, had found an ideal job as a waterline cook at Sons & Daughters restaurants in San Francisco six months earlier.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that they were "very shocked" by Frank's death.
The spokesman said, "We're a small team of close family, and we'll miss him deeply. "
In this sad moment, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially lived in a guesthouse, but recently "everything's finally getting better."
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank finds an apartment while he's dating a girl."
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his brother.
Frank has a kind heart and a wide heart.
Louis Galicia said, "Frank often cooks dinners for his family."
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He's a man of opinion.
Louis Galicia said, "All things in the world can go wrong, but Frank is called a man who shines every day. "
Anyone with a lead can call the San Francisco Police Department on call 415-575-4444.
Junior physician strike: call for new labour action
The junior physician's representative called on the coalition to approve its new labour action against the new contract dispute.
The British Medical Association Junior Medical Committee will ask all its members to support more labour action beginning in early September.
The Board of Junior Doctors stated that the ministers had not resolved their concerns about the contract.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . 58 % of the members participating in the vote opposed the contract deal.
In a letter to members on Thursday evening on Twitter, Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Junior Doctor's Committee, stated that the Government "has been silent" on the issues that led to the rejection of the contract.
She said, "In the light of this, the Executive Committee of the Board of Junior Doctors has voted against the proposed new contract in its entirety and has called for the resumption of formal consultations on all concerns. "
In response to the Government's silence, the Executive Committee of the Board of Junior Doctors has today formally asked the Council of the British Medical Association to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan aimed at upgrading labour operations beginning in early September.
The dispute has led to junior physicians participating in six strikes this year, including the first overall strike in the history of the British national health service.
Dr. Johann Malawana, leader of the junior physician of the British Medical Association, resigned after a vote boycotted the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
. At a meeting before 54,000 junior physicians voted with medical students, he said to members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract would be enforced
Russia and Turkey: "No league"?
A gesture ends a crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday, shaking hands and declaring the official end of the eight-month-long saliva battle and economic sanctions.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Yes, both sides did shake hands.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . even according to Mr. Putin's traditionally introspective criteria, Putin is just a shallow smile, and almost unsure of enthusiasm.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that his relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels, even to higher levels.
The following day, a newspaper in this room wrote that Mr. Erdoğan had acted as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something to the contrary.
The persistence of Mr. Putin's cold attitude, however, indicates that he has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was intense at the time.
. Mr. Putin made a heavy slam in response to the incident, accusing Ankara of spying on Moscow behind its back.
An attack from a so-called friend is even more unacceptable.
It's hard, if not impossible, for both sides to re-establish real trust.
Since November, there has also been a reversal of Russian public opinion.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . over the past few months has been an alarming and full-
All of a sudden, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Among them, the most serious is the accusations from senior officials: Mr. Erdoğan's family profited from the illegal oil trade in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He has categorically denied the claim.
The news from St. Petersburg, however, shows that it's time to look forward.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after all, the premise of this meeting is that Putin received an apology from Turkish President Erdoğan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are obvious.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's clear that the constant terrorist attacks have hit him very hard.
There's also an economic motive.
The Russian sanctions have hit Turkey badly, in particular by prohibiting charter services that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The figure has fallen significantly by almost 90 per cent.
As the flight resumes, the Russian travel agency and charter company will be relieved.
They'll be on the Mediterranean tour at the end of the season.
The national television station even predicted this week that once Turkish agricultural imports were liberalized, the prices of fruits and vegetables would decline.
A report from the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said, "The tourists went and the tomatoes came back."
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In addition, Ankara has long been dissatisfied with the slow progress of the EU accession negotiations and Putin's intervention, who is keen to exploit the political chill and weaken Turkey's relations with the Western world.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . following the failed coup d'état, the Russian leaders will certainly receive an additional score from Ankara.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thus, the meeting at this brilliant seaside palace in Kimbei led Russia and Turkey to form allies with two countries that had been rejected and abused by the Western world, and an analyst described it as "unbecoming union".
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . despite an open reconciliation.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has recently played the role of a yakuza in Syria, while Russia and Turkey support the opposite faction.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after nearly three hours of initial conversation, the two Presidents said at the launch that the topic had not yet been addressed.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the issue of differences between the two sides, while Putin stressed it.
There is no clear consensus between the two sides on how to work together on Syria.
It would be a good thing for the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries, Turkey, to restart the dialogue once again, given the possibility of months of open hostility and large-scale disaster brought about by the shooting down of Russian warplanes by Russian warplanes.

During that time, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the group had spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sports events, such as the rugby Six and the Wimbleton Tennis Champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to make more national brands visible.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish clients, but will not revert to the recovery.
In England and Wales, all references outside the Headquarters and Stock Exchange will be changed to National Westminster Temple Bank.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There are also other, more prominent, smaller private bank brands, such as Bank of Reward, Adam & Co, Drummond with Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McYourn has been interviewed during a tour of Invernessshire clients and employees.
He told the BBC Scottish Division that "the Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employee-employed brands, as we have become a bank with numerous brands in the wider sense of the term. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now, what I'm saying is that we're no longer focusing on the world, and we've turned our eyes to the mainland.
Each brand represents the differences in their respective industries, while our employees serve their customers through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championships; meanwhile, efforts have been made to raise the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
The CEO said, "It's time to become a multi-brand bank, because privately we've been looking for ways to become a better bank for customers. "
If three years ago we wanted to become a big bank with many brands, it would be a mockery.
So far we're focusing on customer needs, and I'm sure you've noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and now is the right time.
With Predation's success in New Marquitt's career of 3,000.

The Italian, who is now 45, is the sixth professional horse rider to achieve this milestone in the field of the flats.
The top five are: Gordon Richards, Sir, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Daituri, who had won at Ghayyar earlier, said, "It's very special."
I'm excited because my family's on the scene.
I'm happy with what I did in Newmarket, because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a large-scale horse race, nor is it the Royal Ascot, a regular Friday night with 20,000 viewers.
I'm happy, and I'm humble.

Three years ago, when he returned to the arena after the six-month ban, he was very hard-working. But, he showed amazing personality advantages and finally returned to his peak, making his first hit for those who were skeptical.
He may not be able to do it too long — Deturi said earlier that he wanted to compete at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Putin relieved Sergei Ivanov of his post as Chef de Cabinet.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov as the President's Chef de Cabinet.
For many years, Mr. Ivanov has been a member of the core group that has gained the confidence of Mr. Putin.
. Ivanov, 63 years old, has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin stated in a statement that Mr. Putin had "declared the removal of Ivanov from the post of Director of the Russian President's Office", but no reasons were given.
Mr. Ivanov ' s deputy Anton Vaino, who started in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vaino is currently 44 years old and is a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), where he worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin, "Thank you for your confidence."
I think the most important task of this government is to support the Head of State in drafting laws and controlling the implementation of directives.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had asked to resign and recommended Mr. Vaino to replace himself.
Is that a convincing smile?
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . Sergei Ivanov had long been one of Putin's closest assistants and, like Putin, worked for the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As the Chef de Cabinet, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on national television, both claimed that the Chef de Cabinet himself had asked to resign.
. . . . . . . . . . . . despite the full smile in front of the camera, almost no one believed it — especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of a failure in some kind of power struggle?
I don't know yet.
However, the official statement — that a candidate who had been considered a presidential candidate suddenly chose to take over Russia's environmental policy — raises a lot of doubts.
Mr. Ivanov ' s dialogue with Mr. Putin was quoted on the Kremlin website as saying, "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you in a dialogue to give me this hard-to-do position, which could even be said to be a troublesome one, for a four-year term. "
"The result is that I have been the President ' s Chef de Cabinet for four years and eight months. "
Mr. Ivanov took up this position in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, a former member of the National Security Agency.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin served as Director of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Service), Mr. Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At one point, the outside world thought that Mr. Ivanov might become President of Russia after the end of Mr. Putin's second term, as the three-term re-elections were unconstitutional.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The Quincy Ferry Bridge has now reached Farf.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
The engineers have connected the north side of the Queensfrey Crossing with the overhead bridge, which means that the bridge has now reached Farf.
The four-piece "bridge-side windmill" in the vicinity of the three bridgehead forts of each bridge is now nearing completion, while the project is the first one.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It used 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 sidings.
The project, which cost £1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited the scene today and became one of the first people to board the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment in the construction of the Queensland Bridge. "
We have all witnessed engineering work on such a huge project that more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel were used in this section of the bridge alone.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . despite the magnitude and the magnitude of the size and weight of the bridge . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In general, nearly 79 per cent of the general bridge is now complete, and the concrete bridge in the last section of the bridge is today being poured at Rosyth, which means that all the bridge is ready.
Michael Martin, Project Director, Quinsferi Bridge Construction Company, said, "Whatever the bridge project, the first corona is a major milestone."
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Following the installation of the last section of the road panel and its connection to the expanded North Bridge Fort Road panel, the remaining gaps on the north side or close to the land side will need to be completed next.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The moment I saw her total score, Bayers couldn't help but shed tears... and she finally ended this long journey.
Bayers was thus in the same position as Michael Phelps, a "thirty encounter of athletes" who raised their sports projects in their respective fields to a new height:
For the last three years, Bayers has been known as the Dominion, winning a total of 15 World Championship medals, including ten gold medals.

This time, however, this 22-year-old captain, known as "grandmother" by the American play, took a long lead.
She flies a kiss to the crowd at the end of her free gymnastics and announces her return, but such a return sometimes appears to be in question before.
Since earlier this week, its news has spread virally.
The six-year-old "number of shots" Mahaj Brown survived the Philadelphia shooting.
The police say that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, also the second six-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The children's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the children who were shot were Mahaj Brown.
They said Brown had multiple gunshot wounds in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but the child was sober on his way to the hospital.
"He has suffered a lot, and his little body has been shot so badly," his grandmother Delores Melendez said to the TV station.
I can't believe it.
The boy's condition at the hospital was critical and had undergone multiple operations.
His family told the television station that the child was expected to recover.
He was supposed to start his first grade at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
of the three others who were shot, two were 29 years old and one was 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims is in critical condition; the other two victims are stable.
According to TV, the child was found in the front seat of the car with that 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether there were gunmen among the injured.
The investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like multiple gunmen exchanged fire.
. A number of bullet casings of offensive weapons were found at the scene, from which it can be inferred that they used different offensive weapons.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . no doubt was a continuous battle.
There are bullet casings on the sidewalks on both sides of the street.
"So, as can be seen, there were several armed men at the scene who were in a state of intense fighting," said Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi to the television station.
There are a number of damaged houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been carried out, and the police are said to be calling surveillance footage.
On Tuesday, there was also a six-year-old (girl) who was shot in the arm while playing at the door of his home in the West Oak Lane community.
She is currently recovering, and the police are still pursuing the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie?
That's how I evaluated this year's women's Olympic gymnasium for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I've been to every Summer Olympics, but the United States has never held a hegemonic position like this.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The composition of this team is a great pride to all, as it contains the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
This team finally looks like an American team.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . over the past four years the first female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle were ranked number one, number two.
That's amazing.
At the last Olympics, Gabriele Douglas "surprisingly" became the Olympic champion, which cheered the United States.
Today, the world can witness three-time world champions, Simon Byers, Douglas and Laurie Hernández, who take conventional gymnastics into the realm.
On Thursday, Simon helped the American team achieve a four-company championship on the women's individual omnipotence project.
Her teammate, Ali Lesman, won the silver medal.
We're at the top of the sport, but not in the All-American Gymnastics classroom.
. . . . . . . . Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie enter the Olympic representative team the same way as Ali and Madison.
They're Final Five, as the next Olympic gymnasts will be composed of four gymnasts, which is Marta Karolyi's last year of teaching.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is a costly sport, that gymnasts are mainly trained at private gymnasium clubs, that their parents need to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel expenses (including those associated with coaches and gymnasium athletes and family members), and that the list of costs is increasing.
. . . . . . . . . most gymnasium clubs sit in affluent suburbs that can support the industry.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastic training to countless young girls who are heavily influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
20 years ago, I founded my own gymnasium foundation.
In my organization, we provide free, cheap gymnastics to over 15,000 urban youth (mainly blacks and Hispanic Americans) in black residential areas and raise national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this opportunity to learn and who will benefit from this remarkable Olympic movement.
c) Gymnastics helps to develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the spirit, self-regulation and determination to endure.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person's health, schooling and work success.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is significant, especially for girls.
It's an exciting moment.
I thank Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for the "girl's power" so brilliantly displayed in winning the Olympic team gold medal, and for inspiring so many young girls of diverse backgrounds to open the way to health, strength, success.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's offer, the junior physician planned to launch a further strike.
The Ministers initially hoped to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a revised contract from British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who participated in the vote opposed the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt revealed his plans to enforce the contract, saying that the British National System of Health Services (NHS) was currently in a "vacuity zone" and that a minor delay would be detrimental to the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first mentions changes to the practice of junior physicians working overnight and weekends in order to improve care during irregular working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Junior Medical Committee, said in a statement, "The junior medical doctor is still seriously concerned about the proposed contract, particularly about its exacerbation of the current labour crisis and its failure to treat all doctors fairly. "
It's only eight weeks before the first doctors sign a new contract, and we need to make progress, and time is running out.
The BMA struggles to settle disputes through negotiations, but everyone is reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government responds with silence.
Despite this, just last month we got Jeremy Hunt's word that his door was always open.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . now . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If he doesn't, the junior doctor makes it clear that they're ready to take further labour action.
The last strike took place at the end of April, resulting in the extension of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and clinicians provided cover for doctors on picket lines.
The ministers initially hoped to end the dispute caused by the change by accepting the BMA's revised contract.
BMA hopes to get better weekend wages for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
NHS Employers CEO Daniel Mortimer calls on junior doctors not to play any more strikes.
Mr. Mortimer said, " Labour action has had little effect, but on the contrary has put pressure on dedicated teams and services, leading to fear, anxiety and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families. "
Over the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Board of Junior Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other departments, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and the whistle-blowing.
The employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics — deployment, flexibility of training, other training for those who are back on duty after a career break, training costs, a common understanding of curriculum outlines, gender pay differentials in the areas of continuing leave and medical care — which illustrate the importance that employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health attach to the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
2 pounds a day to reduce the threat of a heart attack.
The officials recommended that a drug of £2 a day be extended to more patients and that it be extended, after which thousands of people with heart disease would benefit from the drug.
The anticoagulator can reduce the risk of reoccurrence of heart disease in people with heart disease.
This drug lasts for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack.
The National Health and Clinical Optimization Institute (NICE), the regulatory agency under the British National System of Health Services (NHS), recommends that patients continue to take medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, NHS regulatory agency NICE recommends that patients be given continuous medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, one quarter of whom continue to suffer from renewed heart attack or a stroke.
The heart attack and stroke are caused by fatty material deposited into the arterial wall to form a patch.
If the patch breaks, it leads to a thrombosis, which in turn prevents the blood from entering the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the thrombosis moves, it enters the bloodstream, hinders the flow of blood into the brain, causing a stroke.
A patient who has experienced a heart attack has a higher risk of having a heart attack again.

The NCIE Draft Guidance, released today, suggests that patients take 90 mg for a 12-month replacement, followed by a three-year daily 60 mg for Caguere and two Aspilins.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said, "Despite effective secondary preventive treatment, up to one quarter of patients with a history of heart attack will have a further illness or stroke, usually with serious consequences. "
The fear of a relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence suggests that taking it for Caguere with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of a relapse and stroke in those who have experienced a heart attack.
We are very pleased that the interim recommendation for Cagraé will provide thousands of beneficiaries with more treatment options.
The draft guidance does not recommend the continuation of treatment after this period, given the limited information on the efficacy and safety, especially the risk of haemorrhage, of Cagne after three years.
Computer culture makes "election fraud" prevalent in Muslim areas.
Tower Hamlets, the former mayor of Lutfur Rahman, was sacked last year for corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
The culture of "political correctness" has led to widespread electoral fraud in the Muslim community being ignored, as this lethal government report reveals today.
The former cabinet minister Eric Pickles, Sir, accused the police, the electoral regulatory body and the town hall of turning a blind eye to evidence of the misuse of the election for "too sensitive to ethnic segregation and religious issues."
The former Minister for Community Affairs, the current anti-corruption man, said that intimidation of voters with religious positions had a bad effect and that the police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside the polling station as a way to protect the timid voters.
He advised voters to carry identity papers when voting in order to confirm their identity.
At present, voters simply have to state their name and address.
The report even recommends ink that cannot be polished on the fingers of the voters to prevent people from voting twice.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He called for increased access by the media to parliamentary documentation and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local governments from a widespread culture of corruption and financial fraud closely linked to it," he said.
The report was requested to be released at Downing Street following the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that there was a chain of corruption and offences against the incumbent mayor of Rahman and that he should be dismissed from his post.
The court found that Rahman "extremely abused" the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and closed his mouth to allegations that the sword pointed to his racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
It is said that Rahman " claimed during the campaign that voting for him was a religious obligation of the faithful Muslims ... "
As many as 300 votes were in doubt, and it was possible that voters faked the votes of others.

Sir Eric (in the photo) gave a number of suggestions regarding the clean-up of the voting mechanism, which included bringing identity papers to confirm his identity.
In his report, he said: "The evidence shows that senior members, especially in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi background communities, pressured vulnerable groups in some minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote according to their wishes. "
" Because of their excessive sensitivity to racial segregation and religious 'political correctness', they fear that State institutions will turn a blind eye to such behaviour ... "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The report also calls for rigorous scrutiny of registration information to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
The recommendations included requiring voters to present identity papers before voting.

c) Systematically verify the ethnic affiliation of voters to ensure eligibility to vote.
c) Set the validity period for automatic mailing of voting requests to three years.
It is prohibited for political activists and militants to deal with completed mail ballots and mail ballot envelopes.
The police were authorized to set up a cordon around the polling station.
The amendment of the legal provisions makes it easier to charge the persons concerned with the crime of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to take photographs at polling stations.
c) Provides for the use of English only (except Wales) at polling stations.
Increased training to ensure that staff members strictly comply with the requirement that voters go to the polling hall alone.
Sir Eric denounced Metropolitan Police for "surprising" that they had not made any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets incident.

Sir Eric said, "Last year, the court's verdict on Tower Hamlets sounded a wake-up call. "
The glorious tradition of "mothers of parliament" exists in my country, yet some institutions secretly resort to election fraud and posthumous reliance on it is worrying and threatens this good reputation.

CBC Olympic spokesman apologizes for the Chinese swimmer's comments "slow as a pig."
Wednesday, Byron MacDonald angered viewers watching the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Olympic live broadcast of a comment by 14-year-old general Ayyam on the fourth place in the women's 4x200 m free swim relay.
A spokesman for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer would "swam faster than the smell spread" in the game, and that at the end "was as slow as a pig", after which the CBC was forced to apologize.
The spokesman Byron MacDonald, at the end of the women's 4x200 m free swim relay final, made some observations of his own, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
The audience heard the CBC spokesman team, Byron, who wore the Colored Glass reviewer, say, "The 14-year-old Chinese little girl made a stupid mistake. "

Emmett Macfarlane pushes: "That CBC spokesman said China's 14-year-old swimmer was ‘slow like a pig'?"?
This idiot didn't realize it was live.

When Twitter users heard that Byron MacDonald was slow in responding to this, they didn't stop it.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wow #Bylen MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your words sound like a bunch of racists to all of us. #It's annoying.
soon after, CBC broadcast host Scott Russell apologized for Byron's statement on the air, saying, "We apologize for our comments on the live swimmer's performance. "
"We're sorry for this anachronistic language. "
CBC apologizes more than 90 times to those Twitter users who responded to the statement.
Another spokesman, Scott Russell, also apologized on Byron's behalf.
CBC then pasted their apology copy to more than 90 other Twitter users protesting Byron's statement.
The channel also soon made an apology and issued a statement.
We're so sorry to say something like that and make it live.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to the viewers who watched us live and to the viewers who watched us on social media.

That is to say, the wording is really inappropriate, and Byron's very sorry about it.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast, saying that his words did not mean half a bit of physical assault and tried to justify his statements with it.
I'd like to spend some time apologizing for what I said last night after the women's relay, as he said on the CBC Odyssey.
"I'm just commenting on the performance of the swimmers, not on their individual. "
"Of course, I don't mean to be disrespectful. I'm sorry. "
Primark, customers are outraged at a woman who tries to wear panties in the middle of the store.
A woman at the center of a Primark store took off her underwear on the spot, and the customers in the store didn't know where to look.
Even worse, she tries to figure out how she looks when she wears it, then strips her panties off and put them back on the shelf.
She went on to browse the shelves and eventually tried four panties in this store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The woman kept trying on her underwear in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, and then put it back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson (mother of the two children), who was also in the store at the time, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman was "dressed again and then walked out of the store and bought nothing."
She said, "Everyone can't believe what he's seen. "
She stood in the middle of the store, took a pair of panties off the shelf, took off her tights and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a hidden place to try it on — she was just standing there, it's shameless. "
"When she took her panties off again, everyone was shocked to see.... Apparently, she was still dissatisfied because she put them back on the shelf. "
After that, she tried three more like this, and finally found out that she didn't like it, and then dressed up again and walked out of the store.
"She doesn't seem to care who's looking at her - or who's finally buying the panties she's trying to go through. "
Ms. Davidson (33 years old), who lived in Kent town, said, "It's disgusting to think that someone will buy someone else's underwear that they've worn and not been cleaned. "
This happened Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "After she leaves, the shopkeeper will obviously have to take care of these panties, fortunately so. "
"I hate buying home a new pair of panties, but I find another woman trying through and not being cleaned. "
A spokesperson for Primark said, "Primark already knows what happened in our Folkestone store on August 9 (Tuesday). "
All problematic goods have been laid down.

A hooligan family destroyed a low-rent house in Soltash, Cornwallshire before being deported.
. . . . . . . . . a hooligan family who had been evicted for intimidating their neighbours and had destroyed their low-rent homes before leaving, resulting in a loss of £50,000.
Following a long series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and his husband Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a low-rent house in Soltash, Cornwallshire.
After being forcibly removed from the residence, housing association officials were surprised to find that the site had been severely damaged.
The walls are full of holes, floors are broken, garbage is thrown all over the ground, and walls are covered in messes.
The family has been moving since the expulsion and is said to be currently living in a private home
Donna McEvoy, house manager of the Cornwallshire Housing Association, said she was concerned that the house could no longer be saved.
She said, "For the people who live here, it's a nightmare, and I don't think people can live like this. "
There are a lot of things to weigh now, because this house is likely to be a bad element in Cornwallshire.
The family is notorious, and their names are equally notorious.
The couple had three sons, who would live here from time to time. Police say that the family's terrorist acts included the use of baseball bats to fight in the streets, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, yelling, quarreling and cursing.
In June, this 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received an anti-social behavior resolution.
In this house that could be demolished, many of the rooms were left behind for a long time.
In this room where drugs were traded, the floor was lifted.
Neighbors say they often see them fighting in the streets, and they often call the police.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after giving them the 11-week extension to voluntarily move away, the Cornwallshire Housing Association forcibly removed her and her husband from the house this week.
At last, the relieved neighbors cheered for it, saying that the previous life had been hell on earth.
One of the neighbors said, "They don't care about anyone. "
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's been so bad.
We've seen cops come in the door a thousand times.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep. "
We got up early because it's too quiet here — we're not used to it!
They're finally gone. It's great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, community executive manager of the Cornwallshire Housing Association, said that the family had not been able to cooperate properly with the local government.
The family has lived in this house for 20 years, and the police are visiting us often.
Garbage and old toys were thrown on the side of the cheap rental house weed.
He added: " Unfortunately, the tenant was not responsible for her actions with her family, and the eviction was the last thought of by the Cornwallshire Housing Association. "
This is a very difficult case, because their actions are extremely extreme, and what they do must have caused the neighbors to feel a lot of fear.
I appreciate the work of my team, as well as the Devonshire and Cornwallshire police and members of the community who have braved to provide us with information.
I hope that this will bring some comfort to the neighbors and convey the message that we will not tolerate anti-social behavior.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said that their three sons had lived in the house at various times, but also said that they were in their 20s.
After they were driven away, a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms.
The workers of the Housing Association will soon clean up the piles of garbage around the house.
In 2014, police had searched the house, found more than 70 grams of marijuana, and also found scales, drugs and £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and drug trafficking intent.
She claims that the money was used to buy tombstones for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that after being homeless, Tanya and her husband are now living in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house are covered with graffiti.
The police said they would evict tenants who disobeyed the Tenant Rules.
. .Angela Crow of Devonshire and Cornwallshire Police said that the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to defy the tenant rules.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Devonshire and Cornwallshire Police Department will never tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour, and they will continue to work together to protect our community.

"Treats": Naked Calendar "Men and Women Love"
The "Treats" magazine will work with photographer David Bellemere to film a set of inspiration from the 2017 calendar of Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar, rather than the famous nude.
"Treats" president Steve Shaw said earlier this year that their nude-based magazines were different from the old-fashioned Playboys because "the latter are oriented towards men. "
And we're looking at women.
It's obvious that he thinks this is the same set of calendars.
"We need to show the eternal and classic nudity that makes both women and men feel comfortable, and this time is inspired by it," Shaw said at a calendar launch.

French courts have rejected petitions for the demolition of shops in jungle camps
A French court rejected a petition by the Galèle government intended to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle refugee camp, which currently houses thousands of refugees.
At the Court's hearing this week, the Galèle government argued that the French government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops in the camp. The population sold goods, including cigarettes to energy drinks, hairdressing services in these stores in the camp, and also sold tea for 50 cents (40 pence) in temporary restaurants or basic restaurants for several euros.
The Galle governor's office believes that these places should be demolished because of their non-tax parallel economy, as well as fire and health hazards.
The humanitarian community, on the other hand, has stated to the Court that these stores and restaurants are extremely important, as free food provided by State-supported associations and other groups simply does not meet the needs of the growing refugee population in the camp.
They claim that these temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The Rille court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the operators of the 72 temporary stores, but stated that the Governor of Calais' concerns were "fully understandable".
According to Judge Jean François Molla, the role of these grocery stores, cafés and restaurants is far more than simply to provide food to those refugees "who live in extremely dangerous conditions".
He said that these places were a calm meeting point between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the "Jungle Book Kids" café in the camp, which provided 200 foods, English and French classes per day and offered shelter advice to hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 17,000 people signed a petition to protect the café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was written that the closure of the café "will be a great disaster for these children (many of whom are only eight years old). "

It is understood that in July 2014, the National Tax Administration Department took a step forward in the central government's functional departments by issuing a "Mechanism for Information Disclosure in Major Tax Violations" in conjunction with the Tax Credit Management Scheme.
However, the facts of the violations in these cases, the legal basis, the handling of the penalties will be made public, and the basic information of the offending parties, as well as the persons responsible for the relevant intermediaries, will be disclosed on the "blacklist" as well.
Government departments such as Quality Inspection, Finance, and Customs have also taken related disciplinary measures against "blacklist" parties.

In 2015, for example, Jiangsu Province had up to 21 per cent land development, which was the highest in the country ' s province, and the Autonomous Region.
As a result, the problems of high pollution, large energy, and multi-occupancy have not yet been fundamentally addressed from the shift in productive lifestyles.
. On the one hand, from the effectiveness of the creation of various ecological environments at all levels in Jiangsu province, it is the absolute advantage of the country; on the other hand, the resource environment carries a great deal of pressure.
The solid promotion of ecological environmental protection and governance requires a fundamental advance in the transformation of productive lifestyles in order to build eco-civilization for transformational livelihoods.

On 11th, several businesses came to the City of Qingdao Clearinghouse to file a claim for a right to excretion, after which they would pay a fee for the use.
This upcoming first list of transactions also heralds the formal opening of the piloting of the Qingdao Sewery Trade, which will also be the first in the province and the first in the country's urban level.
In the morning of 11, Zhao Suping, the general manager of Qingdao's Twin Peaches Fine Chemical (Group) Ltd., came to Qingdao City's Clearing Rights Trading Centre to submit a claim for sewage rights.
The business was completely out of production at the end of last year in the old city area of Qingdao, and the environment was relocated to the new plant area of Flat.
Following the submission of the application form, such as the environmental impact report of the construction project, the Qingdao City Centre for Repository and Trading Services began the first trial of the application material.
Based on the collection criteria established by the Qingtao market price, finance, etc., the current estimate of initial excretion royalties is approximately $6412,000, and staff will complete their approval within seven working days.
This upcoming first list of transactions also heralds the formal opening of the piloting of the Qingdao Sewery Trade, which will also be the first in the province and the first in the country's urban level.
Zhao said that the business environment had now been invested in 400 million dollars, apparently huge, but that it had a significant impact on the concept of business management, social benefits and space for innovative business management.
On the same day, the Qingdao Quan Xin Zhi Zhuo passenger car accessories Ltd. also came to claim sewage rights for the production of 4,200 high iron and moving team interior fittings projects each year.
The project, which is a mechanical processing enterprise, is applied for an initial discharge of 0.514 tonnes/year for chemical oxygen (COD) and 0.052 tonnes/year for ammonia (NOX).
Atmospheric pollutant discharge rights are used and traded for the city-wide electricity, thermal production supply priority industrial enterprises.
The existing sewage units, which had received an environmental review by 1 January 2016, are not subject to a fee for use.
" Rewarded access to sewage rights does not amount to a power to illegally discharge and does not release pollutants at will ... "
The deputy director of the Qingdao City Environmental Protection Agency, Han Hong Yan, described the fact that in the case of illegal sewage, ultra-platform sewage was still subject to punishment under the relevant regulations and that it was impossible to allow illegal businesses to avoid punishment by buying the right to sewage.
In other words, environmental violations are severely combated by legal means and enterprises are severely punished for over-standard sewage, thereby protecting the environment and safeguarding public health.
Today, businesses, for their own benefit, have increased incentives to treat pollution, valued limited drainage rights and reduced pollutant emissions.
With the drive of economic interests, the reduction of emissions of pollutants is transformed from a coercive act of government to a conscious market act of business, thus truly achieving the goal of protecting the environment, preserving nature and safeguarding public health.
The right to discharge, also known as the "emission rights", is the right to release pollutants, meaning the right of the emitter to release pollutants into the environment within the limits allocated by the Government.
This right is essentially the right of the drainer to occupy, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.
The next step, if total pollutant emissions do not exceed the allowable emissions, is to transfer discharges through currency exchange between the various sources of internal pollution.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, in order to assist these six strategic bombers in carrying out aerial strikes against the targets of the "Islamic State" in Syria, a number of Russian warplanes were launched from the Syrian Hemaimim airbase.
On 22 February this year, the United States and Russia agreed on a ceasefire between the parties to the Syrian conflict, which began on 27 February.
According to the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations identified by the United Nations Security Council, such as the "Islamic State" "Support Front".
The Russian Federation will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian military personnel will be guaranteed accordingly.

The Shanghai City Zone Junction Department has recently used electronic police to fix drivers to drive and play mobile phones, and over 30 cases have been detected in a week.
With the spread of smartphones, mobile phones are becoming more and more fun, microblogging, microblogging and even playing games, and shopping for treasures is normal, and many people seem to have to stay away from the phone and not even stop while driving.
The Road Traffic Safety Act explicitly prohibits the driving of mobile phones and defines it as "impeding safe driving behaviour".
It is unfortunate that this phenomenon has not been duly punished for reasons such as the number of offenders, the difficulty of obtaining evidence, and that the legal provisions have almost become a setup.
If the transfer department is determined to "proclaim war" on the drive-by cell phone, and to regularize this measure, this violation will certainly be contained.

This year, Zhang Bingbing, 27 years old, spent 16 years in a shooting career, actually almost wiped himself out of this hard-earned silver medal.
Zhang Xiaolong, his mother, told reporters that just as they hesitated, Zhang Binbin came to several "ficters" from his village.
These "ficters" were fellow village children who were recommended for training at the same time that year, including Zhang Bing's cousin.
Just after entering the Xiamen, Zhang Bingbing once again volunteered to go back to Shang'an's school for reasons such as family difficulties.

This time, not only coach Zhang Yaji, leader and coach of the Xiamen Shooting Campaign Center and the Fujian Provincial Team came home and eventually persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Just like yesterday's game, this Xiamen girl achieved a reversal on the shooting path with persistence.
"The method of selecting the members of each coach was different, when I saw that the friendly hand was pretty, and it took a moment to look at it. "
Zhang Dong-hong also recalled that, while not the best result in the training test, the number of rings scored was stable, which was also an important reason for Zhang Binbing to attract coaches.
. . . . . . . . during the training of Zhang Bingbing, Zhang Ajay was most impressed by the input of this farmer girl.
He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen Shooting Team, the team conducted sustained stand-off gun training, requiring the team members to remain unmoved for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has been a quiet and well-behaved child, and that she has always liked drawing and homemade hand toys since she was a child.
"I'll make clothes at home, suture patches, and Bing will pick up some edges to make my own doll. "
The daughter, she said, often sews her own handy toys, and she's good at painting, from the doll's five officers to the costume, always doing the right thing.
As an athlete, Zhang Bingbing and his family stay together much longer, only on holidays to return home, and usually rely on telephone contact.
The parents said that Zhang Binbin rarely spoke of his own hard work, whether he met or called, and more about having fun with his parents.

And in the second floor of Zhang Bing's living room, there is a cabinet full of medals, medals and certificates that she has received.
Zhang Dong-hong put the medals and medals together, and the certificates were placed in the folder to preserve them, "These are the honors that have been in our hearts for more than a decade, and we all cherish them."
In recent days, the Hebei Province Mercy Fund has sent $16,000 in condolences to Kim to six families in the villages of Ishiku Prefecture, Taipei, and Guiquan.
This is another act of condolence and care inspired by the Fund to society in the search for "orthodox children and the lonely elderly in the 7.19 floods".
7.19 Heavy rainfall affected many parts of Hebei province, causing flooding in parts of the province, as well as deaths and disappearances.
The sensed mark of the good "old iron" moved the entire province and city by saving two-year-old children and his wife, who was pregnant with a six-chae, for the unfortunate sacrifice of helping the district's compulsory drainage.
On 4 August, Hebei Province Mercy Fund staff and Hebei Brands volunteers came to the home of the good "Old Iron" and paid $3,200 in love to the family of "Old Iron".

According to the East Daily in Hong Kong, on August 12, sales of diamonds from the Mainland are currently cited as having three main problems, including the netting of false diamonds to higher prices, the weight of false diamonds, and insecurity after sale.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . while Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centres, local craftsmen's diamond cutting techniques are known for their sales, and the diamonds sold have been critically identified and are well received by Ms. Mainland.

She means she hides the diamonds in her underwear, goes to the toilet for days, takes a bath, walks to sleep.
She claims that diamonds bought in Antwerp are bought for about $55,000 per carat, and diamonds of the same quality are retailed at Xiamen for about $111,000.
- She sold all the diamonds she had bought on her behalf, earning $200,000 at a time.
According to Mainland Customs, diamonds are not goods or necessities for passengers in the journey and therefore fall within the category of goods, which are subject to declaration upon entry and exit, or are included as smuggling, and are seriously liable to imprisonment.
. According to outside sources, on 10 local time, Downing Street, the British Prime Minister's Office, announced that British Prime Minister Teresa May would spend the summer in Switzerland, but did not reveal the specific place of leave.
According to the media, after the British referendum de-Occupied, the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom chose to take a holiday to Switzerland, a "neutral country" on the European continent, with some kind of policy symbolism.
The Guardian of the United Kingdom commented that the symbolism represented by Switzerland, a neutral country, played a role in the choice of the first resort by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
The British Daily Telegraph review noted that Theresa May chose to take a vacation to Switzerland, the first time since Mrs. Thatcher had a British Prime Minister to take a vacation to Switzerland.
The choice of the two female prime ministers contrasted with the preference of the two male prime ministers, Blair and Cameron, to take vacations in hotter places.
It is known that the new British Prime Minister, Teresa May, will return to London on 24 August, after which she is waiting for a series of important work and events.
The British Parliament will reconvene on 5 September, and the subject of the debate includes online requests for a second de-European referendum.
The British referendum of 23 June decided to de-link, but the new British Prime Minister did not want to start paragraph 50 of the Lisbon Treaty with regard to the de-Europeanization of the member countries by the end of the year.
The city of Huangshan has 1325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects, all of which are the first in the province, in both type and number.
Because the culture of insignia is largely dependent on oral indoctrination, many non-remnants are on the verge of loss, and the use of digitized technology for preservation and protection is imperative.
In accordance with the main points of work of this year's Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, the Standing Committee plans to hear reports on the consideration of special reports on its work and to conduct a thematic inquiry on the implementation of the Banking Supervision Act to serve local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research teams to conduct research in some municipalities in preparation for thematic inquiries.

China's Mars program is here.
Our Mars exploration mission is to be surrounded, landed, and patrolled, a form that has never been abroad.
The goal of our Mars exploration launch is to think about one step around, land, and tour, a task that is quite difficult.
Because Mars probes take 26 months to meet a time window, experts are working closely on an engineering plan to launch our first Mars probe in this window in 2020.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
" Every two or three years, there is only one opportunity for Mars to be the closest to Earth, at this point in time, to launch a Mars probe, which is the most energy-efficient for the launch vehicle. "
" Taking into account the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be carried out by our Long March 5 carrier rocket ... "
Our Mars exploration mission has to be surrounded, landed, and patrolled at a time, a form that was never seen abroad, where it was proposed to be surrounded and landed at a time, but the landing failed.
. Mars exploration involves a great number of technical areas, and in particular, although the Mars vehicle is a space detector, it has distinct features compared to the general space detector.
That is, the Mars probe needs to have the ability to determine the course and detect the danger of the barrier.
According to Pang Sho Ho, a Fellow of the five Chinese Space Technology Group, humans are so favored with Mars exploration because of the scientific, technical and other significance of the exploration of Mars and even its relevance to the future of mankind.
Today, Mars has become the most studied planet of humans other than Earth, and the history of humans using space detectors for Mars exploration has spanned almost the entire history of human space.
As a result, humans wanted to establish a settlement base on Mars one day, eventually immigrating to Mars and turning it into the second home of humanity.

So, the detection or human landing of Mars is a study that can provide a plan to prevent the Earth from turning into a second Mars that is hard for humans to survive.
As of June 2016, 114 lunar explorations and 43 Mars explorations had been conducted globally.

The major space powers of the world have developed exploration programmes targeting Mars systems, which show that Mars exploration today is hotter than the Moon.
On 5 November 2013, India launched the first Mars probe, Mangarian, to become the first country in Asia to successfully detect Mars.
The Mangarian is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars, and to find out if there are signs of methane and life on Mars.
The hardest part of this mission is that the probe has only one chance to move into the Martian atmosphere and slow down the parachute.
. According to Sun Zechu, the master designer of the Mars probe in the General Department of the China Space Technology Group Company, the Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges.
. Mars has a low atmospheric pressure, with only 1% of the Earth's surface atmospheric pressure, and high uncertainty.
. Scientists do not have a thorough understanding of such factors as its change and characteristics during the storm.
. Mars often forms dust storms similar to Earth's sandy weather during the summer, which can lead to a sharp drop in solar light energy received by Mars vehicles, and must design a "sleep" pattern for Mars vehicles, allowing them to patiently wait for the duststorm to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere also has a reduction effect on solar light, which poses a challenge to the energy supply for Mars exploration.
This requires the probe to have a larger solar wing area and to constantly adapt and work towards the direction of the Sun.
. Also, Mars surface gravity is only 38% of the Earth, but more gravity than the surface of the Moon, so the probe needs greater power.
" This Mars exploration mission is at its core, and the most difficult place, is the process of aerodynamic shape and parachute slowdown after the probe enters the Mars atmosphere, with only one opportunity, which must ensure success ... "
. . . . . . . . . . . . due to the distance of the Earth from Mars and the inability of the entire process to be controlled by the ground in real time, Sun Zechu said that it had to be done autonomously by means of detectors.
In the absence of so many propellants to offset that high speed, the slowdown depends on the role of the Martian atmosphere when landing on Mars, which, however, is difficult to simulate on the ground.

Since Mars is much further from Earth than the Moon, the detection of Mars requires a series of more complex techniques.

Original title: "Doctor of the Corridor" Lango Peak v. Host Wang Zhi An Honorary Torment at first instance
The Law and Order Evening News, in response to statements made by the host Wang Zhi-an on Shinwa Weibo about the incident of the Doctor of the Corridor, Lanchong Feng sued Wang Zhi-an and Peking Xiaomong Network Technology Ltd. to the court.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . yesterday afternoon, the Haydn Court handed down its judgment in the case, which found that Wang Zhi An and Microdam did not constitute a violation, and rejected all of Langgong Peak's claims.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in early 2014 an O.J. Wang Zhian investigation found that, although Lango Peak, which had been sitting in the hospital corridor for more than 600 days, had been shaped by the media as a sad hero under institutional pressure, there was a great deal of false information about these reports.
On March 29, 2014, the Channel Doctor program produced by the Oval News Survey aired.
The various so-called overmedicines reported to the media by Lancong Peak have no evidence to support them.

The bicycles are expected to achieve the Olympic gold medal "zero breakthrough", while the female foot girl will challenge the two-time world champions, the German team, looking forward to the bursting cold into the four.
The state of Wang Town has been prominent for nearly two seasons, winning silver medals at the Beijing Athletics World Championship last year, and further upgrading individual project champions at the Group's World Championships in May this year.
Zhang Hye-jin, a 27-year-old South Korean archery female, won the gold medal in the women's archery individual, and won the Olympic gold medal after the group race, becoming a double champion.
Zhang Hye-jin, who was considered a big, late player, regretted not receiving tickets to the last London Olympics, is proud to stand on the highest winning podium of the Rio Olympics today.
Zhang Hue-jin won the gold medal in the final of the women's archery individual race at Rio Samba Avenue Stadium, Brazil, defeating Germany's Lisa Onru 6-2 overall.

Zhang Hue-jin recalled that "there was so little level before he went to high school that he could not compete in the national competition.
Zhang Hue-jin won only fourth place in the London Olympic selection four years ago, and unfortunately lost the Olympic entry ticket, only to win two gold medals by co-workers and best friend Chevbo.
Zhang Hue-jin spoke of her own gold-raiding speech at the end of the women's archery individual ceremony, "It may be that this brought good results and satisfaction to the end of it as much as possible.
The 28-year-old South Korean archery "One Sister" and the London Olympic archery individual gold medalist Chivbo won the bronze medal.

The new generation of iPhone is a "mass-watching", hot, hot, rich and empty... If you want to buy the real thing at first, you have to choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This exacerbates people's disappointment with the new phone, "It's longer, but it can't project holograms at all! This generation of iPhone sucks. "
IPhone7 like other iPhones, was accompanied by countless secrets before birth.
In addition, there are several sources that claim that the new generation of iPhone will cancel the 3.5mm headphone interface and instead use the Bluetooth connection and charging interface, which will provide space for apples to add a second speaker.
. Another evidence to support this information is that Apple allowed headphone manufacturers to produce headphone products connected through charging interfaces as early as 2014.

On the morning of 12 August, the Press Office of the State Department held a press conference on the functioning of the national economy in July 2016.
The news spokesman for the National Statistics Office, the Director of the National Economic Integrated Statistics Division, said that in July, the rate of increase in indicators for the national economy segment slowed, but still operated in reasonable areas.
The data released by the National Statistical Office show that in July the rate of growth in fixed assets investment, total imports, etc., fell back.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in July . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He explained that "morphic fluctuations" meant that some of the economic indicators grew in July, and it was true that they fell back.
Since domestic and foreign economies were still in the process of deep adjustment in July, the international situation was complex and volatile, and the world economy had recovered less than expected, export pressures were still greater.
In the domestic context, the economy as a whole is still at a critical stage of adjustment, with the pains of adjustment being released and the economy facing considerable downward pressure, so some indicators fluctuate.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in July . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to a recent release by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people throughout the country were affected and direct economic losses exceeded $200 billion.

The weekly transit of goods in July increased by 3.6 percentage points more than last month, and the floods affected traffic in these areas in some way.
From these factors, it is also normal and expected that some of the indicators will fluctuate in July.
He said that "the momentum is still good" meant that, despite some setbacks in the rate of economic growth, the economy has generally been smooth, well advanced, and steady medium-to-good.
The CPI rose by 1.8 per cent in July and the ring ratio by 0.2 per cent; the CPI rose by 2.1 per cent in January-July, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to the Chongqing City Bureau of Meteorology portal, statistics on high temperature weather in the districts and districts, with the exception of Zhongyang, the rest of my city is entitled to various degrees of high temperature allowance.
Currently, at least 28 provinces across the country have defined the criteria for the payment of benefits, although the criteria for the distribution of benefits in the provinces and municipalities are not the same, while Chongqing receives a high temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature workday allowance.
If 35°C or less is issued at a rate of not less than ten yuan per person per day; if 37°C or more, at a rate of not less than fifteen yuan per person per day.
The maximum monthly allowance is 20 yuan/day for high-temperature staff above 40°C (except for workers who have already received a high-temperature job allowance in accordance with the law).
According to this standard, Kaizhou, which received the highest number of high-temperature weather days last month, received $330, and the lowest number of days was $80, while the highest temperature in the Zhongyang did not have a high-temperature allowance because it did not meet the high-temperature standard.
In the past, a number of units used to offset the high temperature allowance with cool drinks, and the City Security Board stated that the practice was not in line with the current scheme.
If work is stopped due to high temperature weather and working hours are reduced, the employer shall not deduct or reduce the worker's wages.
The City Social Service said that if an employee encounters a high-temperature operation and is forfeited to a high-temperature allowance, a legal interest may be claimed through the labour dispute mediation agency in which the enterprise is located, or a 12333 complaint may be called.
If a useful person refuses to pay a high temperature allowance, the worker can complain to the authority responsible for human resources social security at the county level or above where the worker is employed.

In January 2015, in a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province, central Costa Rica, a blood-bound giant mouth bird, Grecia, was discovered.
The beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people at the time, and it was completely uneatable and life-threatening.
The tragedy of Grecia, which has been reported by the media, has caused such booming calls against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica.
. People have called for stricter animal protection laws to increase the punishment of abusers.
People come spontaneously and do their best to help Grecia return to life before being injured as much as possible.
even Chuck Hull, inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of the beak in Grecia.
"Grecia's special situation, with less than 1 cm of the rest of its upper beak, has caused many difficulties in installing the new beak. "
"We scan for Grecia first and then design to make an extended prosthesis that is slightly longer than the rest of its beaks and fix it with glue."
. . . . . . . . . . . . this would reduce further intrusive harm to Gracie. . . . . . . . . . . . . Lange said to Xinhua International Reporters.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . before installing the prosthesis, the staff was to clean up the beak for Gracie every day in order to prevent infection.
. . . . . . . . a thousand miles away, the story of the giant-mouthed Grecia moved the famous documentary director, Paula Eredia, and Discovery News Channel producer John Hoffman.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in the installation of the new beaks in Grecia, they recorded a documentary film, The State of the Big Mouth Bird, which was played on the Animal Planet Channel this month.

The Core Tip: Japan Oil Enterprises are particularly wary of the rise of small independent refineries in China known as the Teapot.
The reference network reported on August 12 that Japan's largest oil company, JX Energy, believed that "the expansion of Chinese exports is one of the reasons for the downturn.
The Japanese oil company is particularly wary of the rise of a small independent Chinese refinery known as the Teapot.
The quality of China's petroleum products is getting closer to Japan's oil products as a result of the Chinese government's strengthened environmental regulations.
Before obtaining an import permit for crude oil, the Teapot Refinery generally imported heavy oil with higher sulphur content from places such as Russia for refining.
The high level of sulphur in the petroleum products produced and the poor quality of the oil are among the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining a permit to import crude oil, the Teapot Refinery was able to import Omani crude oil with lower sulphur content and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its petroleum products increased.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As a result, the quality of China's petroleum products exported from China has gradually reached the same level as Japan (the highest quality in the world)."
According to JX Energy, "After the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia", competing with Japanese products in Asian markets.
. Despite the crisis facing Japan's high-value oil, the Japanese oil company's response strategy was only "to export to profitable areas while focusing on market conditions."
The attention paid to teapot refineries is also growing, as the impact of Chinese-exported petroleum products on Asian market conditions is enormous.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
While the first four times were not targeted at the coal industry, the targeted industry became directly related to the coal industry.
Last November to January, the price of Qin Emperor's 5,500 large-caliber powered coal hovered at a low of 370 yuan/tonne for a long time, and 90 per cent of coal businesses were in deficit.
The price of coal has gradually risen since February, and recently the price of powered coal on the island of Qin has risen by four weeks in a row, rising to a high point of 16 months, at one point to $436 per ton, an increase of nearly $70 from the beginning of the year.
As prices rebounded, there was concern that a group of small coal mines would return to work.

The three surface factors also reflect the relatively slow shift in our growth patterns in the past, which has not yet been fundamentally transformed by government-led growth patterns.
Second, it is also directly related to the drive of local governments, where funds and accompanying measures are available in the process of de-production, and from this perspective it is true that differences between different regions are larger.
The third is that if some provinces, which are currently slower, are to catch up in the second half of the year, they may be at greater risk.
In this case, relying on central awards to supplement funding to advance the de-production process may have a somewhat negative impact.
First of all, de-production is not simply a total control.
Our aim is to advance the optimization of the structure by phasing out backward production and reshaping the new business landscape of the coal industry as a whole.
In the process of deploying out-of-production capacity, local governments must combine de-capacity and the transformational upgrading of the coal industry and vigorously develop related services.
Secondly, in order to complete this year's de-productivity, we also need to make full use of the power of executive oversight and administrative supervision.
Finally, we need to strengthen the bottom-up role of social security.
Because the market is directly concerned with employment, we need to enhance job skills training for both employees and workers.
"The reason for the decline in ranking is the expected deterioration of foreign investment in Brazil ' s GDP development in the medium term. "
In 2015, Brazil ' s participation in global direct investment was 3.7 per cent, down from 5.7 per cent in 2014.
The Swiss Bank's International Investment Attraction Index includes four sub-indicators: infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and volume of direct investment.
In 2015, Brazil ' s international direct investment stood at $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, "greenfield investments" in Brazil (investment models to invest in plant-building abroad) were $17.9 billion, a 2.1 per cent decrease over the same period.
) "There are 288 ‘greenfield investment' projects in Brazil, compared to an annual average of 314 between 2003 and 2014".
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10 per cent compared with the same period last year.
Original title: Canadian police kill IS supporters: preparations for home-made bomb attacks are nearing end
According to the taxi company, the taxi was transferred to Draever's house before the police arrived.
The Canadian police said in a press conference on Wednesday that the information received by the police included a "satisfaction video" provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States about the young man's impending attack.

The upgraded Kyo Hang Canal branch channel, the Old Wanfeng River, and the North Great Sliding Road, received tolls from September 1.
The two tributary channels were built with social financing, and fees were approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The Old Wanfu River channel flows through the Golden Country, the Fish Platform, and via Lake Namyang into the main channel of the Kyoto Hang Canal, which is 32.5 kilometres long.
According to the need for navigation, the Old Wanfeng River channel has taken a conservation and retrofitting approach, dredging local water depths, tailoring local rushes, etc., and improving navigation conditions.
The channel flows through the County of Kim, as a city area, and enters the main channel of the Kyoto Hang Canal via Lake Namyang, 19 km long.
Work on the retrofitting of the two lanes began in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015, with investments in the construction and operation of the Ambin Canal Logistics Service Centre in the city of Jinning.
In accordance with the principle of "credit construction, toll repayment", the Xianning City Anpine Canal Logistics Service Centre collects a toll on the route based on the rate of the reimbursement by the Shandong Provincial Price Authority.
of which, basic tolls are collected at 1.75 yuan/load tons and mileage tolls are collected at 0.05 yuan/km load tons.

The four lanes are tributaries of the Kyoto Hang Canal, all upgraded by means of social financing.
The upgrade of the Su Shu Water River route was the first to adopt the "Government + Market" model for a project to build the infrastructure of the Inland River Harbour in Shandong Province, where the Government made up the main investment and the social funds to replenish the funding gap.

The fact that 50 metres of free swimming was not Ningsai Tao's main goal, his performance and best results at the Kazan World Championships, and his limited chances of a breakthrough in the project.
It is true that Hong Kong's authoritative media, the Great Gazette, revealed that the greatest cause of Ning Zaitao's loss was that he had lost his interest in swimming.

- But after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympic Ten-metre stand, Ta Liang's competitive position declined and was blown out and fired by the Jumpers.
And he and his daughter went to ensembles like "Where's Daddy?", and he made his eyeballs.
The once Gymnastic Gold Generation Yang Wei, Lee Xiao Peng, and Chen Yi Cing are high-profile participants in various ensembles.
It is worth noting that Yang Wei Li Xiao Peng led China to the 2008 Olympic League Championship, and Yang Wei received his personal full-power gold medal twice, known as the Almighty King.

On the surface, the social networking platform has expanded the circle of interactions and reduced people's sense of isolation.
the wider reach of social networking, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone contacts, but even infiltration into the real life circles below the line, quietly changing the social life of the current population.
The benefits of online socialization are obvious, such as ease and speed, so they are particularly vulnerable to the favour of young communities.
A survey of university students' social habits shows that 57 per cent of university students use mobile phones for more than five hours a day, and that daily life is essentially "motivated".
"The social networks are low-cost, fast-transmission, multiplayer communication, etc., and are in line with the needs of contemporary college students. "

The love of friends is also common online communication, "For some time before we had no contact with friends because of some misunderstandings, and later we talked a few words in a large group before we got hot."
The IT engineer Wu is a deep web social enthusiast, most of his social life occurs online, and network contacts are many times more numerous than the number of people in the underline friends circle.

"You're hiding under ID and I came to avoid face-to-face human collisions, not only with room for spin-backs, but even giving each other more time and space to think and act. "

I met Peng and Wu in a large group because they were both active speakers and soon became familiar.
If Peng thinks Wu and the network are like two people, with dull words, and he doesn't take the initiative to make a statement, then turning around means a few words, "Oh, good, yeah," or "I'm going to go online and check it out."

The Northeast Tiger, currently listed as an endangered (EN) species by the Red List of Endangered Species of the World Conservation Union (IUCN).
According to the Forest Department of Jilin Province, data from joint monitoring by countries such as Central America and Russia in 1998 show that there are only 4 to 6 wild northeast tigers in Jilin Province and 3 to 5 northeast leopards.
According to the Chief of the Conservation Service of the Forest Department of Jilin Province in Changchun, in recent years the protection of wildlife has been increasing in Jilin Province, and the Northeast Tiger, Northeast Panther, is growing significantly in China, with a growing distribution of areas.
The latest monitoring data for 2015 show that 27 wild north-east tigers were monitored within the province of Gillin alone, and 42 north-east leopards.
The cooperation between China and Russia, as the world's flagship species for wildlife conservation in the region bordering Central Russia, is important for the recovery and reproduction of wild north-east tigers, leopard populations.
According to the Forest Department of Jilin Province, previously the Jilin Province had established a long-term stable cooperative exchange mechanism with Russia.
At the International Forum for the Protection of the Chinese Zhongchun Tigers, which ended on 11 November, there was a renewed consensus between the forestry sector and animal conservation organizations in China and Russia.

After this case, after several media reports, it became a focus case, with a very bad social impact.
Following the case, the leadership of the Criminal Police Division of the Haikou City Public Security Department attached great importance to the immediate organization of a large team of competent police officers to take the initiative to launch the investigation.
The police immediately pursued the suspect on the Internet, took a variety of measures to control him and coordinated the whereabouts of Wang through contact with the police in the field.
Since the suspect is a burglar, repeatedly dealt with by the public security authorities, with a stronger counter-reconnaissance capability, coupled with his long-term drug addiction, he is frequently interrogated about drug addiction, and interrogation is very difficult.
The Greenland shark, also known as the small-headed sleeping shark, is widely found in the North Atlantic Ocean around Greenland and Iceland, where it reaches four to five metres in length as an adult.

The traditional method of measuring years usually uses calcified tissues of animals, and fin ridges can be used in some sharks, but this calcified tissue is scarce in Greenland sharks.
The new study, led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, turned to the use of the eye crystals of Greenland sharks for the year of radiocarbon measurement.
This method was previously used to determine the age of whales, but it was used to determine the age of fish such as sharks for the first time.
Their analysis shows that the largest shark's life expectancy is estimated at 392, with an error of 120 years.
This means that the shark is at least 272 years old and is most likely to reach the age of 512.
In addition, the female Greenland shark is said to have to be about 4 metres long to be sexually mature, converted to age, i.e. at least 156 years of age before reaching adulthood.
As a result, researchers wrote in their papers that the Greenland shark was a known, longest-lived vertebrate on Earth, surpassing the former long-lived champion, Lumpback Whale (age 211).
In the past year, the gains in remittances have been significant and the exchange rate of the yuan has remained largely stable, while also laying the foundation for the promotion of the internationalization of the yuan.
In terms of market performance, over the past year, the exchange rate of the yuan has been marked by two-way fluctuations, with increased exchange rate elasticity and the expectation that the exchange rate will remain stable overall.
As of today, fluctuations in the RMB over 100 points of the dollar's median price have been repeated, but the process has risen and declined.
The last remittance measure before last year's "8/11" remittance was implemented in 2005, with a significant appreciation of the yuan against the United States dollar over a decade.
Since the implementation of the new remittance, the yuan has changed its previous appreciation, and the median exchange rate of the yuan has depreciated by about 8 per cent over the year.
On 1 October this year, the International Monetary Fund will officially admit the RMB as a weighting currency for SDR (special drawing rights).
This week, statistics published by China's Customs Administration show that China's exports and imports totalled RMB 13.21 trillion in the first seven months of the year, a decrease of 3 per cent over the same period last year.
In the same month of July, the total value of China's exports and imports declined by only 0.9 per cent over the same period, especially exports, which increased by 2.9 per cent over the same period.
The experts considered that although there were signs of stability in imports and exports in July, they should not have been over-expected.
In July, China's total value of imports and exports amounted to RMB 2.09 trillion, a decline of 0.9 per cent over the same period.
Among them, exports amounted to RMB 12.2 trillion, an increase of 2.9 per cent; imports to RMB 87.3 billion, a decline of 5.7 per cent; and trade surpluses of RMB 34.28 billion, an increase of 34 per cent.
While the total value of exports and imports continued to decline over the same period, export data increased, and since March this year exports have grown for the fifth consecutive month.
Shanghai police have captured more than 3,400 thieves in four months and attacked 157 of the plagiarist gangs.
In parallel with the investigation of the case, the police also recovered the stolen money for a total sum of over 33 million yuan.
According to the members of the theft gang, they entered Shanghai from the field in a black car package, then got off to commit the crime separately, then joined the car a few hours later and left together.
In the course of the crime, suspects are often organized in a building, using the outside wall to climb and break the window fence from top to bottom "sweeping" theft.
The suspect was previously transferred by Xu Seok Public Security Division to Xu Seok District Public Prosecutor's Office to review the charges.
The police reminded the general public that it was important to lock the doors and windows of the home when going out and advised the public to choose the tougher steel for the protection window.
In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will travel to Kenya to attend the sixth African Development Conference, according to the Chinese Voice News Evening Summit.
The African Development Conference was led by Japan, and the five previous meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, so this meeting will also be the first time that Africa has migrated.
In this regard, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan stated that local meetings in Africa had helped to draw the attention of African and European countries to Japan.
Quite in line with Shinzo Abe's visit, according to the Common Society, the Japan People's Liberation Party will send a delegation of parliamentarians to the countries concerned.
It is no coincidence that Japan's path of entry began in the early 1990s, and that the African Development Conference, launched by Japan, also started in 1993.
With 53 seats in the United Nations, Africa is an important ticket warehouse for the United Nations, and how can Japan leave Africa behind if it wants to be "normal"?
There will also be an exchange of views with national stakeholders on the extremist organization "Islamic State" and the response to terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea-Bissau.
The Japanese Foreign Minister, Wen-hsiung Kashichi, has also recently explained his intentions in the United Nations Security Council regarding this African Development Conference.
On this occasion, Abe announced that, in the interest of the stability of sub-Saharan African countries, assistance would be provided over a period of five years in the amount of 100 billion yen (about 6.1 billion yuan).

Japan's expert on Japan, Yang Burjiang, analyses that "politically, Africa, while lagging behind in relative development, has a larger number of countries, so Japan has always regarded it as a so-called ‘big boxfield'. "
Japan will not give up in the future, nor will its work on Africa be terminated, and it will continue to intensify.
Economically, because of Japan's strong productive capacity, the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the context of the ageing of small children, where domestic demand is relatively low.

A Japanese expert on Japan, Yang Burjiang, believes that Japan's intentions are clear, but that the road to Japan is bound to be difficult.
The first thing Japan has to do to achieve its goals is to get a good relationship with the neighbouring countries, in which Japan needs to have a right attitude, whether in terms of geopolitical rivalries or ethnic disputes and historical perceptions.

The Fiji team won the gold medal with impeccable performances in controlling the ball, robbing, avoiding, cooperating, running and power, the country's first ever Olympic medal.
The silver medal was also a great comfort to the defeated British team, which was the third silver medal won by the British delegation that day. This was enough to make the British rugby team proud: they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa all the way to the first seven-man rugby game into the Olympics.

Tomorrow, at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the British team, but it may not be. This Englishman is Ben Ryan, the head coach of the Fiji team from Wimbleton, who was the head coach of the British team.
It's not easy for the British team to get what they're doing today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's teaching, they did not taste the victory at the Adelaide International Seven-Man Rugby.
And now, they're only one step away from the championship.
Although they have been hit hard, they have also made very impressive progress.

Helen Grave and Heather Stanning were inspired by the cancer-stricken coach who won the boat gold medal.
Not to exaggerate, it's the most moving gold medal.
From the start of the first paddle to the present, Helen Graff and Heather Stanning have received 220 punitive pull trainings, while the gold medal they won at Estacio da Lagoa has a more extraordinary significance.

They've kept a record of 39 undefeated, with absolute advantages.
What we're seeing is these two talented athletes marching with grace on the surface of the water, but that's not all of this victory.
There are many volunteers behind each boat's gold medal, and it is their constant dedication that makes the difference, and nothing is more helpful than a coach who learned 30 months ago that he is suffering from cancer and does not know if he can live to see this day.
As he said, death can come at any time.
I had bladder cancer, and they had surgery for me.
If you don't have surgery, the cancer cells will spread all over the body.
That way, it'll be a lot worse.
It'll change your mind a little.

Quite fortunately, he started treatment in early 2014, minimizing the impact, although it might not be appropriate to say so in this case.
I need to get my paycheck, so I have to get better.
It's an incentive for me.
I live in the hospital, and although they say it's enough to walk a few steps, I walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet each time around the ward.
That's the starting point of everything.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the moment of the gold, they first thought of Williams, who was a little bit more talkative this morning than usual, in order to overcome his anxiety.
She said, "I'm in a bad mood this week and may be a little extreme, but this gold medal really means a lot. "
It repeatedly tells me how important this is to me, how hard I, Helen and Robin have worked.
This is Helen, Robin and I worked hard for three years in return.
If Robin isn't there, we're just nobody, thank him very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't find a better trainer and coach than he does.
. . . . . . Helen Grave and Heather Stanning had not tasted defeat in five years.
The penalty set for the combination is beyond their opponent's ability to compare.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . even when the final 500 metres, the New Zealand team and the Danish team began to approach, Stanning and Graff still had large physical reserves.
It was amazing.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's very important not to be influenced by the opponent.
We had a good start, and we didn't expect to do anything amazing.
We didn't think about today's glory, we just wanted to row every oar and win this game, and we did it.
It took a year for the combination to decide its own future.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . next month
But now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say it's my last game.
It'll put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It's a whole new experience, and I'm very nervous.
It's been about four minutes.
She said, "I feel much better."

Snapchat's Comic effect is sarcastic to Asians.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The 150 million daily users of Snapchat can change reality through their filtering tools and make people look funny.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
These lenses have the effect of blunting, curved features, producing more than 30 million modified self-portraits per day.
Any error will be immediately brought to the attention of the public.
The Snapchat lens had been criticized, and the application had been directed to play black or be beautiful with white skin.
Therefore, when the application provided some users this week with a filter that could create oblique eyes, quirky teeth and pink-face effects, some commentators called it a racial satire of Asian "yellows".
They even think that these recurring problems mean that the company has a larger problem with diversity.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . following Snapchat's statement that it deleted the function. . . . . . Wednesday's report on The Verge and Motherboard sparked public outrage.
The company explained that the filter was a tribute to the anime character, not a satirical Asian.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Other people are also strongly opposed to these anime images.
In an email, a Korean-American artist who tweeted and was widely shared in response to these photographs said that the filters were "at least unpleasant and uncomfortable."
She also said, "It's hard to distinguish between extremely disgusting Asian satirical images and the effects of filters."
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Snapchat is not the only company that touches the bottom lines of these cultures.
From the company board to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusiveness.
The large young group of Snapchat may be very sensitive due to the greater emphasis on racial pluralism than the older generation.
When a filter in Snapchat produced an image of insulting the user, 25-year-old Jucetti (voice translation) said in a Thursday interview: "It's harder to escape people's eyes than before. "
On Thursday, Ms. Chu, who was product manager and engineer at Mediam, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article written for Mediam and in a telephone interview, she stated that she believed that the race controversy reflected Snapchat's lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's employees, mostly white, and the leadership, all male, and added a label at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms. Chu said, " Either their employees do not have any colored people, so they can make such a decision, or there are some colored people among their employees, but their positions do not allow them to speak out. "
Other observers shared complaints that she had not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company did not publish data on the diversity of its employees and stated that it was a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his staff, but a spokesperson said that the company had recently hired a recruit to focus on the lower proportion of the population and to promote internal inclusiveness.
Ms. Zhu said that she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users who object to this act as we do."
According to the congressional team, military officials distorted ISIS intelligence.
In a report released on Thursday by a congressional team, officials of the United States Central Command changed the intelligence report to describe the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than the actual situation.
This midterm report comes from a dedicated working group formed by the Republican Chairman of the House Military Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the House Appropriations Committee.... Reports indicate that there are "widespread grievances" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who indicate that their superiors are tampering with their assessment of the war between the United States and the Islamic State.
The Central Command (Centcom), located in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news report, "the information reviewed by the senior leadership of the Central Command is more optimistic about the description of United States counter-terrorism operations than is actually the case and has always been more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies. "
The representative of the California Republican Party said, "[t]he conduct of the Central Command is unacceptable... on one hand is that our fighters have suffered from war, and on the other hand that high-level policymakers have received the wrong analysis. "
The question of the leadership of the Central Command has been extended to the highest level of the institution.
The report points out in detail the long-standing problems of the Central Command in describing and analysing the training of the Iraqi army in the United States in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that high-ranking officials of the Obama administration ordered the reports to be changed, according to the description of the report, these analysts felt that they were under pressure from the leaders of the Central Command to make a more optimistic opinion on the threat posed by the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
The report states, "In the first half of 2015, many central command press releases, statements and Congressional testimony were much more optimistic than the actual situation. "
. . . . . . . . an official of the Central Command has publicly stated that a large military operation may have taken place at the earliest in April or May 2015 to regain Mosul.
The second largest city in Iraq, Mosul, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
In a statement, Kansas Republican representative Mike Pompeo said, "After months of investigation, this result has become obvious. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . most senior intelligence officials in the U.S. Central Command have manipulated the command's intelligence products from mid-2014 to mid-2015, concealing the threat from the Islamic State of Iraq.
The Republicans set up a dedicated working group after they learned from analysts that intelligence about the Islamic State was manipulated.
As the investigation continues, more will be found after this report, which was released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
The Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their findings on Thursday, in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
In a statement, the Democratic leader of the Commission, Sheanda, said that between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command had developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of the Islamic State and the Iraqi peacekeeping forces. "
Mr. Sheanda said that the process "constructed the release of intelligence", reduced the morale of analysts and "unable to accept different opinions."
But Mr. Sheanda and the Democrats also stated that they had not found any evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on Central Command analysts, so that their conclusions were consistent with "pre-set or political narratives."
The Daily Beast reported on the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon Attorney General had begun an investigation after receiving complaints from Central Command analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman, Major Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Attorney General's investigation had not been completed and that the Ministry of Defence had not made any comments on the Congressional report.
But he said, "The experts sometimes disagree about the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence encourage a healthy dialogue on these important national security topics. "
The impact of this investigation has exceeded whether the United States-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria (an increasing number of Department of Defense officials claim) were successful.
Last year, however, these claims led the public to question the extent to which President Obama could trust the assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas issued by the Central Command.
The criticism of Islamic intelligence was reminiscent of the controversy more than a decade ago, when Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article in which it was noted that George Bush's government insisted on sending small troops to Iraq, despite the opposition of numerous analysts, and gave little consideration to the post-invasion situation.
Mr. Hook played a key role in this opposition event on intelligence in the Islamic State.
Last year, officials stated that Mr. Hook's team had come to the conclusion that the air strikes against the Islamic State refinery had not significantly cut the economic revenues of the terrorist organization, which had built the temporary refinery and continued to sell oil on the black market, which was very different from the statement published.
According to the September report of Time Weekly, the Central Command did not make this discovery public.

She said, "I don't know anything about it. "
I'm not the kind of person who remembers how many goals I've scored.
What she knows is that the U.S. team won four runs at the Olympics and competed with the team for team number one with the British team that did not fail after winning the Japanese team 2–0 on Thursday.

In Saturday's game, the American team made a miracle with amazing performance. You know, at the London Olympics four years ago, the American team was bottoming out of 12 teams.
Bam was in that team at the time.

In 2012, neither she nor her teammates were seen well.
The following year, Craig Panham, an Englishman, coached and everything started to change.
Barm said, "It's a cultural, mental and material change. "
We weren't at the current level in London.
We've come to a complete flip.
On Thursday night, Bam pulled his head off in the first half of the game with a close-range backhand shot.

This time, she's playing super often.
So is Bam.
And Panham said, "We're in good shape right now." But how good is depends on the results of the Saturday game.
It's the sour food of the Great Depression in The Great Foods.
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected President, sat in the President's office for lunch.
. . . . . . . . . . as a gourmet, President Roosevelt likes good foods on Fifth Avenue, such as foie liver sauce and Maryland stew fish.
On that day, his menu was very simple: ketchup devil eggs, mashed potatoes and fruit pudding as snacks.
And Jane Zigman said, "It's about living with people who are suffering on food. "
Her husband Andrew Ko added, "It also reflects the way Americans eat. "
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Mr. Ko's last book, Fried Cabbage, is about Chinese food in the United States, while Ms. Zigman tells the lives of slum tenants through food in her book Orchard 97.
The new book they co-authored, "The Great Food", will be published on Tuesday by Harper Press, which presents the food history of the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some common ideas about food, they met a journalist at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a simple lunch counter located in the ironing area that has been in operation since the economic collapse of 1929.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the
Ms. Zigman said, "The bread was very popular at the time. "
There was peanut bread, liver bread, soybean bread.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Imagine, your dinner is peanuts.
Mr. Ko's acting weird.
He said, "They must be like lead in your stomach."
In the years before the Great Depression, American Donton was a cafeteria, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cook for male farm workers, breakfasts, lunches and dinners with freshly tested pies.
In World War I, it was the Americans who gave food to hungry Europeans. "The Great Food" documented how this country suddenly ceased to be a rich place.
Mr. Ko explained why he and his wife were going to write the book: "At that time, food had become the main topic of discomfort for Americans. "
The other unpleasant topic was the new food of sourness: "The food of fascination" such as bread and stew became the main dish, and the stew was "the best way to cook leftovers", which Ms. Zigman said was because the cooks could use butter in the sauce to cover up hard foods.
The fresh fruit is replaced by the cheap dried fruit.
The meat that has been the main character on the American table for many years has become a rare luxury.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the course of studying a book, including various recipes, Ms. Zigman made a roasted onion filled with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said, "It's not common on dinner tables. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The peanut oil and the grilled onions are simply not matched.
This is a feature of many family economic meals.
The family economists influenced the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as chef of the Federal Department of Family Economics from 1923 to 1943, which was unprecedented in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines that encourage women to "find" and dare to turn bad foods such as cream pasta with carrots into food.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . particularly interesting is the government's response to the hungry people, such as the President's citizen Herbert Hoover's attitude that "I can't deal with someone else's business."
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

He wears a tuxedo and eats in a gold-plated restaurant.
He's obviously out of the people.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on his diet.
As this book says, the housekeepers employed by Ms. Roosevelt are not interested in the taste, so the White House "food is not only the worst food in Washington, but also the worst food to cook."
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . as soon as the United States returned to regularity, many of the ways of cooking during the Great Depression were abandoned.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they had a better understanding of Ms. Zigman's mother's eating habits, such as how she didn't throw away food.
Mr. Ko said, "She's very afraid of wasting food. "
Ms. Zigman recalled, "She actually left many lives ill. "
For example, there's been a "cream puff" incident.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after removing the dishes, she and Mr. Ko took out a sweet which they had prepared at home: this is the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt had at lunch.
Ms. Zigman said, "It's called butter and fruit," and added that the name of a new wave for a common dish is "the usual trick."
The sweets don't have raw cream, only fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We're all trying to make it hard for us to get into the sticky brown paste.
Surprisedly, this sweet tastes good.
Mr. Ko ate the second spoon, the third.
He thinks it's an acceptable confectionery dessert, and tells his wife, "It'll be better to eat with a little shredd of walnuts."
It is unfortunate that the latest monthly OPEC report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, with Saudi production at a new high.
The report does not ban the market to cast doubt on the credibility of the OPEC, and the road to the recovery of oil prices is probably still full of thorns.
This Monday, OPEC Chairman-in-Office and Minister of Energy of Qatar Sada stated that the OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on 26-28 September.
The monthly report published on Wednesday by the OPEC shows that the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, increased its production by 46,000 barrels per day in July, to 3,311,000 barrels per day.
OPEC also stated in the monthly newspaper that the low price of crude oil had led global refiners to produce more refined oil, thus increasing the excess supply in the market.
Influenced by this news, together with expectations of higher crude oil production in the United States and an unexpected increase in crude oil stocks, international oil prices fell for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday closing, the prices of light crude oil futures delivered by the New York Commodity Exchange in September fell by 2.48 per cent and those of London Brent crude oil futures delivered in October by 2.07 per cent.
According to Reuters, the proposed oil-producing country conference is unlikely to make supplies significantly tighter, and the data published by the United States Energy Information Agency has strained the market.
The Iranian official news agency Fars quoted Iranian oil minister Zangane on Wednesday as saying that Iranian daily crude oil production peaked at 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
As soon as the news of the meeting came out, Russian energy minister Novak said that there was no need for a new round of frozen negotiations under current oil prices.
The last meeting of oil-producing countries had been held in April, and OPEC member States had been unable to agree on any measures.
The BMIResearch oil and gas analyst, Emma Richards, said that the market and media might be overreacting to the forthcoming meeting of the OPEC.
. Helima Croft, head of the major commodity strategy of the Royal Bank of Canada, said that the OPEC would change the mood in the market by releasing signals that they would contribute to the agreement.
It's like a smoke and a mirror that distracts people from their sights (intentionally giving the wrong impression).
. According to Eugene Weinberg, head of bulk commodity research at the German commercial bank, it is thought that the possibility of the OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September conference is low.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all, the organization has played "The Wolf Comes".
All places need to focus on spot checks on health-care outlets that have been repeatedly punished, by advertising violations, focusing on complaints and complaints.
The National Board of Health Physiology, the National Central Medicine Administration, will organize, in due course, a monitoring of the performance of special supervision inspections in some provinces.
According to media reports, the current product homogenization problem is a serious one due to the massive influx of capital into Internet medicine, and the investment boom is fading and capital is entering the lookout period.
There are also data from the Center for Management Studies at the Allenpei Hospital in Hong Kong that a large number of Internet medical companies have died in one year of business and that about 20 per cent of the start-up Internet medical businesses no longer exist.
However, just as most Internet medical businesses struggled on the financing path of rounds A or B, several subdivisions of leading firms still had access to capital booms.
It seems that the Internet medical start-up cannot be "one nest of bees" but depends on the quasi-market demand, sunk to focus, and deep.
The fish leaped to contribute $1.20.00 million, 40 per cent of the registered capital, and Kyushu Instruments toll $1.80.0 million, 60 per cent of the registered capital.
In recent years, with national policy support in the area of medical informatics, electronic, integrated supply chain management systems have gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
The collaboration between the fish leap and Kyushu is precisely aimed at market demand, helping hospitals build up advanced supply chain management systems, and using this as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.
. . . . . . . unlike the greed of many Internet medical companies, iBaby has focused from the beginning on the vertical field of Internet obstetrics, deep-downing pregnant mothers and doctors at both ends.
The pregnant mother can not only be consulted free of charge for 24 hours and one-on-one competent doctor, but also pay for targeted medical consultations.
At the doctor's level, iBaby broke geographical limits by organizing micro-conferences such as online lectures, peer exchanges, case discussions, etc. by experts to grass-roots physicians.

It's easy to hurt the heart to stay up all night watching the Olympics.
The Brazilian Olympic Games are on fire, and many citizens will stay up and watch even when the events are broadcast in the country in the middle of the night.
In response, doctors particularly caution that there is a health hazard in spending the night watching the event, which could trigger cardiovascular disease.
If it stays up long, the hormone will still be heavily secreted, and the human body will remain in a state of tension and excitement, unable to get normal recovery, prone to blood vessels contraction and increased blood pressure, thus causing cardiovascular disease.
. . . . . . . . . . . groups with cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, family history of disease, are particularly reminded that it is easier to cause cardiovascular disease if they stay up late.
If you stay up long enough, not only do cardiovascular functions are affected, but the gastrointestinal function, the immune system, the nervous endocrine system are affected, and the risk of even tumors increases.
For older friends, Han Zhi-won suggested that he try not to spend the night watching Olympic games, especially for groups with a history of cardiovascular disease.
. . . . . . . during the last World Cup, Han Zhiyuan had received a patient in his 60s, whose heart infarction triggered or was related to the nighttime watch.

The documentary Polar is a large work focusing on the Earth's third-most Tibetan Plateau, which tells a whole new perspective of the story of Tibetan traditions blending with modern times and of Tibet's interaction with the world.
The greatest advantage of VR's work is that it gives the viewer a unique sense of viewing "simmering", which also places higher demands on the filming process.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
The incident was seen as the culmination of the Cold War, and history called the Cuban missile crisis.

On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused intense interference with the United States military radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic missile early warning system, which is used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, which was completed by researchers at the University of Colorado in the United States, interviewed United States military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analysing the Sun activities at the time, and consulted non-confidential literature.
The paper wrote that in the 1960s, in order to prevent the sudden nuclear war in the Soviet Union, the United States Air Force had always had a part of the warplane carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
The U.S. military commander did not know that the main cause of the disturbance was the solar storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the fighter to enter combat readiness.
It is fortunate that the solar activity of the United States military, which began in the late 1950s, and its study of the Earth's electromagnetic interference, ultimately prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the Air Weather Service of the United States Air Force and submitted a detailed report.
The immediate consequence of this solar storm is that the United States military has since viewed space weather as a combat concern and has established a stronger space weather forecasting system.
. . . . . . . . . during daily trips, citizens found that love cars were hampered by strange vehicles, and that in cases where no contact was made with a stranger vehicle driver, this trouble could be solved by using the "Micro-System Mover" function.

When this service is introduced, in everyday life, citizens can solve such problems by using the "Micro-System Mover" function when they encounter a strange vehicle obstructing their vehicle from travelling without the driver on the scene.
This new service function is quick and saves administrative costs; it is respectful and protects the privacy of citizens; and it is full-time, full-time service.

The mixed game that took place this day also made eight decisions, but the fall of the number one seeded mahu/Gascia group, as well as the fallout of the Nape group, caused the mixed match to lose a little bit of color.
On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly released a new edition of the United States-Japan Defense Cooperation Pointer in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role globally.
This was the day when U.S. Secretary of Defense Carter, U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, Japan's Foreign Minister Wen-hsiung Kaida and Japanese Defence Minister Nakagawa attended the press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that Chinese folk think tanks have published a Japanese military force assessment report and the fourth time that an English version has been launched.
The report consists of nine chapters, including general policy adjustments, military strength, defence budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, institutional development reform, military training, external military security cooperation, and relations with Chinese military security.
The report states that 2015 is the year in which the Abe Government has advanced major policy adjustments for several consecutive years in the area of security.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the area of security will be primarily at the operational level, such as the application of the rule of law, strategic implementation, and policy implementation, rather than the framework, mechanisms and significant adjustments and changes in policies.
The report emphasizes that the Abe Cabinet has attempted to break through the above three points to achieve the multiple purposes of promoting the "normal nationalization" of Japan, the self-defence forces going out to intervene in international security matters, strengthening the Japanese-American alliance, and defending against China.
previously, the China Society for the Advancement of Strategic Culture had issued a Japanese military force assessment report on 5 June 2012, 19 July 2013, 23 July 2014, and 30 June 2015.
The British Financial Times released a set of images of the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to China on August 12.
In contrast, according to the article, the United States Ambassador's residence, from its appearance, could well be used as a safe house in the next film adapted from the Johnlecarre Cold War spy novel.
The residence is grey and is heavily defended with perimeter fences, second-story inner walls, barbed wires and vehicle barricade layers.

The black coal yard depot, turned into a "green grass like a pine" football field; a factory at the top of the red brick, turned into a modern gymnasium.
On National Fitness Day, the South Falling Horse Camp Sports and Culture Park outside the Jiang Gate in Hangzhou unveiled the mysterious veil.
This used to be a coal farm, which remained idle after being closed more than a decade ago, leaving a large amount of illegal buildings and living waste.

The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of sport for all, which in a sense depends on sports for all, while sports for all depend on site conditions.
It is reported that, as of 2015, the per capita area of sports in our country, although 150 times the size of the New China when it was founded, still lags far behind the sports power.
In June of this year, the State Department issued the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020), which focuses on the development of mass sports.
In order to fill this short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments should take full account of the layout of the stadium when urban planning is being carried out.
. On the other hand, public stadiums that have been built, including in units such as schools, should be as open as possible and as efficient as possible in their use.
. . . . . . . . . . . . as the Rio Olympic Games are now on fire, sparking people's enthusiasm for sport and awakening everyone's sense of participation.
Gillid's got a lawyer's fee in a fight with Merk's hepatitis C patent.
According to the judgement of the United States District Judge, Gilled Science is entitled to legal fees arising out of the patent proceedings for hepatitis C with the pharmaceutical company Merk Group in the United States.
In June, after a United States judge found that Mercer had committed violations, including perjury and other immoral acts, Gillede was exempt from paying $200 million in damages arising from two patents by Gillid's best-selling drugs, Sofibwe and Havone, which violated Mercer's two patents.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . on Thursday's lawsuit, United States District Judge Beth Lamboson Freeman stated that Gillid was not required to bear the costs of his defence.
The Merk Company is trying to catch up with Gilled, who is ruling the new generation of hepatitis C pharmaceutical markets.
The case first dates back to 2013, when Gillid and Merker sued each other, and both claimed to be an effective ingredient in Gilid's drugs - the owner of the laboratory work in Sofiabwe.
US-backed troops have announced they've taken Manbiday back from the Islamic State.
The Force spokesman said on Friday that all remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city had left and that the United States-backed forces had full control of the northern city of Manbiday, near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city after radicals have left in hiding inside the city.

In 2015, the Clintons made charitable donations amounting to $1 million, most of which went to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speech fee amounted to nearly $5.3 million, while the former Secretary of State earned $3 million from publishers Simon and Schuster with a book about her while in the Department of State.
. . . . . . . . . . . . Clinton's running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kane and his wife Anne Hallton, published a 10-year tax return.
The two paid 20.3 per cent of the federal tax in 2015.
In a statement, Clinton ' s campaign assistant, Jennifer Palmieri, said that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane would continue to be financial transparency poles. "
In sharp contrast, Donald Trump covered up for false reasons and retracted his previous commitment to publish tax returns.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . as a New York businessman, Trump, and his lawyers used the audit by the U.S. IRS as a reason to refuse to publish the tax returns.
. . . . . . Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams tweeted that you were in charge, and attached a link to the tax returns of the Democratic Party candidates.
On Thursday, Trump's special legal adviser, Michael Cohen, stated to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish the tax returns until the audit was completed.
The critics of Trump, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said that Trump ' s refusal to publish tax returns would raise questions about their net capital value, charitable donations, commercial transactions and various other relationships, including with Russia.
. . . . . . Clinton seized on the issue and released a web video on Friday highlighting the high-profile Democrats urging Trump to publish his tax status.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in her economic policy speech in Michigan.
She said to people, "For decades, he refused to publish his tax returns like other presidential candidates. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . two years in the 1990s, Trump paid barely a penny, and the New York Times business columnists quoted several tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, all of whom said that the current situation might still be that way.
The federal tax has become a major issue in the presidential campaign.
. . . . . Clinton named a provision under the name Warren Buffett, a billion-dollar investor, to ensure that at least 30 per cent of the tax is paid by those with an annual income of over $1 million.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . last week Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Nebraska, where Birkhel Hathaway's company is located, and Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
. . . . . Buffett said that he was also being audited by IRS, and Trump was "feared" not by tax authorities, but by voters.
The earliest tax returns published by the Clinton campaign team were in 2007.
The average federal tax rate paid by Clintons currently residing in Chabak, New York, between 2007 and 2014 was about 32 per cent, and the combined rate was about 40.5 per cent.
The Clintons' tax returns for 2015 show that, unlike most Americans, they earn only $100 in wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons' dividends and interest income was $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticized the Berlin Hotel for removing Israeli phone codes according to Arab clients' "requests" — Reuters News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin revealed to the media that the Berlin-based Kebinski Hotel did not list Israeli telephone codes and that the hotel staff said it was a "request" from an Arab client, which sparked a great deal of public opinion.
The author of the Jewish Holocaust documentary Halo, Claude Longsman, expressed his disappointment at the Kebinski Hotel and issued an open letter in the German Frankfurt Report.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . during the recent period of residence, Longsman wanted to find Israel on the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not one of the countries where guests can call directly from their rooms.
Is it possible that Israel disappeared in Berlin, Germany's capital in 2016?
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in search of explanation. . . . . the filmmaker
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And the reason for this is to make this filmmaker angry.
And Ronzmann quotes the employee as saying: Most of our guests are Arabs, and they ask for the Israeli code to be deleted. "
According to the Nande Daily newspaper, the Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas Handelsman, referred to the matter as "surprisingly humiliating".
We were shocked to learn about the incident.
It's a huge shame in itself.
And it's all the more embarrassing that it happened in Germany and the hotel chain.
There's no need to explain this.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . we hope that the hotel will reach the correct conclusion," said the official.
The incident sparked a hot debate online, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
There are those who believe that the Kebinsky Hotel is simply a "low knee" to meet the demands of Arab clients.
The other post directly points to the hotel as "real shame" and points out that the street on the famous Kudam Street is just near a synagogue.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . according to the Mirror Weekly report, the hotel soon clarified all allegations, claiming that everything was "negative" and "apologizing" to Longsman.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in the . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The newspaper also indicated that Israeli code had been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to evict Brazilian students protesting.
On Thursday, in São Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with the police in protest against the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters.
The cause of the incident was an attempt by law enforcement officials to disperse students, so the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the march, expressing their dissatisfaction with the programmes.
In order to save money, the Governor of São Paulo, Okming, plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be transferred.
Some of the students who took part in the protest expressed their dissatisfaction with interim President Michel Temel through graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before a recent protest, protesters collectively took to the streets in support of President Dilma Rossev, who had been impeached by the National Senate.
Scottish cyclist Calm Skinner, who won the cycling gold medal, returned.
The Scottish cyclist, Calm Skinner, competed last night for the men ' s group at Rio cycling, helping the British trio successfully defend the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist, who replaced his fellow Scotsman, Sir Chris Hoy, became the team's middleman. Even this legendary cyclist was proud of him when the young Skinner defeated and returned with fame.
Four years ago, the British team sounded amazing, while Hoy took the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
The British team was only sixth in the March London World Singles Stadium Championship, and Hoy retired since then, and then the British team was brilliant again.
. . . . . . . . . . . during the Beijing to London Olympics, the British team's problem was to replace "First Circle Expert" Jamie Staff.
The convoy did so when Cinders appeared.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's coaching team insisted that he be elected to the national team, and Skinner ultimately did not fall short of expectations.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The three British bicycle races eventually defeated their opponents and won the gold medal.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The change in strategy was the key to this reversal, and Cinders chose a larger flying wheel, so the pace was slower, which allowed Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep pace.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . as the BBC commentator. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist Skinner said, "It's flattering me. "
I'm just doing my best to make myself famous.
We set the Olympic record in the final and defeated the world's champions.
It's incredible.
There's nothing better than this victory.
. . . . . . . after winning the gold medal with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 London Olympics, Cinders admitted deliberately falling on the track in the absence of a good start.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And this victory doesn't have any such problems.
And Cinders said, "It's like London, the British flag on the platform. "
We just formed a team three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world champions, so it's amazing to be able to defend the Olympic champions.
This was just a game, a gold medal, for the British team that won seven of the 10 site bike gold medals at the Beijing and London Olympics.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, then we will continue to succeed in the bike house for the next five days.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . according to Kenny's state of display, it is not impossible for him to recreate Hoy's feat of winning three gold medals at an Olympic session.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is the same as Hoy.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The 28-year-old Bolton said, "I'll focus on this game for the time being.
The team's always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
To be frank, it's a little lonely to win a man.
And Cinders said, "If he could win the other two gold medals, then he should be given the jazz seal."
This was the only game to produce medals that day, but the British team received other good news.
. . . . . . . . Sir Bradley Wilkins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doyle advanced to the four-man four-kilometre group chase at the fastest.
Their results were 351.943.
the 2012 London Olympic gold medalist's world record is 351.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today in the second round, and Wilkins will no doubt be the focus of attention for all.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the competition official before the qualifying match, when the competition official told him to measure his height.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in the women's group race, which will end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rossel Shand, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archibald from Mirgue advanced with a new world record of 41.3.260.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . after displaying its absolute dominance at the Olympics in Beijing and London, the British cycling team was somewhat disappointed during their trip to Rio.

After a small life comes to this world, the parents are responsible for it, not only for the child's physical well-being, but also for spiritual development, i.e. education.
If the child's education fails, then even if the career succeeds, it will not make up for the lack of life, the failure of the family.
When a new life comes, the new parents need to devote their time and energy to the care and education of their children and to him.

The country's capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average in recent years, and is higher than that of countries and regions such as the US and Europe.
Our country has taken firm and effective measures to overcome excess capacity, and the results are gradually showing.
The head noted that the Party's Central State Department attached great importance to the global problem of excess steel production.
The departments, the regions, actively follow up on the deployment of the State Department and work seriously to reduce crude steel production capacity of about 45 million tons this year.
In our national context, we do not encourage the export of steel, but rather take a series of practical measures to control the export of steel.
The Officer-in-Charge stressed that international trade in iron and steel products was essentially a market act and an autonomous choice that arose from the demand of importing countries, with consumers taking into account factors such as product value for money.
The implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally address the development of the global steel industry, but rather only further shocks to the international trading order.
When it came to debt, the Officer-in-Charge stressed that resolving the debt problem was an important issue that needed to be properly addressed in resolving excess capacity.
Given the size of the assets of steel and steel enterprises, the breadth of their coverage, the complexity of the debt relations of some enterprises and the potential for regional risks if not properly disposed of.
According to the director, in recent years, as the downward pressure of the economy increased, the overall demand for society gradually weakened, the utilization of productive capacity in some sectors declined, and the production of enterprises became more difficult to operate.
Some enterprises are not adapted to changes in the market environment, and production operations are difficult to sustain or are even on the verge of collapse, but are constrained by some institutional factors, with more obstacles to exit in a marketable manner, becoming "Zombie Enterprises".
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces factor resource efficiency, increases social management costs and impedes the establishment of a level playing field market environment.
The main reason for the loss is the same as the plight of the global steel industry — poor market demand and low capacity utilization.
Our country is based on market mechanisms, economic means and the rule of law approach, and the Government is primarily responsible for working hard for workers and social stability to ensure a fair and just market order.
The head stressed that the next step was to stay firm and continue to catch up with capacity work and ensure the completion of the five-year target of removing 100 to 150 million tons of crude steel capacity.
On the afternoon of 10, the Chinese tourist police, who were featured at the Moscow Red Yard, immediately drew attention, and Chinese tourists waved their greetings with surprises, and locals and foreign tourists returned to their sights.
On the same day, members of China's first professional tourism police force, the Tourism Police Division of Sanya City, Hainan Province, came to Moscow Red Field and studied with local tourism police on duty.
The Moscow Tourism Police were on duty patrol in three teams in the Red Field, Nikolisky Walk Street, Gum department store, and the Chinese Tourism Police were on duty with them for over an hour.
The female police officer, Luchine, who is in her 20s and knows English and Spanish, has just joined the Tourist Police last year.

The Moscow tourist police spoke patiently to each other in fluent Spanish when they met with Spanish tourists to consult, which impressed Wang Ice.
"Everyone in the Moscow Tourism Police masters foreign languages, and some have more than two doors, which is very touching on us. "
" Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually focusing on attracting international tourists, and we hope to improve our capacity to match the status of international tourist islands. "
On the same day, before studying with him, the Chinese tourism police also went to the Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade site to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists and see them very happy to travel to Russia. "
"The question they usually ask for is how the road goes, where a monument is, how to call a cab, and how to get back to the hotel. "
. . . . . . . . Captain Resakov of the Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade said that the urban environment and tourist climate in Moscow had become more and more attractive to foreign tourists in recent years.
In order to adapt to tourism development needs, a tourism police force was established in July 2014 to patrol and defend major attractions, assist and channel tourists.
At present, all Moscow tourist police are proficient in English and partially Spanish and German.
The Police Brigade divides them into nine groups based on the level of foreign languages, taking two classes a week to learn self-defense tactics, laws and regulations, and foreign languages.

Sino-New Network reporter combing found that rules for the implementation of residence permits were currently in place in at least nine provinces and cities, including Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian, and Beijing.
In the case of the conditions for obtaining a residence permit, the above-mentioned area generally states that it is necessary to reside for more than six months, in accordance with the conditions of legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence, and one of the conditions of continuous schooling.
The Chinese-New Network reporter noted that the treatment provided by residence permits varies "in gold" from place to place, and that the range of public services and facilities provided in some areas has expanded compared to the requirements of the national version.
All these areas have increased the facilities for children to take local high- and middle-level examinations when relevant conditions are met.
In addition, Beijing and others have made explicit calls for the progressive expansion of the provision of public services and facilities and their regular dissemination to society.
For example, Fujian suggested that the scope of public services and facilities enjoyed by holders of residence permits should be disclosed to society at least once every three years.
The Provisional Regulations on Residence Permits stipulate that the public security organs shall produce and issue residence permits within 15 days of the date of receipt of the residence permit if the conditions are met.
. Most areas agree with the national version of the time limit for issuing certificates, i.e. within 15 days.
Hebei made it clear that, if the conditions for application are met and the material is complete, the residence permit shall be issued within three working days of the date of receipt of the residence at the public security police station.
If Jiangxi meets the conditions for obtaining a residence permit and proves that it is well-documented, the public security organs shall produce and issue a residence permit within five working days from the date of receipt.
In accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Residence Permits, the above-mentioned areas are clear, and for the first time a residence permit is applied for, free of payment of the cost of work on the document.
For example, Sichuan requires that public security police stations or commissioned community services strictly enforce approved billing items and charges and firmly prohibit over-scope, over-standard or hitchhiking charges.
On July 27, 2016, Chen Yangxia, Secretary of the County Council of Dingnan, was checked to the provincial disciplinary board to serve as the head of the party's wind and wind supervision office (sub-office chief, one year's probation period).
That night's wine was provided by Le Hoon himself, and the other costs were borne by someone named Liu.
The Jiangxi Provincial Disciplinary Commission informed that Chen Yangxia, Cheng Ziyang and others had organized and accepted food at a private meeting, in violation of the spirit of the central eight rules and the discipline of the party.

The future of the Portland smelter is full of uncertainty due to the cancellation of the power supply contract
The Portland Aluminium Smelter in Victoria and hundreds of workers in the plant are currently facing an uncertain future, as the power company that powered the plant revealed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract, thereby nullifying all supply contracts.
The initiative took place after the Victorian government decided not to continue granting subsidies to guarantee plant operations.
The fixed subsidy, which lasts for 20 years, will end in November.
The 2,000 workers of the Portland factory of the United States aluminum company may face unemployment.
Once the factory is closed, as many as 2,000 people may be unemployed, directly or indirectly.

In 2014, Meluminium closed the Cape Hanley Smelter, which led to the closure of the Angelci Island power plant last year.
The American aluminum company Portland Smelter is currently in deficit and at risk of closure.
The move was made after predictions of the plant's future years, initially due to the strong Australian dollar, and more recently to the price of the plant's products.
The AGL provides power to this large aluminum smelter through the old Eyan power plant in the Ruterob Valley.The company predicts that three other plant owners will also terminate their agreement.
The largest shareholder in the plant was a joint venture between a US-Aluminium and Aluminium Oxidation, while China's China-China Chinese Shin Group and Japan's Maru Red Shield Society also held a small share.
The joint venture said, "AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand ... "
The AGL stated that the contracts were "switching contracts" that should have been in effect since November 2016.
the contract was terminated for a period of 12 months, so they would terminate in 2017.
The company said, "So, the AGL still predicts that the contracts will continue to generate revenue in the 2017 fiscal year. "
Any possible revenue impact on AGL since the 2018 fiscal year is now subject to an optimistic outlook from the futures market on the price of wholesale power generation.
The AGL stated that the company had written down the contract value of $187 million in "explosive activity expectations".
Aluminium stated that the decision to terminate the contracts "will not affect the ability of Aluminium to operate the smelter or guarantee its power supply."
The United States company stated that it had signed a 20-year contract with Old Eryan in 2010, which would have been effective in November of this year, but the company did not explain why it withdrew from the contract.
The analysts were cautious as to whether the Portland Smelter in Victoria and the Tomago Plant near Newcastle would be closed due to the poor economic situation in the industry.
In response to comments made by analysts earlier this week, AGL operations manager Stephen Miklson said Portland uses about 600 MW annually and the Tomago factory reaches about 900 MW.
If two factories are shut down, the demand for electricity markets will be significantly reduced.
He said, "It's not good news for us as a power company."
The Community Law Center shuts down 160,000 people every year.
Each year more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are turned away from community legal centres.... The funding for this service was already stretched and now facing further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people were denied free legal advice and representation services, most of them older persons, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without the resources to fight unfair evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and is now faced with further funding cuts.
Since June next year, federal funding for these legal centres will be reduced by a further 30 per cent.
According to James Farrell, the head of the Queensland Community Law Center, according to the latest National Community Association Law Center investigation report, thousands of people are denied access each year.
Mr. Farrell said that the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change existing decisions.
He said, " Community law centres in Queensland are chronically under-funded, which means that thousands of people will not be able to access the important services they need. "
The people who need to stay away from violence, those who bear huge debts that cannot be repaid, those who face disintegrated families, the squeezed workers, all of whom face problems at the legal level, and the report shows that they do not have access to the help they need.
The federal government will cut a further 30 per cent from June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Queensland MP George Brandis to rescind these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal problems.
Last year, the state government committed to raising legal aid funding to the national average.
Now it is important to focus on community law centres and their responsiveness to the needs of the community, and the Government of Baelki must also be engaged in this important work.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport.

The Olympic Games have greatly benefited Stratford and the East Side.
And we will again benefit the area by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprentice jobs, 40,000 new jobs and lift the young people around the airport out of unemployment.
The expansion of Heathrow was considered by some to be too large, as it was before the 2012 London Olympics.
I was told that Britain would not be able to prepare for the Olympics and that we would be ashamed of ourselves in front of the world.
The doubt of the challengers about the 2012 Olympics is wrong, and their doubt about the Heathrow project will also prove wrong.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most people, not a few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs, bring economic growth of £21.1 billion and leave a legacy of technology and employment around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team, which has completed a £11 billion infrastructure investment project on time and within budget, including the T5 terminal, which was elected for five consecutive years to the best airport terminal in the world, and the T2 terminal, located between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now, they are ready to build a third runway with private investment of £16 billion.
The UK successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe the Heathrow Airport expansion project will also be a great success.
Now is a good time for us to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport so that we can protect our future and create a technology and employment fortune that makes Britain proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Heathrow Airport Board and former Business Counsellor of the British Treasury.

NASA Climate Model: Once suitable for human habitation on Venus
. According to NASA's predictions of a new climate model, Venus used to be suitable for human settlement.
The NASA Goddard Space Research Institute scientists have developed a model to explore the past of Venus, which uses tools and algorithms that are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, which has a high surface temperature, waterless and atmosphere-filled carbon dioxide, has ever had an environment similar to that of Earth.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . before scientists believed that Venus's slower rotation was due to

The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
. Venus may have more dry areas than Earth, but there has been enough water and geographic changes to spawn life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the sunlight on Venus was darker than the Earth by 30 per cent.
In a press conference, Goddard Space Research Institute scientist Anthony Del Jeño explained: "In Goddard Space Research Institute model simulations, Venus slowly rotations its side for up to two months during the day. "

The result of the simulation is that Venus's average climate temperature is actually a few degrees lower than the present-day Earth.
The model simulates the evolution of Venus close to previous planetary scientists' speculations.

The ocean on the planet evaporates, and the water vapor is also burned out of ultraviolet light.
As hydrogen escapes, only the thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and deadly greenhouse gas effects remain, creating Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published the simulation results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Newsletter.

North Sea oilfield workers stopped the strike and continued negotiations
The chief negotiator said that workers in the North Sea oil fields had stopped a strike on remuneration, and the parties to the dispute had begun a new round of negotiations.
There have been several strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group on the North Sea oil platform operated by the Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement, " Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute settlement process. "
We will start early next week with a number of full-day meetings in the coming weeks to re-examine these issues.
The union stated that its recent action was to protest against a possible 30 per cent reduction in wages, which was the first time the union had taken such action in 25 years.
The Wood Group reduced the remuneration of the North Sea contractor by about 9 per cent this year due to market pressures.
Before this reduction, the company reduced the remuneration of the maritime contractor by 10 per cent in 2014.
The company said that a further reduction in wages would help the company to get through the market depression.
The Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries, as the company needed to streamline its operations following its merger with the British Energy Corporation British Gas Group.

In his statement, Dave said, "In the North Sea and in the country as a whole, we need an economy that serves the majority rather than the few."
In 2016, expenditure on new projects in the North Sea is expected to not exceed $1.4 billion, compared to average project expenditure of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the star of the constellation.
This latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete rotational speed of the star of the star group.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the stars of the cluster have different rotational speeds and the correlation of the rotational cycle to the composition of the planet.
The research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing Analysis at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Lusa Rebour, said in a press conference, "We want to learn more about the relationship between star mass, age, and even the history of its solar system by comparing our results with other clusters. "

"The Ancestral Cluster laid the foundation for a two-way rotation theory model of young and old stars. "
We still have a lot of knowledge to know about how, when and why the stars slow down the rotation and "take away our own dance shoes".
Rable and her colleagues elaborated on their latest analysis of the rotational speed of the Ancestral Stars in three new papers, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
