New issues in California waterworks.
After a major water management area in California revealed that the administration, led by Governor Jerry Brown, would provide government funding to complete planning for two giant water tunnels, some commentators and a state councillor said that they wanted to know more about who would bear the cost of the Governor's proposed $16 billion waterworks.
The reviewer said that the government funds mentioned on Thursday at MWD in Los Angeles might be contrary to the state's long-standing commitment that, in order to realize the two 35-mile long tunnels envisaged by Brown, to facilitate the passage of water from the Sacramento River to the south and to supply it primarily to the central and southern regions of California, the local water pipelines (rather than California itself) would bear the costs.
The $248 million initial cost expenditure of the two tunnels has been the subject of an ongoing federal audit without the approval of the regulatory authorities.
A number of state councillors also ordered a state audit of the cost of the tunnel on Wednesday.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The opposition to the tunnel project and a group of taxpayers, however, made criticism Thursday, and Susan Egerman, a member of the state legislature behind this week's audit order, asked the state government to clarify the situation on Thursday.
And David Wolfe, the legislative director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, said, "It's a hoax. "
I think that for yesterday's audit (request): there are far more questions than answers.
The tunnel project is supported by Brown and some politically influential water management areas and water customers in central and southern California.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The opponents expressed concern that the state would divert too much water from the Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay through these two tunnels, thereby causing damage to northern California and, in turn, threatening the survival of the species there.
The water management areas of major cities and other water management areas that are expected to fetch water from tunnels have not yet made a commitment to cover the costs, owing to uncertainty as to whether this huge expenditure will actually bring them enough water to reduce the price of water.
These water management areas also declared this year that they would not bear the cost of completing the current initial work until the project was approved by the regulatory department.
On Thursday, a monthly report published by the Los Angeles Water Supply Management Area on the tunnel project stated, "The state has indicated that any additional funds required to complete the planning phase will be provided by state or federal funding. "
According to Los Angeles Water Management District spokesman Bob Muir, after all local water management districts invested in the project (including $63 million from his water management area), "it can be expected" that the state will use government funds to help complete the planning phase.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The opponents of the tunnel project, however, instead resorted to a bill passed by state councillors in 2009, which they said prohibited the state from investing in these tunnels unless the water departments benefiting from it committed themselves to bearing the cost of the tunnels.
The long-standing opponents of the proposed tunnel, Patricia Schifferer, environmental adviser, said: "The project contractor, who had promised to bear the cost of the project, has evaded this obligation through financial tricks. "
So, the question is where exactly the money can be delivered.
Business group petitioned China on cyber security law
A coalition of international enterprise groups called on China to change the proposed cybersecurity rules and warned that they would undermine trade and isolate the country.
The 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America co-signed a letter to Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, which reflects the level of global concern that the relevant cybersecurity rules may restrict or prevent access to Chinese markets for information security products.
The signatories include the United States Chamber of Commerce, the European Forum on Services and several groups from Japan, South Korea and Mexico.
• China's proposed cybersecurity rules will require suppliers to demonstrate the working methods of safety products to the relevant Chinese authorities and to store information on Chinese citizens in China.
The latest letter issued on Wednesday states that this may make the data easier to steal and may reduce access to Chinese clients.
Tianjin chemical explosion: one anniversary of the deadly disaster
Zhang Manfan said the public should know what happened in Tianjin's bombing.
The Chinese leaders may wish to commemorate in a silent manner the first anniversary of the chemical explosion that killed 173 people, but not everyone thinks so.
Please look at John Sudworth's report from Tianjin.
If such a magnitude disaster occurs anywhere else in the world, the anniversary will almost always manifest itself as a profound national reflection.
It's not the same in China.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . that day . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Communist-controlled media were told what could be said and what could not be said, while some survivors and relatives of the deceased were warned not to mediate.
Zhang's 23-year-old, however, is reluctant to remain silent.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . this anniversary should have a way for the public to understand what happened," he told me.
I don't want to be silent.
On 12 August last year, Mr. Zhang was a radio caller for the fire brigade attached to the army, which was only one kilometre away from the bombing centre at the fire station.
He said, "The phone was called at 10:53 p.m., and then we started sending my teammates."
It takes them 10 minutes to get to the scene.
The firefighters from other parts of the city also arrived to cope with the fire at a chemical depot.
All of them may not be aware of the large amount of volatile and toxic substances stored in the site violation, which is far more than allowed and is not properly managed.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Subsequently, the fire spread to areas where a large number of (800 tons) ammonium nitrate fertilizers were stored.
The ensuing explosion destroyed the windows of the fire station and caused the roof to collapse, and Zhang Manfan was waiting for reports from the fire scene next to the radio.
But those reports will never come back.
"When I saw the mushroom cloud, I fell into despair," he said to me.
I know what it means to my friends.
The same night, his fire station sent 26 firefighters to the fire scene, eight of whom never returned.
Many of the surviving firefighters suffered severe burns and other injuries.
. . . . . . . . the largest explosion was observed as an earthquake in two large explosions, and the blast shock was still felt many kilometres away.
The total damage caused by the disaster was more than $1 billion, including more than 300 destroyed buildings.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The remains of eight of the victims were never found.
The official government findings attributed responsibility to corruption, political relations and the collusion of officials, which led to obscurity and disregard for the security system.
The warehouse should not have been built as close as a residential building in the first place.
There are more than 100 officials and business executives facing some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Therefore, while the Government can point to progress made, such as the rehabilitation of thousands of homes and compensation for residents, there are still lingering sensitive issues.
The disaster exposed the rift of a system in which rapid economic growth was prioritized and the lack of independent oversight was an indisputable fact.
The bravery and sense of responsibility that night was unquestioned, yet the side of firefighters' image as heroes was another sad picture.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Zhang Manfan has now left the fire department, but will attend Tianjin's memorial ceremony.
He will deliver a word to his lost comrades in his heart.
What I'd like to tell them most is: I visited your parents, and they're all fine.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm your family.
I'll do my best for you.
The cold spring may affect the Scottish pine hunting season.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. In an opening address for the pine chicken hunting season, the Scottish Hunting Ground Caregiver Association stated that pine chicken hunting could sustain more jobs than major Edinburgh festivals.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The organization ' s director, Harry Hayton, said, " Maintaining the abundance of birds and birds in the hunting grounds for hunting requires a lot of work and always involves some highly controversial practices. "
This is no wonder that the public is gradually rejecting this so-called mode of movement and calling on the government to view it as a cruel and unnecessary practice for some very small Scottish people to entertain.
The landowners, however, insisted that they were committed to protection and that pine chicken hunting was essential to the rural economy.
According to Alex Hogg, president of the Scottish Orchestra Caregivers Association, the industry maintains 8,800 full-time jobs per year in remote areas and has become a "job-intensive belt" for some uncertain periods.
He said, "Scotland has no innate ‘hunting' culture compared to many other European countries, and many people do not understand the economic impact of the hunting season on the country. "
Mr. Hog stated that the number of full-time jobs dependent on hunting exceeds the sum of jobs created by Edinburgh International Arts Festival, Edinburgh Edge Arts Festival, Disaggregated Performances and New Year's Eve Events.
He added: " There are real concerns about employment in the rural areas of Scotland at this time, especially in the oil and gas fields, so hunters and their families want to see the industry grow. "
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that hardworking people can continue to rely on these jobs in the future.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds of England believed that eight golden sculptures were illegally hunted around the pine chicken hunting grounds.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The opening day of the pine chicken hunting season has traditionally been called the "Twelve Twelve".
The recreational activity, however, remains controversial, and the management of the pine chicken hunting grounds has been labeled persecuting the Raptors by some wildlife conservation organizations.
on Thursday, according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds of England, in less than five years, eight gold sculptures with labels disappeared in the Monaria Mountains, located southeast of the city of Inverness.
The wildlife charity believed that the gold sculptures had been illegally hunted around the pine chicken hunting grounds, while their satellite tracking labels had been destroyed.
The Scottish Minister for the Environment, Rosana Cunningham, said that the reports were "very disturbing and disappointing".
Ms. Cunningham has instructed the officials concerned to analyse signs of some 90 surviving and missing eagles to determine whether there is some pattern of suspicious activity.
The Scottish Hunting Ground Group accused the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds of trying to raise anti-hunting emotions before the pine chicken hunting season and stated that there was no precise evidence that the Raptors had actually died in the Monalian region.

I didn't think I'd get the medal, but I did my best, so I'm happy that all the training and hard work paid off.
I'm happy to be in the final with Catherine, and as long as one contestant goes to the final, we make history, and we have two.

The Highlands and the University of the Isles, the Inverness College course, failed on a massive scale.
The entire class of 20 students may no longer be able to pass the examination for higher media courses administered by the Inverness College of the University of the Highlands and Islands.
The majority of students in the course are 17 and 18 years of age, hoping to enter the university on the basis of the achievements made in their studies.
The Highlands and the University of the Islands, Inverness College, stated that the school's quality assurance process was functioning normally, in addition to the survey being conducted by the Scottish Education Management Board (SQA).
A spokesperson for the Scottish Education Management Board said that the 2016 high-level media rating nationwide had been "on schedule".
All twenty students enrolled in this course, which was managed and scored by the Inverness College of the University of the Highlands and Islands.
Many of these students are young people from rural areas who receive online instruction, but must also travel frequently from their place of residence (e.g. Lohaber) to this college in Inverness.
The father of one of the students said that after her daughter posted her homework on social media without any credits, at least 10 other students also appeared to indicate that their course homework did not receive any credits.
He told the BBC News Network Scotland Online that about five other students studying the same course at Inverness College at the University of the Islands in the Highlands last year also contacted them about the same situation.
This situation means that his daughter is not able to secure admission to Glasgow University, but because she has attained some qualifications during her studies, she will have access to the admission opportunities offered by another university.
The girl's father, however, said that the other students who studied the college's media programme were less fortunate, that they were now "suffering" and that it was uncertain whether their course operations would be re-examined and awarded a score sufficient to allow them to enter the university.
The Inverness College is a University of the Highlands and Islands affiliated college.
The Dean and CEO of Inverness College, Highland and Island University, Diana Rawlinson, said, "We take students ' exam results and academic achievements very seriously. "
The excellent HMIE report we received earlier this year and the continuous progress we have achieved in the fields of continuing and higher education over the years are proof of this.
As we do every year, we are reviewing all published results and comparing them with the expected score for each student.
For this particular course, there is a regular quality assurance process implemented, and points are awarded to institutional reviewers who recently reported that "there is a significant advantage in the award and management of the credits" and confirmed that "the assessment judgement made is in line with national standards."
At our request, the Scottish Education Management Board is currently investigating the matter.
A spokesperson for the Scottish Education Management Board said, " We are pleased that the 2016 high-level media assessment, as expected, provided candidates with the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the subject. "
The performance of many candidates was strong, and we saw a small increase in the A-C compliance rate in the context of homogeneity compared to last year.
The design of the examination is consistent with past and sample tests and with our curriculum and rating norms.
The brothers in the Kilmanok sword "Blood" case were sentenced to imprisonment.
Jason Braden was attacked with a samurai knife, a dagger and a double truncheon.
The two male suspects were imprisoned on charges of drug-related robbery and subsequent "bloodwashing" in East Alshire, killing a male with a samurai knife.
The victim, Jason Bryden, 38, was repeatedly stabbed on 5 July 2015 when he was attacked at his home in Kilmanock.
At Glasgow High Court, James Clark, 36, charged with murder, and sentenced to at least 22 years in prison.
His brother John, 38, was charged with lesser manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
In sentencing the brothers to prison, Judge Bill Dunlop noted that they had carried out "a brutal, ruthless, brutal attack."
He refused to accept any argument that Mr. Brighton had been waiting for them to appear with a samurai knife.
Judge Dunloop added, "You conspired to break into the house using at least one dagger and two interception sticks. "

And you killed him.
After the two men were sentenced to prison, Detective Inspector David Moran, who was in charge of the investigation case, said: "The brutality of James Clark and John Clark led to the death of Jason Brighton. "
It's heartbreaking to be killed at the age of 38 and in such appalling circumstances, while the families of the victims are forced to endure.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . according to statements previously heard by the court, the brothers from Kilmanock decided to take Mr. Bryden's gold bracelet, which they had delivered to him in exchange for the cost of the drugs.
The two went to the victim's home after drinking and drug use, masked with a scarf and held a dagger and a martial arts double-stopstick.
The sword used to kill the jab is believed to be the object of the dead.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in addition to stabbing wounds, Mr. Brighton also suffered blunt wounds during the attack.
Three days later, he died at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock.
The brothers deny murder.
At the time of the testimony, James Clark, 38 previous convictions and one attempted murder, said, "I didn't intend to do it. It was an accident. "
. . . . . . . 23 times John Clark of the ex-conviction said that he had been involved in the matter only to help his brother, who claimed that he was being attacked by Mr. Brighton.
Men are jailed for shaking their young children so hard.
. . . . . . David Sinclair admitted killing his child in 2012 at his home in East Kilbred.
The man who shook violently and in a moment's anger because he would not feed, and thus killed his younger son, was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.
On 6 December 2012, at his home in East Kilbred, South Lanarkshire, David Sinclair rocked Joshua in a state of "one moment out of control" only four months old.
The cause of death was discovered only after a case evaluation by medical experts.
The 34-year-old Sinclair was initially charged with murder, but after pleading guilty, he was sentenced to minor manslaughter.
When the Glasgow High Court sentenced him to prison, Judge Lord Brackerdale said to Sinclair, "You have attacked him through your son, who is still in infancy, causing him fatal injuries. "
You must have known you were shaking at him, but you didn't reveal it.
It's only after a lot of medical research that you admit to what you've done.
Your wife trusted you.
Now she feels misled by you and can't support you anymore.

The court had previously learned that, on the day of the child's death, Sinclair and his wife, Christie, had taken Joshua for a swim and then went to East Kilbred shopping.
At 17:30, Christy Sinclair went out to find her mother and sister.
just 11 minutes later, she received a call from Sinclair, whose voice sounded "stunned."
He said to her, "Joshua is not breathing well, come home now."
He then hung up and called 999.
The baby was taken urgently to Hermels Hospital, where it died.
At first, Joshua's death was not established, but the medical team reviewed the case and found evidence that the eye and brain had trauma caused by non-accidental circumstances when they approached the time of death.
Dr. Pete Richards, a consultant to paediatric neurosurgeons at Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, said, " This evidence shows that the baby has suffered a greater degree of shaking than is normally used in everyday life. "
The defence counsel, Royal Legal Adviser Ian Dugt, said to the Tribunal that Sinclair was "extremely remorseful" for what he had done.

It was a great experience, and I was a little disappointed in the fourth grade.
I lost my hand with the medal, that's a dream.
However, entering the final is a great experience in itself, and I will be encouraged by it for years to come.
It's a little frustrating, but it'll make me stronger in the future, and it makes me more eager to win the medal, hoping that next time I'll be closer to the medal.

She explained: "If someone does not like it and disagrees, they can go to the International Sports Arbitration Tribunal and express it. "
I don't support the use of stimulant nor have I ever used stimulant.
The latter is not my fault at all.

Ben Plaud's 50 metres free swimming final.
. . . . . . . . . . . . early on, Ben Plaud advanced to the men's 50 m free swimming final with a break in the English record.
The 21-year-old Commonwealth Games champion, Plaud, swam for 21.54 seconds to advance to the Friday final (02:44 a.m. Saturday at the British Summer Hour) in fifth place.
Your delegation is rude and rude.
The Indian Minister of Sport, Vijay Gore, was visible at the Rio Olympics, often appearing on the stands to fuel Indian athletes and to take a self-shoot after the match.

On Wednesday, after Gore and his attendants attempted to break into the restricted area of the gymnasium and the fencing and taekwondo fields, Olympic organizers sent a letter warning that if Gore does not make any further improvements, he would be disqualified.
In the 2016 Rio Group Continental Manager Sarah Peterson wrote: " We have received numerous reports that your Sports Minister has attempted to break into the area of the stadium where unauthorized people are required to enter. "
The staff reported that when they tried to explain that the situation was not allowed, the Minister ' s line became aggressive and rude and repeatedly pushed the staff to break in.
The letter goes on to say, " If our ceremonial team learns again of such acts, your Minister of Sport will be disqualified and his privileges at the Olympic Games will be revoked. "
The head of the Indian delegation called the incident "originally not a problem but it was treated as a problem", while Gore himself stated that he had done nothing wrong and attributed it to a "misunderstanding".
He tweeted, " As far as I know, we've always followed all the rules and regulations."
We are committed to the Olympic spirit and we support our Indian players.
If not, this would be a frustrating Olympic Games for India, with no medals yet.

The Indian women's gymnast, Dipa Kamaka, who competes alone, will take part in the horse-to-horse finals on Sunday to show off her aweless flip for two weeks of "The Jump of Death" and the other athletes rarely try to do this pova jump action.
The low number of medals in India is always surprising for a country with a population of 1.25 billion.
The analysts say there are many reasons for this phenomenon.

The parents have traditionally placed more emphasis on schooling than on sports.
And the governing body of sports has been plagued by corruption.
In 2012, the Indian Olympic Association, in violation of the IOC statute, elected a leader to carry criminal charges, and the IOC suspended the Association.
At the Sochi Winter Olympics, three Indian athletes were not even allowed to represent the country, carrying a flag and wearing insignia.
They can only attend the Winter Olympics as independent athletes.

The DEA missed out on the chance to break the ban on medical marijuana.
The answer is sad: it's not possible.
This is a missed opportunity that could further delay the potential treatment required by countless people.
As of today, there is only one research-level medical cannabis source approved by the Federal Government, at the University of Mississippi.
There is a seemingly positive news today that the DEA has announced that it will now allow other places to apply for approval of similar practices.
It is hoped that the amount and variety of cannabis used for scientific research may be expanded.
While this move will be hailed as a victory in the field of research, it is primarily symbolic, since no matter how much marijuana is available, if it is still difficult to access, it makes little sense.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In response to the demand for this product, someone made an inexplicable decision to make more products but still not to open that locked door.
It's the product, and it's designated a controlled substance that's the locked door.
That's the problem with medical marijuana.
Since cannabis is a controlled substance (meaning that it "is not currently recognized for medical purposes and has a high potential for abuse" as required), important obstacles still need to be overcome in order to open this door.
The researchers who may be required are usually the first to go to the DEA, as the department is required to grant a licence to start scientific research.
Even after a licence has been granted, in order to study a controlled substance, research institutions must install heavy safes and advanced security systems, which will cost a lot.
There is also a more subjective consideration that the study of a class of controlled substances can only be carried out with the approval of the academic institution in which you are located.
Even if individual teachers want to carry out such research, the university leadership may not want to cause trouble or potential impact as a result of negative reporting.
This happened at the University of Arizona, when Dr. Sue Heathley was dismissed after he sought a medical marijuana test.
In April, seven years after the original development of the research project, Heathley finally had to seek private funding for its project, and her pilot project became the first medical marijuana experiment to be approved by the DEA for the study of post-traumatic stress disorder treatment of veterans.
Then, after several years of institutional obstacles, the National Institute of Drug Abuse of the United States took the last key to the lock.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Even now that more medical marijuana has been liberated for research purposes, the agency will have to approve any research it finances.
The problem, however, is the last word in its name: "abuse".
In my interview with Donald Abernance of the University of San Francisco for the documentary Weed, he said that one of the main responsibilities of the Institute was to study potential substance abuse rather than to study it as a drug.
In the words of Abrams.
Even if a research customer has served all the above-mentioned obstacles, as long as the purpose of the study is not the harm but the benefit of medical marijuana, the door may not have been opened.
Think about it: a (unscientificly) quick search of the National Library of Medicine in the United States shows that there have been 1434 papers on cannabis for medical purposes in the past five years.
The results of that search also revealed that only 57 papers dealt with the benefits of medical marijuana.
The majority of papers study the harms of cannabis, such as "bad experiences caused by the neural signaling effect of cannabis", "hannabin induced pancreatic inflammation" and "the use of cannabis and the risk of lung cancer".
This imbalance reflects a highly deceptive picture.
The path to medical marijuana research is paved by surprises and hypocrisy everywhere.
The United States Department of Health and Human Services holds a patent on the widespread medicinal use of cannabis, just as the DEA continues to maintain a classification of one type of control and sees no medical interest.
The DEA continues to list cannabis with heroin and ecstasy as a high-abuse potential drug, although Francis Young, the DEA's own former chief executive judge, does not agree with this.
In strict medical conditions, marijuana is much safer than much of the food we consume everyday.
. For example, eating 10 potatoes alive can lead to a toxic reaction.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in terms of human physical conditions, it is impossible to eat more than enough marijuana to kill.
c) The natural form of cannabis is one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to humans.
Through any rational analysis, cannabis can be used safely within the framework of the regular procedures for supervised medical care.
Once again, it's the opinion of one of the DEA's own judges.
Almost 30 years have passed, however, and almost nothing has changed.
Whether or not we are aware of this, we will accept a certain degree of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the strength to admit it, or we're so silent and staring at it that we don't seem to get attention.
However, for the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, it is worth the courage we must muster to show the truth unflinchingly.
The patient's life depends on it, such as Charlotte Figi, who needs to relieve epilepsy through medical marijuana, and a large number of other patients.
There is a plant that provides so much benefit, but is still confined behind these locked doors, which is worth discussing.

He said, "You can see how a man can completely turn over and twist everything... whatever he wants."
It seems to me that Trump is not a good thing for this country.
Two Turkish sailors were arrested and jailed for smuggling £500 million of drugs in an anti-drug operation.
The two Turkish men, accused of smuggling £500 million worth of cocaine on ships in the North Sea, were sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after the discovery of 3 tons of Class A drugs in the merchant ship Hamar, about 100 miles from the coast of Aberdeen, Mumin Shahin and Amin Ozman were found guilty in a trial before the Glasgow High Court.
It is known that this anti-narcotics operation in 2015 found the largest single-case case ever detected in Europe in a case involving a shipment of cocaine by sea.
Mumin Shahin and Amin Ozman were arrested and jailed for their involvement in a huge drug deal.
The amount of drugs seized on board is one of the largest drug-trafficking cases in British history.
The ship used to carry the poison was a Tanzanian-registered tugboat with a route from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea, where the drugs were hidden in specially modified secret cabins.
The smuggling vessel was intercepted by the Royal Navy HMS Somerset frigate and the Border Guard HMC Valiant armed fastboat.
The Glasgow High Court sentenced Shahin, 47, to 22 years in prison, and Ozman, 51, to 20 years in prison.
The judge, Lord Kincraven, said to the two criminals that the quantity of drugs was "not much larger than it was" and that drug trafficking had a ‘destructive impact' on the general population and society.
According to the judge, " you used a ship for cross-border trafficking in cocaine, and in fact transcontinental trafficking, to commit one of the most serious offences of a commercial scale. "
The judge told Captain Shahin that he was "not at the top of the structure of the drug trafficking tree" but played an important role in the crime, while Deputy Captain Ozman played a "slightly" role.
The officials on board the Hamar had received a covert report from the French National Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service, which, after docking in Aberdeen, they drilled through a steel plate to find a hidden cabin and found 128 bags of cocaine weighing 3.2 tons, estimated to have a street black market value of about £512 million.
The Royal Navy carried out a boarding inspection of the Hamar mother ship last year.
There are three tons of cocaine on board.
At the time of the raid, the ship's ballast module was filled with tons of Class A drugs.
The ship was stopped in the North Sea on its way from Bosphorus to South America.
The entrance to the drug hidden space was found under the closet of a crew dormitory, where the opening was blocked by cement.
. Shahin and Ozman were convicted of carrying and concealing cocaine on board the ship between 20 February and 23 April last year and of suspected cocaine trafficking between 21 April and 23 April.
The two have been in the shipping industry since the end of their studies, all first-time offenders, and they accept the jury's decision and still maintain their innocence.
The charges against the other four men were ultimately found to be unsubstantiated.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Jonathan Crowe, Shahin's lawyer, said that the married father with two children on his knees was an "glorious mule" (a running leg deliveryman who worked for drug dealers).
He said, "Someone was involved in the transport of drugs. "
A man who can command the ship.
. As far as the hierarchy of drug dealers is concerned, Mr. Shahin is certainly not at the top of the structure of the drug trafficking tree, but at the lower level.
The absolute amount of cocaine loaded on board means they have to be carried with cranes.
Before the drugs were placed in these boxes, the police took several days to conduct a detailed examination of the ship.
At the court hearing, it was learned that Shahin was named captain of the Hamar tugboat in February 2015.
Mr. Kro said that Shahin was "distressed" to miss the important stages of growth of his 9-year-old daughter and his 13-year-old son and "in one mind to return to his home in Turkey".
The men have not seen their families since they were detained in April 2015, and their families are running to get their visas approved.

Speaking after today ' s sentencing, the Scottish Crown acting prosecutor, David Harvey, stated: " The international drug trade knows no boundaries... and, in keeping with the natural duty to abolish the drug trade, we are working closely to ensure dominance. "
" Scotland's range of pursuits of criminals is truly global in scope, and in this case we have given a major economic blow to organized crime. "
Every cabin on this ship is stacked with drugs, including space below the deck.
This bag of contraband was found hidden in the boat's laundry room by the inspector.
Mr. Harvey added: " The case of the Hamar tugboat was solved on the basis of secret reports provided by the French authorities and was quickly coordinated by the Tanzanian Attorney General, where the ship was registered, before it could be boarded and inspected. "
" We obtained critical shipping records in Guyana, and then our investigation extended from Guyana to Spain, where we learned of the important information about the ship ' s stopover in the Canary Islands. "
We also worked with our Danish, Norwegian and American counterparts to put together specific elements of evidence.
Although there is credible information that the Hamar is carrying a large quantity of drugs, the British authorities cannot board and inspect international waters without the permission of the Tanzanian Government, which has never had such authorization before.
The head of the International Justice and Organized Crime Department of the Crown Prosecution Service of Scotland, Sue Patten, said: " The criminal justice advisers accredited to Tanzania by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office have acted quickly and precisely, with the approval of the relevant Tanzanian authorities, to be able to board and inspect the ship within 24 hours of receiving the information. "
Under international maritime law, the United Kingdom cannot board and inspect ships bearing foreign flags in international waters unless it is permitted to act under specific laws of the State.
If it wasn't for our criminal justice advisers to act quickly, the ship would probably have escaped, and we would not have been able to bring these people to justice.
The Rotten Eastern Express in the eyes of photographer Brian Laumen.
These are photographs of an abandoned train taken in Belgium by the photographer Brian Laumeen, who currently lives in Rotterdam.
Photos show the train rusty, broken seat, dust-covered window and a narrow room for the pilots.
This is the car that was dubbed the Eastern Express, but it belongs to the Belgian state operator.

The 40-year-old photographer Brian Laumen, currently living in Rotterdam, took pictures of these weird things, showing rusty appearances of abandoned trains, broken seats, dust-covered windows and floors, as well as a narrow crew room.
Train cars and locomotives abandoned for decay at a Belgian railway station, but attracted city explorers.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . from 1883 until 2009, when it operated in its legendary reputation, those trains were once a luxury symbol.
This locomotive was adopted by the Belgian National Railway about 50 years ago.
The last train service, named after the Eastern Express, ran from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, after 126 years of running on the railroad, and has since ended a brilliant history.
The Eastern Express, which operates between Paris and Istanbul, is well known.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in 1883 when the International Sleeping Company began operating the train line, it was called the "Fast of the East".
In 1891, it was known as the Eastern Express, and by the 1930s, regular operating services covering all of Europe had begun.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The number of international sleeper cars still alive is extremely small.
This picture shows that the equipment in the narrow pilot's room is rusting, the meters are not removed and the wire is naked.
According to Laumeen, this crew room appears to be "a bit claustrophobic, and the locomotive must be very loud."
These abandoned locomotives and cars have become a popular attraction for photographers and explorers.
After Belgium visited these forgotten trains, Laumeen said to the Daily Post Network tourist channel, "I can really feel the light on the train 's use in the full-time. "
On the journey, rich gentlemen with high hats accompanied by beautiful ladies in clothes.

Lancashireshire's father was denied access to his children's school because of his dirty-mouthed T-shirt.
The father of two children on his knees was barred from attending the school where his children were based because he appeared in offensive sweatshirts on his children's sports days.
Craig Macbeth, 36 years old, lived in Burnley, Lancashireshire, where he said he "incidently" had put on that coat with the slogan "Let's get out there and t**t it".
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The single father was a four-year school director at the Park Elementary School in Cohen, Bernley City, and because of this ban he was unable to pick up his children, school staff even called social services and police.
. Craig Macbeth, 36 years old, who lived in Burnley, said he had been barred from entering the school grounds since the day of his child's sports with this offensive T-shirt.
Mr. Macbeth accused Principal Sarah Mitchley of overreacting.
He said he was unjustly punished for having missed the T-shirt in a rush to watch the two children's race.
The father has now resigned from his position as a school director, and he says, "It was a mistake and it was my own negligence."
I didn't think it was a sports day when I put on that dress.
At the end of the sport of that day, we had a father's race, and the headmaster noticed my T-shirt and said it wasn't right.
I apologized, and I put that dress back on, and I thought it was over.
The 36-year-old father, however, stated that he had received an e-mail from the school's chairman later that evening asking him to interview the headmaster the following day, but he did not think that was necessary at the time because he had already apologized.
Mr. Macbeth added: "The principal then called me and said I was forbidden to enter the school premises. "
I found out that after that campaign day, some parents went on Facebook and made some fuss about the matter, so it attracted the attention of many.
As long as there's reason to think it's an over-reaction.
Mr. Macbeth, editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said that he believed that because of this ban he could not even pick up his children on the last day of the semester.
This, however, prompted schools and social services to make calls.
The hit T-shirt had a picture of Craig Charles playing the character Lister, which came out of the popular BBC comedy film Red Dwarf, with a character's iconic phrase, "Let's go out and t**t it".
He commented, "I told them I couldn't go because they banned me from school."
Then I got a call from the social services agency asking why I didn't pick up my daughter.
The school also called the police because I haven't picked up my daughter since almost 40 minutes have passed.
Mr. Macbeth claims that he was told he was no longer allowed to enter the school premises and that the ban remained in force until further notice.
He said he was also warned that he might face a fine of £500 if he was found trespassing.
The head of the park's primary school, Sarah Mickey, says it's over.
"I can confirm that Mr. Macbeth has resigned and is no longer a director of this school. "
It's over now, and I look forward to returning to normal school life in September.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He said, "We all have to remember that when you take on roles like parliamentarians or school directors, it means you have to discipline yourself at a higher standard... Unfortunately, he failed to meet that standard this time."
Councillor Jonathan Nixon added that he had no idea the school would ban him from entering, and the situation was exaggerated.
And Nixon added, "He was stupid in that T-shirt, and he apologized. "
The Lancashire police confirmed that they had received a call from the school but were not present.
Sixty-five percent of the Venezuelans want Maduro to be deposed, the question is whether they're willing to fight for it.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans wanted to remove President Nicolas Maduro, but the question seemed to be whether they were willing to fight for it.
The day after the National Election Commission announced that there was no time for a recall vote this year (and thus guaranteed Chavezist control until 2019), the people of Caracas remained the same, as if nothing had happened.
The 36-year-old office clerk at Altamila Square, who was resting on Wednesday, Rafael Dejan, said, "I didn't hear about the news, because I was watching the Olympics and seeing how Michael Phelps put two more medals in the bag. "
The Altamira Square, located in the eastern part of the city of Caracas, was a concentration of violent riots in protest against the Maduro regime at the beginning of 2014.
Now, however, not all the people of the country show the same enthusiasm when more pressure is needed from the opposition to bring about a referendum this year than ever before.
And Dejan said, "I want to hold a referendum, but I won't protest for the sake of security."
Other wiser people are willing to mobilize in the future, but admit that Venezuelans are not motivated enough.
The comments of the Chairman of the Electoral Commission, Tibise Lucena, are proof that the Government is obstructing the process of recall.
And Robert Toreyes, now 60, told Fox Latin News, "I'll join the protest as long as the opposition calls for a protest, but I know some of my friends are scared."
So, in addition to the many obstacles put forward by the government to delay the referendum, the opposition now faces another challenge: mobilizing people to go to the streets to protest.
Until recently, the initiative of the referendum received considerable support, and the number of people mobilized at the stage of the collection of signatures reached unprecedented proportions.
However, when protesting the Government's drills to block this effort, the rallying crowd appeared to be very small.
" Some people focus on making food, while others are scared by the many arrests and deaths that took place in 2014. "
Following Lucena's announcement that the next step in the referendum process (i.e. the collection of additional signatures throughout the country) would have to wait until October, those opposed to the socialist government in the country declared that President Maduro and his followers were trying to quell the will of Venezuelans and convince them that it was almost impossible to hold a vote this year.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . if the referendum was held in 2017, Maduro might be forced to leave his post, but he would be allowed to appoint a successor.
However, if he was deposed this year, he would have to call for a general election.
The United States Department of State referred to the issue in a statement on Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure that the Venezuelan people exercise their constitutional rights.
The statement states: " The remaining steps to achieve the presidential recall of the referendum need to be clear, concrete and implemented without delay, thus contributing to the speedy and effective resolution of the political, economic and social problems in the current Venezuelan State ... "
The political analyst Luis Salamanca, who was a member of the Electoral Commission from 2006 to 2009, said that change could not happen soon.
He told Fox Latin News, "I don't think there will be a referendum this year unless there is a much larger social unrest and protest. "
In his view, Lucena and the Government were breaking the law, but as long as the people did not protest sufficiently strongly, they might eventually achieve their purpose.
The opposition has called for a major rally to be held in Caracas on 1 September, calling for the acceleration of the process so that the recall vote can be held this year.
On that day, we wanted people from all over the country to come to the capital city to mobilize.
"The government will feel the pressure," said Eredia.
But Salamanca thinks the situation can't wait that long.
The expert told Fox Latin News that "they should respond more quickly and strongly to Lucena ' s announcement, which actually wiped out the referendum. "
Members of Congress, Eredia, acknowledge that some parties within the opposition are anxious to facilitate the rally as soon as possible, but other groups wish to have more time to organize.
Now the opposition must be careful.
According to Salamanca, "If people are frustrated by the situation, there is a risk that the number of participants in the second round of signing petitions will decrease. "
The referendum process must be supported by 20 per cent of the country's electorate, i.e. nearly 4 million people, in order to be effectively activated.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Some people, however, are less optimistic.
Our party wants political change this year.
Eredia told Fox Latin News, "If the government shuts down this election path, we'll have to explore other legitimate options. "
British Super League 2016-17 season pre-review 19: West Bromwichs
The Guardian press forecast ranked 14th. (Note: This is not necessarily Alain Smith's prediction, but is the view of most journalists in this newspaper.)
14th place last season.
The odds of winning the tournament (by Oddschecker statistics) are 1,000-1.
The new season, the old one, and until last week, the West Bromwichs seemed to be the same: the 2016-17 season, led by the traditionally pragmatic Tony Price, could be another comfortable or stalled season, depending on the degree of modesty.

Mr. Ry removed Plyss' concerns, and the entrepreneur also stated that he wanted to maintain the club's culture.
In taking over the club, Mr. Lai said, " I don't want to change the character of the club, nor do I want to make unsustainable waste. "
I want to be a good Easter and make a long-term investment in this club.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . our goal is to ensure that we remain in the ranks of the British Super League, and then on this basis, I hope the club's ranking is in the top half of the team.
I believe it's the best football league in the world, and I hope to lead this club as far away as possible.
According to Price's records, the first aspect should not be a problem.
The next goal is to reach the first half of the rankings, but for the new Dong family and increasingly divided fans who aspire to a fast uplifting ranking, it is important to realize that this is also an increasingly demanding task, as other teams in the list are also catching up recently.

Only the Aston Villa bottom team scored fewer goals than they did, and it is worth noting that during Christmas, the West Bromwichs averaged less than one goal shot in 90 minutes, at one point being the worst performing team in the area.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in 38 games, they had 13 scoreless, and scored more than one in only nine.

It is no wonder that there are frequent disgruntled reactions on the mountain field, probably the most notable of which is the poor performance of the 0-0 draw with the Aston Villas at the end of January, where the guest team looked worse.

This Northern Ireland foot did well in the European Championship, and the Fessy Bromwich Club would not release people without a large transfer call.
. Ben Foster's goal was reliable, and they were well placed in the middle field.
Quite similar to Evans, Darren Fletcher also had ample evidence that he was still playing a high competitive role at the age of 32, while Claudio Jakob was underestimated.

This forward is undoubtedly gifted, and as Pulis has mentioned many times, everyone has come together to pull him together, but it has been made clear that it is not possible to get him by relationship alone.
The West Bromwich Club insisted on signing a replacement to release the former English footer under the age of 21, although their plans to invite Dyafla Sako to join the team were stalled a few days before the transfer, which the club said he had passed a medical examination and everything met the requirements, but he suffered a back injury, which meant he would miss the start of the season.

He'll look back for those players who have been tested and tested, but Lecco does deserve attention.

This season's situation can be judged by their opening performance, and as of mid-October they are going to run for the seven matches they're supposed to win in Manchester City, Liverpool City, Tottenham City and Leicester City.
By that time, the pressure on Pulis would either be released or become more difficult.
And even Bellasino would probably find a new club. Who knows!
The trustees supported pension reform, and the Tata Steel UK Aid Agreement will be reached.
The post-Tata Steel UK pension trustee said that the programme might be reorganized and would not enter the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of the company entering into an aid agreement.
The British Steel Pension Scheme's debt of £15 billion, a fiscal deficit of up to £70 billion measured by some indicators, has become a serious obstacle to reaching an aid agreement between Tower Steel UK and the Port Talbot Steel Plant in Wales.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . after several meetings with the Secretary of Commerce and the Pension Regulatory Authority. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The company plans to merge its European operations, including British companies, with the German enterprise group Tisenkchuber.
The terms of the aid agreement, however, are that the British steel industry pension scheme needs to be reorganized and that the Government needs to provide financial support.
The Chairman of the Pension Trustee, Alain Johnston, said that the scheme could avoid falling into pension protection funds if the interests of workers were revised.
While the program is well funded compared to other programs, reducing the deficit to £300 million on certain targets, Tata Steel and the Tison Kruber Group are keen to bring debt under control.
Johnston stated that it would be "unreal" for the trustees to admit that any buyer of the joint venture or Tata Steel Britain to bear the costs of the current and future deficits.
He added that the modification of the planned welfare arrangements was a more attractive option than the inclusion of pension protection funds, as pension protection foundations reduced the treatment of workers.
. . . . . . . . . . . sources of Tower Steel warned that the company was still likely to sell the Talbot Port factory.
The company has refused to provide guarantees for the future of those steel mills since the start of negotiations in March on the future arrangements for its British company, which has been used as leverage for bargaining with the British Government.
The executive director of Tata Steel Europe, Kushko Chatage, said that the Indian consortium wanted to make its steel business "more sustainable".
The Chatage spoke on the sidelines of the annual meeting of Tata Steel in India, saying that negotiations on a reorganization of the pension scheme were progressing, but he insisted that the scheme was sufficiently funded.
According to the Times of India, Chatage said, " We are discussing with a variety of stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders such as the Welsh Government. "
There is a consensus that pensions have a certain impact on commodity businesses such as the steel industry, so we have to seek a structural solution that does not affect the further development of businesses.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Possible changes to the programme include how to measure annual inflation-related increases in benefits through the retail price index to the lower consumer price index, and limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law.
Johnston added: " The trustees and their advisers are tata steel, and the Government and pension regulators provide strong evidence that the programme is able to pay modified benefits indefinitely and achieve low risk outside the pension protection fund. "
Our investment strategy means that the financial position of the programme has not been affected by the recent decline in the rate of return on national debt, as has been the case with many other British pension schemes, and we believe that the programme can provide modified benefits on a self-sufficient basis, as it has been developed.

The head of the secretariat of the China Banking Association said that asset hosting had become an important link between the monetary market, capital markets and the real economy, as well as an important institutional arrangement to guarantee financial security.
With the rapid development of our direct financing and wealth management markets, the market position of asset trustees is increasing.
The China Asset Trust Industry Development Report (2016) data show that as of the end of 2015, the country had had a stock of 62.74 per cent, compared to only 17.11 per cent at the end of 2011.

It is worth noting that at present our asset hosting mechanism is not sound, and many areas do not strictly apply the hosting mechanism, or even are included in it.
The absence of asset hosting mechanisms is an important reason for borrowing by the P2P network, the outbreak of risk events in areas such as private equity funds.
The report recommends that the whole-agency, all-asset, all-process "all-host" model be achieved as soon as possible in order to better safeguard financial security and safeguard investors' interests.
All P2P platforms are now required to draw on large reserves of risk, as assets, which cannot be offset after the battalion has been increased.
In recent days, our city has held training sessions on the topic of fiscal taxation in the Internet finance industry, and fiscal experts have recommended to the Shenzhen Internet finance business.
At a training session organized by the Shenzhen City Internet Finance Association and co-sponsored by the Shenzhen City Association of Registered Taxpayers, many of the difficulties that my city's mutual money companies face in fiscal matters have become a focus of attention.
" In the prevailing wind of industry run, the P2P platform extracts large reserves of risk, which are undoubtedly an important means of stabilizing investors ' hearts and minds. "
The president of the Shenzhen Guangcheng Financial and Tax Service, Hu Myeong Peng, said that it was a significant tax to pay VAT if it was not paid as a reserve for the company's own withdrawal of risk.
" But if, in consultation with the insurance company, such a product is established by the insurance company, the P2P platform can be purchased and used for the value added tax credit, and the cost of the enterprise will be reduced. "
The Hu Ming Peng suggested that Shenzhen, as an Internet finance pioneer city, could be a forward-looking attempt by industry associations in consultation with insurance companies.
The current A stock market has a new drama: the big disc weighs 3,000 points in one look-out, and behind this, on the one hand, there is still a low level of occupant sentiment, and on the other, foreign investment buys A shares for seven months in a row.
The stockholders, Chen, told the Wuhan Evening Reporter, "I'm not confident enough about the situation above 3000, and I'm still afraid of the new stock of Big Emergence."
The core change in the market is that the A stock market, after experiencing extraordinary fluctuations in 2015, entered the shock market, that many events remain unresolved, and that the market's financial landscape as a whole continues to be weak and makes money very difficult.

Zhongqing Hong Kong United (Beijing) Corporation, Century Tianlong Hotel Corporation, after agreeing that Dong should fulfil his obligations under this agreement, petition the public security authorities to dismiss the case and no longer hold Dong concerned legally liable.

In October 2015, the two parties to the letter of agreement — China Wei and Dong Zi — will bring the other two parties to the letter of agreement — China Qing Hong Kong United (Beijing) and the Tianlong Hotel Company of the Century to court.
The defence replied that a judicial audit conducted by the public security organs resulted in the appropriation of more than $29 million by Dong and the accountant.
In February 2014, Dong took the initiative to contact the Qingkong Union (Beijing) company, and the two sides signed a "letter of agreement" during negotiations in the conference room of the public security organs.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to the plaintiff's agent, it was disputed whether the act of "borrowing" was a crime that Dong had asked a lawyer.
. The Protocol was signed on the premise that it was established that one of Dong's crimes had already been committed as misappropriation, contrary to the provisions of article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The prosecution of criminal liability and the transfer of shares fall under different legal categories, and the two cannot be confused, untradeable, much less "exonerated", and the "letter of agreement" is a legitimate form of concealment of an unlawful purpose.
The plaintiff party argued that criminal liability was a State public power exercised by statutory organs of the State, such as the Public Prosecutions Act, and was not subject to private agreement.
The agreement signed by the parties on 24 April 2014 violated the mandatory provisions of national laws and regulations and violated the public interest of society.
Therefore, the agreement to "renunciate the criminal liability of the other party" has no legal effect, regardless of whether or not Dong constitutes a crime.
According to the defence's representative, the nature of the "agreement" is that the criminal proceedings are under way, and the suspect has a civil understanding with the victim.
The "letter of agreement" was established and implemented in order to maximize the economic losses of the victims, so that suspects could receive light penalties, not for illegal purposes, and not in violation of the mandatory provisions of the laws and regulations.
The conclusion of the "agreement" is a genuine indication that the seal is legally valid by the signature of the parties.
The defence argued that the offences of "job appropriation" and "misappropriation of funds" were public prosecution cases, and that it was up to the public security organs to decide whether or not to withdraw the case, rather than to report it.
The letter of agreement is merely an agreement, and after the completion of a certain performance of the agreement by Dong, the victim applied to the public security authorities for the case to be dropped, without any conflicting with the exercise of the State public authority to prosecute the crime.
At the same time, the Court held that the liability for breach of the agreement went beyond the liability of the ordinary civil agreement; the validity of the agreement should be reviewed in criminal proceedings.

After a long exploration, we found that China's firm confidence in its move towards modernization was rooted in the "spiritual genes" of the Chinese nation.
In Xi Jinping's speeches and expeditions, there are countless accounts of good traditional culture in China, including Confucian thought.
In the eighteenth collective study of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party, Xi stressed that China's present day had developed from yesterday and the day before.
He also said that for thousands of years, the Chinese nation had followed a path of civilized development that was different from that of other countries and peoples.

The Disneyland spokesman, Ms. Susie Brown, said: "The East Gate Project is part of our major investment in the city of Anaheim, and as we continue to expand the Disneyland Resort, it will provide more tourist parking and help alleviate congestion in the resort. "
Four people were killed as a result of a bomb explosion in the tourist attraction of Thailand.
After voters voted for the adoption of a new constitution supported by the military government, a series of bombings targeting tourist hotspot destinations took place in five southern provinces of Thailand on Thursdays and Fridays, killing four people and injuring several others.
On Thursday night, the Hua Xin's beach resort was first attacked by two explosions, followed by another on Friday morning.
The town is approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok.
The police said that the first explosion had killed a Thai woman and injured 20 others, 10 of whom were foreign nationals.
The authorities confirmed that there had also been a number of bombing attacks in the southern cities of Puji, Dongry and Warren.
There were two bomb explosions in the town of Barton in Pugi, and two other explosions took place in the Tooth Climbing House in the tourist area adjacent to northern Pugi city.
Over the past 24 hours, a total of 11 bomb explosions have occurred in Thailand.
Colonel Quesana Patanacharon, an officer of the Royal Thai Police, said on Friday that the bombings had nothing to do with Islamic extremism, but with deliberate vandalism at the local level.
He said, "It's too early to rush the conclusion."
We are convinced, however, that these events are not directly related to any type of terrorism, and in fact they are deliberate acts of vandalism at the local level, and we are trying to find out who is responsible for the incident.
The investigation officer collected evidence from the crime scene following a small bomb explosion in Hua Xin on 12 August 2016.
On 12 August, officials stated that a series of bomb attacks against vital tourism in Thailand had resulted in four deaths and that the authorities were busy identifying the motives of the incident and finding the perpetrators.
No conflict in Thailand can cause terrorists to breed on the ground.
So we can say that these events are not terrorist attacks," he added.
No organization has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks, and no particular group has been accused by the authorities, although the bombings took place in the same week as Thai voters voted for the adoption of the new constitution.
The three southern provinces where Hua Xin, Puji and Gymnasium are located are opposed to a referendum supported by the military government, and these Muslim-majority southeastern provinces of Thailand have had rebel activities since 2004 and have resulted in the deaths of more than 6,500 people.
These bombings took place on the birthday of Queen Shriji of Thailand and on a public holiday in the country.

Signs of Ukraine: What is Vladimir Putin doing?
It's hard to judge what the truth of these claims is.
Ukraine denied it, while the United States and the European Union stated that Russia had not provided any evidence.
The Digital Forensics Research Laboratory (an open source analysis organization) found some signs of an exchange of fire on Saturday, but Moscow's exaggerated rhetoric had little basis.
The Russian distortion or misrepresentation of events for political purposes is well known, especially in the mist of the continuing conflict in Ukraine.
This doesn't mean that Russia's claims are all hypocritical.
Last year, Ukrainian civilian armed forces destroyed power towers that supplied electricity to Crimea, and some of them were also involved in criminal offences and human rights violations.
It is not impossible to make an attempted attack in Crimea, although there is little reason to doubt that the Ukrainian government will support such a plot.
No matter what happens, images discovered by the open source analyst show that Russia's military presence in Crimea has been escalating since at least Saturday (before the so-called attack).
These images show heavy weapons escorting troops moving on the peninsula, including coastal defence missile systems.
The familiar but disturbing Russian escalation.
Some reports indicate that the Russian army in Crimea has long planned a new rotation at this stage, which will help explain the activities in question, although, by coincidence, this coincided with the most tense period of the situation since the misappropriation in 2014.
No matter what happens this weekend, Mr. Putin's statement against Ukraine has undoubtedly escalated, choosing to use this episode (whatever its true extent) for some greater purpose.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In February 2014, similar statements and military exercises provided cover for the seizure of the peninsula by the Crimean volunteer militia, while the Crimean peninsula remained under Ukrainian control, with the result only showing that the militias were in fact special forces of the Russian military occupation.
In August of that year, as Russian-backed separatists retreated at the East Ukraine Festival, Mr. Putin stationed his troops along the border, warning that they might need to "protect" Russian civilians in Ukraine, who he said were being attacked.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What exactly did Mr. Putin plan in Crimea?
Some want to know if Moscow could launch another intervention in the plot.
The war in Eastern Ukraine has escalated, as it did before the August 2014 invasion.
However, this apparent similarity may be the focus, intended to create fear of military action rather than actual action, which will allow Mr. Putin to have a significant leverage in his games with Ukraine and Western countries.
The professor of Russian affairs at the University of New York, Mark Galeoti, noted that the use of Crimea as a build-up site for military operations against Eastern Ukraine was meaningless, that Eastern Ukraine was adjacent to mainland Russia rather than Crimea, and that the defence situation in other parts of the country was better.
Mr. Galeoti said, "The Russians can't be really planning some major offensive. "
On the contrary, "what we see is a Russian classic strategy to create tension."
Through the international peace talks mechanism on Ukraine, Mr. Putin has forced his Western leaders to avoid engaging with him because of Russia's annexation of Crimea, which has become increasingly futile.
By taking advantage of the new threats of unresolved conflicts, Mr. Putin provided a new reason for such talks: to persuade him to stay on the cliff.
Turning to the next peace talks planned for early September, Mr. Galeoti said, " It's a standard Putin tactic that he wants to take advantage of before he comes to the talks. "
The only real advantage is to say, "I can make things worse and worse as long as I want."
Positioning with Western bargaining
Mr. Putin also said this week that the continuation of negotiations during the tense period in Crimea made no sense, forcing the others to persuade him to return to the negotiating table, thus putting himself at the centre of such a process.
In fact, what does he get to do that?
First, it allows Russia to continue to claim that it is a world power, even if its enemies are smaller than Australia.
Secondly, this has placed Moscow in a position of veto over Ukraine's sovereignty, leaving the country under some Russian control.
It also served Mr. Putin's long-standing desire to enter into a major deal with the United States, and logically to settle disputes between the two sides over Ukraine and Syria on terms favourable to Moscow, and to put an end to Western sanctions against Russia.
Since the collapse of Russia ' s enemies in late 2014, Mr. Putin has repeatedly suggested this goal, largely due to the decline in the value of Russian oil and gas exports.
. . . . . . . . . since his involvement in Syria last fall, he has invited the great Western powers to join him as a great ally against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may believe that they need to ensure that such a deal is reached before President Obama leaves office in January.
Russian officials tend to see Hillary Clinton as a possible successor and become more hostile to Moscow.
. . . . . . . . . while apparently friendly to Russia, Donald Trump is still seen as unpredictable.
Mr. Galeoti said, however, that Mr. Obama was considered to be a man "in search of a solution, not a conflict."
So, there's a feeling that the window of opportunity is closing, and there's a need to speed up the completion of some things.
At the same time, if no major deal has been made, Mr. Putin is also pleased to let Russia's vulnerable neighbors guess what will happen then.
An earlier version of this paper misspelled the year of Russian invasion of Ukraine's annexation of Crimea.
It's supposed to be 2014. It's not 2013.
Congress is in a stalemate. The White House has set aside funds to fight the cards.
The Obama administration said on Thursday that it was releasing $81 million from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health care programmes to develop a baccalaureate virus vaccine because Congress had not approved the new funding needed to deal with the virus.
In a letter to members of Congress, the United States Secretary of Health and Public Service, Sylvia Matthews Powell, said that, if the money was not released, the United States National Institute of Health and the Biomedicine Senior Research and Development Administration would run out of funds allocated at the end of the month to deal with this mosquito-borne disease.
The vaccine development will be suspended at a critical stage due to a lack of funding at a time when local cases of infection of the caucasian virus in Miami are on the rise.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of last week, there had been 7,350 cases of baccalaureate cards in the United States, most of them in Puerto Rico.
According to Ms. Powell, 15 babies have already been born with congenital defects caused by the baccalaureate virus.
This virus can cause brain development abnormalities and other serious defects in children born to infected pregnant women.
The first cases of the disease's spread on the mainland of the United States have emerged at the end of last month, with a corresponding increase in political leverage surrounding the federal government's response.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . on Tuesday in Winwoodwoodwood, Wewoodwoodwood, this week . . . . .
President Obama and the Republicans of Congress have been dissatisfied on the issue of the baccalaureate virus for most of this year.
In February, Mr. Obama requested an emergency allocation of $1.9 billion.
The Republicans rejected the request, asking for more detailed accounts on the whereabouts of the money.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Last month, the Democratic Party rejected a proposal made by the Republicans to allocate $1.1 billion to combat the baccalaureate card, but included provisions prohibiting the funding of family planning associations to provide virus-related contraceptive conditions, which could be transmitted through sexual channels.
This impasse prompted the White House to release $589 million in April from the Ebola virus research fund for the fight against the baccalaureate virus, about two thirds of which was earmarked for use in the United States.
On Thursday, Ms. Powell said that her department had used a large half of that money and would be running out of it all by the end of August.
Ms. Powell wrote: " Because of the failure to adopt an emergency additional allocation to deal with the baccalaureate virus, the Government was forced to choose between delaying the development of key vaccines and diverting funds from other valuable government projects to avoid delays for the time being. "
The Democrats used the announcement to accuse the Republicans of failing to provide additional funding to fight the baccalaureate virus.
At the press conference, California Congressman, minority leader Nancy Pelosi, called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to bring Congress back on track to push for such measures.
Ms. Pelosi said, "All possible options are being exhausted, and now we plan to go to the National Institute of Health, which is a priority option. "
Mr. Ryan's assistant said that freeing up those funds was a long-delayed step by the Obama administration aimed at extracting as much political advantage as possible from the baccalaureate virus problem.
The U.S. National Institute of Health announced last week that it had begun a clinical trial of a baccalaureate vaccine on 80 human testees and was expected to start a second trial in early 2017 in the "Baccalaureate virus-prevalence country".
However, as no further funding is available now, officials on Thursday have indicated that the study will stop midway.
Ms. Powell said that she would transfer $34 million from the National Institute of Health funds earmarked for research into the treatment of other diseases (e.g. cancer and diabetes) for baccalaureate virus research.
A further $47 million will be allocated to the Biomedicine Advanced Research and Development Authority to support drug and vaccine development in response to public health emergencies.
The money will come from a variety of accounts, including $19 million transferred from a plan to provide oil heating subsidies to low-income households, and $4 million transferred from a plan to deal with drug abuse (e.g. opioid addiction).
. . . . . . . . Ms. Powell said that even then, these additional funds could only be dealt with the next month, by which time, if Congress does not act any more, research institutions against the baccalaureate virus will have to "severely weaken much of the critical work."
Over the past four months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have spent $60 million on helping states to protect pregnant women, $25 million on strengthening state plans for preparedness and response to the baccalaureate outbreak, and $16 million on helping states create data collection systems for rapid detection of complex symptoms associated with small head malformations and other baccalaureate cards.
Thai leaders believe that attacks on tourist attractions are related to constitutional change.
On Friday, the Thai military head of government urged the national to remain patient during the investigation to determine the culprit behind the Thai series of deadly bomb bombings this week.
The head of the military government and Prime Minister, General Bayon Jaudhan, suggested that the perpetrators were "some bad people" who opposed the new constitution adopted by Thai voters in the national referendum on Sunday.
In his national speech, he said, "There are still some bad people who have been acting before the start of the referendum. "
On Thursdays and Fridays, bombs in five provinces killed four people and injured dozens of others, including in tourist resorts Puji and Hua Xin.
According to the authorities, other arson attacks in Thailand also appear to be linked.
According to analysts, these bombings did not seem to have killed many people, but rather to disrupt the tourism industry, which is one of Thailand's few economic highlights.
At least nine foreign tourists have been injured in Hua Xin.
The Senior Fellow of Human Rights Watch, Sunay Pasouk, said: " Whatever the motive, these explosions and arson attacks destabilized the military government ' s claim that the situation would remain stable after the referendum. "
These attacks created the effects of smearing authorities, intimidating the public and undermining the tourism-based economy.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The police said they did not consider the bombings to be related to international terrorism or to the long-standing Islamic insurgency in southern Thailand.
They described these attacks as "local vandalism" rather than terrorism.
The timing and location of these attacks are of strong political symbolic significance.
The bomb explosion took place as people were preparing to celebrate their birthday for Queen Sirigi on Friday, and was also seen as Mother's Day in Thailand.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The constitution drafted by the military will weaken the influence of political parties and give the military greater power, even after the military has put the government under civilian control.
The military government ensures the fruits of its victory by preventing opponents from launching campaigns against them.
In Washington, D.C., US Center for International Strategic Studies Southeast Asian Affairs expert Murray Hibert noted that the Thai military suspected that the perpetrators of these attacks were disgruntled people.
He said that the bombings were "clearly coordinated but clearly intended to create an atmosphere of terror and anxiety rather than to create large-scale destruction and casualties."
Last year, 20 people were killed in a bomb explosion in the temple of Irawan, a tourist attraction in Bangkok, most of whom were Chinese tourists.
Thai officials attributed the bombing to the fact that more than a hundred Uighurs had been returned to China to annoy Uighur militants.
. General Bhayong has been leading the military group since a coup d'état overthrew the elected government in Thailand in 2014, and he says that the bomb bombing this week has caused the Thai people to "worried".
He said, "Why now, when the national situation, the economy and tourism are improving?"
We have to ask who did it for what.
The winner's response: how does Simon Manuel's historical moment look?
Just as I got into this game tonight, I kind of wanted to get rid of the burden of the black group I had, and I came to this position with it.
But I really want it to disappear.
I'm so happy that I can inspire others and hope to advance the diversity of sport.
But at the same time, I want to be able to show up one day, not just black swimmer Simon, but more blacks, because the title of black swimmer sounds like I shouldn't have been the one with the ability to win the gold medal or the ability to break the record.
The truth is not that, I work as hard as anyone else, and I love the sport, and I want to take victory just as much as anyone else.
Colombia ' s struggle to protect non-sexist students
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Areg ended his life in a shopping mall in Bogotá, where his suicide last words from Facebook cited Pink Floyd's lyrics, "Goodbye Cruel World".
His death was the beginning of a debate this week that upsets Colombia, as efforts to secure greater rights for LGBT groups were involved in a wider political struggle that plunged the country into a polarization of opinion.
. After Areg's death, his mother, Alba Reyes, sued school officials, accusing them of deliberately excluding her only son from the group after discovering that he had a close relationship with a classmate.
One year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia issued a final ruling in support of her view, calling on schools throughout the country to develop clearer anti-discrimination policies.
The ruling was part of a series of legal victories achieved by the Colombian gay rights movement, which was celebrated earlier this year by Colombia's ruling that same-sex marriage should be legalized.
The week, however, their struggle for equality touched the wall, and the Minister of Education, openly gay Gina Perotti, became a flashpoint in a scandal during the implementation of the ruling.

Ms. Perrotti soon revealed that lie.
While the Ministry of Education provides guidance to schools on issues relating to sexual orientation and gender identity to help them take note of the decision, it does not seek to enforce the Standardized Rules.
In a Thursday interview, Ms. Perotti said, "What we want is that schools have the means to resolve conflicts. "
The dispute opened a new front in a national debate on the topic "The future of the country torn apart by the peace negotiations between the Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
The coalition of politicians against the government and the leaders of the Catholic Church mobilized at an extraordinary rate, accusing the government led by President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting same-sex unions and gender mobility.

They showed rough posters at the rally, and some threatened violence against her and her partner, former Minister of Commerce Cecilia Álvarez Correa Glenn.
In that unpleasant week, Ms. Perrotti was very patient, and she tried to clarify her misunderstandings and re-establish a constructive debate.
She said, "In part, the reason I'm strong and sober is that I know that there are children out of the closet (public recognition of sexual orientation) right there. "
It's a difficult phase, and it's a very lonely moment.
She also linked the peace process to a debate about LGBT students.
She said that as Colombians continued to weigh the benefits of reaching an agreement with FARC, it would be a turning point for this country to shake the world, and they must consider the root causes of the conflict.
She said, " Should a peaceful State promote inclusion or condone exclusion; should it give equal opportunities to all?"
While she was unhappy that she had become the object of humiliation and harassment this week, she was pleased that, in Colombia today, gay students could rise up and face her and think that they could one day become ministers.
Ms. Perrotti said, " For me, it's important for them to be comfortable and to realize that they can make use of their full potential. "
We can't wait for the next suicide to start changing.
Ensuring election network security — The New York Times
According to a news report published on August 4, "U.S. seeks ways to stop hackers from getting their hands on ballot boxes",
The U.S. Secretary of State for Homeland Security, Jay Johnson, said that the Obama administration was discussing adding additional protective measures to the U.S. electoral system.
This change may be necessary and should be considered for immediate implementation.
The diverse nature of cyberthreats, and recent indications that some external actors (probably nation-states) have shown a greater interest in the elections affecting the United States, make it urgent for the federal Government to give additional attention to the security of the national electoral system and to consider it an integral part of the key infrastructure of the United States.
No later than now, Mr. Johnson should communicate with thousands of jurisdictions in the United States that have helped to conduct the elections and provide assistance, expertise and guidance from the Department of Homeland Security.
We have different types of voting infrastructure, which puts safety and security in jeopardy, but it also tells us that the process should start as soon as possible.
The author of the article is a senior member of the House Homeland Security Committee, a Mississippi Democrat.
In recent days, the British government has abruptly announced the suspension of the British Hinkley Point nuclear power plant project with China-French cooperation, which has attracted widespread attention both within and outside the sea.
Quite recently, the British government spokesman said that the British postponement of the project did not mean that enthusiasm for China had cooled, that China and the United Kingdom were still cooperating in a wide range of areas, and that the United Kingdom would continue to seek to maintain strong relations with China.
The experts noted that China ' s nuclear power was world-leading in terms of technology, safety performance, operating experience, etc., and was relatively inexpensive.
Therefore, while "nuclear power out of the sea" will be tested by wind for a certain period of time, the trend towards mutually beneficial cooperation will not change under the vast co-win potential.
The British performance on the Cape Hinkley nuclear power plant project is clearly difficult to describe.
When the project is completed, it will cover 7 per cent of the UK ' s electricity needs; while 9 million tonnes of CO2 will be cut annually during the 60-year operating period.
The analysts are generally of the view that the complex factors such as the exposure of the UK's own economic risks, the increase in domestic political differences, the cumbersome follow-up procedures for the de-European Union and the increased uncertainty of the future together constitute obstacles to nuclear power projects.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the same time, following the adoption of the Deutsche referendum, the United Kingdom would then face a series of de-European procedures and would rationalize its relations with European Union countries such as France.
Suh Mingsai said that although the attitude of the new British government to "distinguish" from the previous administration was clear, it did not negate the positive significance of nuclear power projects.
However, in the last 20 years, the development of nuclear power in the United Kingdom has stalled, and most of the 15 existing nuclear power plants have reached their design life.
The British Energy White Paper predicts that only one nuclear power plant will be in operation in the United Kingdom by 2025, when the power supply will face a major shortfall.
It is for this reason that there is widespread concern about the suspension of this project in the United Kingdom, which concerns the well-being of the population.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . Liu Xiaoming said that the project had only to be successfully launched to provide early security, reliable and sustainable energy for the United Kingdom.
According to industry sources, the nuclear power plant project will not only help the British people reduce the cost of electricity use, but will also drive the local economy and generate employment.
Therefore, if the new British government eventually makes decisions from the perspective of maximizing the well-being of the population, the prospects for nuclear power projects are not pessimistic.
The British can alleviate the energy demand gap, and the Chinese and French can find markets for their own superior technologies and products in the field of nuclear power for the benefit of more people ... "
The high level and mature experience of Chinese nuclear power technology is certain, despite the increased uncertainty of the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant project.
In the case of the Chinese "Walong One" that entered the British nuclear power market as planned, it was designed to integrate the advantages of other advanced nuclear power technology designs and draw on past experience.
For example, in response to the problems reflected in the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, China designed a "steam generator second-side inactivated residual heat excretion" system, which allows for the timely discharge of core heat, thus avoiding core melting.
According to Liu Xiaoming, China has been developing nuclear power for more than 30 years, maintaining good operating performance and safety standards, and achievements in nuclear power development and regulation have been highly valued by international agencies.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It is China's hope that the British government will continue to support the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant project and take early decisions to ensure its successful implementation.
The Co-Chair of the Center for Economic and Strategic Studies in Central America and Europe of the Chinese Institute of International Trade, Ho Wei Wei Wen, did not seem to have much time left for the British to make a decision, and the Chinese and British should take the necessary contacts and communication.
" The Central Asian nuclear power plant project has also been put on hold since Argentina ' s change for president, but after a positive advance, it is now explicitly planned to start next quarter. "

The ninth China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week has officially entered its duration since August 8 and will host 70 events throughout the year.
During the previous opening period, government officials from China and the 10 ASEAN countries, university principals, expert scholars, etc. had effectively exchanged information on education development plans.
In addition, it is worth noting that the second "China-ASEAN Round Table of Ministers of Education" has also been a meeting of the 11 Ministers of Education six years later since it was convened.
This year is the "China-ASEAN Year of Educational Exchange" and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of a dialogue between China and ASEAN.
In recent years, China ' s exchange cooperation with ASEAN countries in various fields has deepened and cooperation in education has been continually generating highlights.
It is understood that at the educational exchange weeks organized by both sides for many consecutive years, nearly 800 cooperation agreements have been signed, which are constantly achieving co-operation and win-winners in the humanities exchange.
The ninth China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week and the second China-ASEAN Round Table of Ministers of Education as flagship projects for the Year are of particular interest during this year of exchange.

The successive "China-ASEAN Year of Educational Exchange" added closer regional educational cooperation objectives to the construction of the "China-ASEAN Destiny Community".
"China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week, played an irreplaceable role in deepening the humanist exchange between the two sides, establishing the bridge of the mind, the bridge of friendship, and the bridge of understanding. "
Today, there is a sharp increase in the level of attention to tumors, which may be highly correlated with the high incidence of cancer in recent years.
According to the 2012 cancer report, there are about 3.37 million new cases of cancer and about 2.11 million deaths per year.
cancer has become the first cause of death in our country, with one quarter of the global cancer deaths.
The cancer is the uncontrolled growth and diffusion of cells, which can affect almost any part of the human body.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
c. Cancer is a genetic disease, but research has found that only a small proportion of cancer is genetically transmitted.
. Many factors influence the occurrence of cancer, of which environmental factors are most important and can be changed.
The environmental factors include smoking, infectious factors, radiation, pollution, and food, nutrition, physical activity, etc.
The doctor told his family that Master Li was suffering from severe dehydration due to diarrhoea, resulting in a high permeability coma, which was in critical condition and could kill him a few minutes later.
According to statistics, about 20% of diabetics may have symptoms of diarrhoea, mostly in untreated or poorly controlled blood sugar.
Some diabetic patients even have chronic diarrhoea as their first symptom, with a high degree of confusion, leading to omissions and misdiagnosis.
. Diarrhea caused by poor digestion improves the condition of anorexia, nausea, and assisted digestive medicine; bacterial diarrhoea generally has an acute condition, several times a day with abdominal pain, and can largely heal with short treatment.
c. Diabetes, however, are mostly characterized by stubborn diarrhoea, no apparent abdominal pain, and test feces with no associated infections, but the number of diarrhoeas is significantly higher, up to more than 20 per day.
In addition, side effects such as abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea can occur when certain sugar relief drugs, such as a two-and-a-decident or alpha glucose enzyme inhibitors, begin to be taken.
This is because, after diarrhoea, there may be stressful hyperglucose if there is inflammation, while hypoglycemia occurs when the stomach is pulled.
And, as diarrhoea causes stress in the human body, releases multiple hormones and, while combating diarrhoea, mobilizes a lot of blood sugar, which can also cause ketone acid poisoning in serious cases.
Therefore, after the diarrhea of sugar buddies, in addition to medical treatment for the causes of the disease, the following points should be noted.
A diabetic patient with acute diarrhea must first prevent dehydration, so it is important to drink more water, which naturally drains more urine, both for the release of excess blood sugar and for the discharge of the ketone.
But don't drink caffeine-containing drinks because caffeine stimulates gastrointestinal creeps to increase diarrhoea.
. Blood glucose-regulated imbalances during acute diarrhoea in diabetic patients must be closely observed, preferably measured every 3–4 hours.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved a transgenic mosquito field test in Florida in the southeast.
This transgenic mosquito can help control the spread of mosquito-borne infectious diseases such as baccalaureate viruses, Dengue fever and Kikonkenya fever.
The preliminary environmental assessment report published by the U.S. Drug Control Agency in March this year also concluded that such mosquitoes would not significantly affect the environment.
But the report also notes that this is not the same as authorizing this transgenic mosquito to be used for commercial purposes.
. Oxford Insect Technology must also comply with other federal, state and local government regulations and decide, along with its local partner, the Florida Islands Mosquito Control Area, on the timing of field trials.
In Brazil, Panama and the Cayman Islands, experiments have shown that this transgenic mosquito can reduce the number of mosquitoes in the test area by more than 90 per cent.
The use of genetically modified technology "to extinguish mosquitoes" is also controversial, and some experts believe it will have an unknown impact on the environment.
In addition, the province of Anhui has established an early warning system for the monitoring of priority drugs, regularly publishing and informing a directory of high prices, high volumes of use, and non-therapeutic auxiliary drugs.

According to the Swedish Daily News, identity theft has become one of the fastest growing crimes in Swedish society.
The theft of identity is a form of crime in which someone else's identity information is obtained illegally to impersonate someone else's gain.
The Sifo survey data show that 1/4 of the respondents have disclosed personal information in e-mail, mobile text messages or other social media over the past 12 months.
The president of the Swedish insurance company My Safety noted that one of the reasons for the high incidence of identity theft was that people were not careful when using personal information, leaving criminals with space for drilling.
It is reported that the Swedish police have invested considerable resources in combating identity theft since this summer.

According to the Swedish Daily News, the market for first-hand rental houses in all major cities in Sweden is on fire.
The latest data show that, in almost a year, the waiting time for first-hand rental housing was extended instead of being shortened.
In particular, the waiting time in the capital city, downtown Stockholm, and in the immediate suburbs was extended by up to two years.
At present, the average waiting time for a first-hand house contract in Stockholm City is at least 16.5 years, while the average waiting time for a first-hand room rental source in the immediate suburbs of Stockholm is also over 13 years.
The head of the market at the Swedish Housing Authority said that the market for first-hand rentals in Stockholm was short of demand, that line-up hours were growing too fast, and that waiting time for the house to be sourced had reached its highest point in history.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

According to the Swedish Daily News, it is estimated that it will be possible to apply for rental housing in 130 years if the current tempo is followed.
The data for the last 12 months show that the housing crisis is not just a phenomenon in a city in the capital city of Stockholm, but that the waiting time for first-hand rental housing in Gothenburg and Malmö regions has been extended to varying degrees.

According to the Japan Current News Agency, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will not attend the controversial Tokyo Yasuku shrine on the occasion of the Japanese defeat of the Second World War.
On Thursday, however, the Japan Current News Agency reported that Abe planned to offer sacrifices to the Yasukuni shrine on Monday to commemorate the anniversary, in accordance with established practice.
The shrine is dedicated to 14 Japanese leaders convicted of war crimes and is thus regarded by China and South Korea as a symbol of Japanese wartime militarism.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . since December 2013 Abe has not personally travelled to the Yasukuni shrine, which he said he attended in order to show respect to those who gave their lives for the country.

Police report: two suspects arrested on suspicion of plotting a plot against the Rio Olympics
The police arrested two men on Thursday on suspicion of planning an attack that might have taken place during the Rio Olympics in support of the Islamic State.
The police arrested 12 people in a Thursday operation, and they were all suspected of collaborating with Islamic State militants.
According to the Brazilian Federal Police, three others were released after questioning.
Both of the men arrested on Thursday were Brazilian, but the police did not provide their names or other detailed information.
While Brazil has no record of any conflict with known armed groups in its history, the Government has stated that the Olympic Games have made Brazil a likely target (under attack), particularly in the participating countries, which include countries that are fighting the Islamic State every year.
The Islamic State militants controlled parts of Iraq and Syria, and the United States-led coalition carried out air strikes against them.
The group's supporters were spread around the world, and they carried out shootings and bombings against civilians.
New suspects in the murder of the French priest were formally charged.
police sources told Reuters on Friday that a French priest had been killed last month and that an official investigation into a man arrested on Monday had been initiated as part of the investigation into the case.
According to the source, the 21-year-old suspect was accused of collaborating with terrorists and planning attacks on the population.
The man had telephone contact with Adel Kermić and Abdou Lemalek Paddy, who broke into a church ceremony site and cut the throat of 85-year-old Roman Catholic priest Jacques Hammer on 26 July in the town of San Etienne Durufray in western France.
Both of the killers were killed by the police.
The source revealed that, a few days before the attack, the suspect had travelled from his home near Toulouse to the town of St. Etienne Durufray and spent the night there.
The source said that the young man had no criminal record and that he admitted to spending the night there, but told the investigators that he had left the following day because of his disharmony with Adel and Abdou.
The investigators are trying to determine whether Kermich and Paddy Jean were complicit in France and whether they had any links with Islamic State militants, who claimed responsibility for the attack.
A watch (chamber) relative of Paddy Jean was also taken into preventive custody at the end of last month.

And when it comes to the word "national foot", Daebao, if he is injured, will certainly influence the 12 major races that will take place in half a month.
In this week's round-up at the Chinese Amphibious 0-0, Dabao suffered injuries, and he and Paolinio fell doubles in a fierce stride, resulting in a neck injury.
The serious injury that occurred in Han-Hong in that game was all the more moving, and conservatively estimated that it would take four months to resume, which means that Yu-Hong would be absent from at least the first half of the 12 strong races.
If the injury to Daebao is also more troublesome, the configuration of the front-fielder will be greatly affected.
However, engineers at the University of California, Berkeley, took the concept one step further by developing a very small wireless sensor to detect health conditions in the human body.

This will probably provide a way to treat disorders such as epilepsy or activate the human immune system.
This device has been implanted into the muscles and ending nerves of rats and uses ultrasound as an energy source and reads the data collected.
The sensor has been reduced to a cubic mm and is called "neurodust", which contains a voltage crystal.
The author of this paper explains that this transistor transforms the ultrasound vibrate that is emitted outside the human body into electricity to drive a tiny transistor within the vehicle, which is directly connected to a nerve or muscle fiber.
The peak of voltage within the fiber causes changes in current circuits and crystal vibrations, so that echoes are detected by ultrasound receivers (currently still primarily the source of ultrasound vibrations).

Massey's gonna shut down 100 stores.
The department store giant Macy said on Thursday that the company planned to close 100 stores, a major initiative aimed at helping the chain out of a potentially serious problem: the company claimed that there were too many physical stores in the United States in the era of shopping on the Internet.
. Massey makes regular adjustments to the flag-down store portfolio, often closing dozens of underperforming shops immediately after the annual vacation peak.
In a summer announcement, however, the company announced that 15 per cent of 728 stores under its flag would be closed.... This chain seems to be taking a more radical stance than many retail counterparts, reducing the size of the shop to deal with the rapidly changing shopping environment in reality.
The pedestrians travel with the shoppers in front of a Macy department store door in New York.
The retail giant said it was planned to close 100 stores.
There are many reasons for Macy's department stores to try to change: many of the stores under the company's banner are located in small, regional shopping malls, where the flow of people has been severely damaged by the rise of e-commerce.
Moreover, as shoppers are increasingly inclined to go to discount retailers (e.g. T.J. Maxx) and fast fashion companies (e.g. H&M) to buy their clothing, this retail type of department stores is generally in a struggling position.
These factors, together with some short-term problems (e.g. the decline in international tourist consumption and the untimely weather), have caused Macy's department stores to go through a difficult period of more than a year.
On Thursday, the company stated that comparative sales had fallen by 2.6 per cent in the last quarter and had weak performance, although there was still an improvement over the previous quarter's poor performance, which was 6.1 per cent lower than the previous quarter.
The retailer earned $5.87 billion ($7.64 billion), a 3.9 per cent decrease over the same period of the previous year.
. . . . . . . . Massey department stores say that the closure of these stores may reduce annual sales by about $1 billion.
In the past, the closure of such a large number of stores may be seen as a compromise made by retailers as a result of the failure of their operations.
The company's stock surged by 17 per cent on Thursday, however, showing investors seeing the move as a positive initiative that heralded a stronger performance for Macy's department stores in the future.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in some respects, Massey's cuts should not be
. . . . Macy's department chief executive Terry Lundgren once said that the chain was just too many stores.
The senior management has been saying for some time that they are developing a strategy that focuses on about 150 of the best-performing stores, trying to squeeze out more sales in those locations where they do well.
In a statement, Macy department executive Jeff Ginet, who would replace Lundgren as CEO in 2017, said that all of the stores that the company planned to close were stores where sales and profits had been declining.
"We recognize that the return on investment in these locations is insufficient and often fails to demonstrate the customer shopping experience that we expect the Macy department brand to represent. "
The company said it would provide a list of stores that would be closed.
. Massey said that the company was still making a final decision as to which stores to close, so it was not yet possible to determine exactly how many jobs would be cut.
The retailer will not withdraw completely from any of the first-class malls in which existing stores operate, but will seek to close those that are in underperforming locations.
The move may not be good news for shopping centre operators, who rely on large tenants like Macy's department stores to attract and retain other smaller stores to operate in the mall.
Did you hide dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to the new findings, in terms of the amount of bacteria you will be exposed to, drinking from water bottles that can be reloaded may be "more bad in many times than adding to your dog's toys."
The website called Runner Review commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 water bottles of four different types (including spin caps, slide caps, squeeze caps and straw caps).
Each water bottle is used by an athlete for a week and is not cleaned.
Your refillable water bottle may be as dirty as a dog's toy.
"Based on the 12 water bottles tested, we find that reusable drinking water containers can contain an alarming number of living bacterial cells: more than 300,000 units per square centimetre of bacteria (CFU) formed. "
The test found the highest bacterial content of the slide-covered water bottle, with an average of more than 900,000 units per square centimetre of bacterial formation.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The second is a squeeze-cap water bottle, with 162,000 units per square centimetre of bacteria forming, while a spin-cap water bottle has a bacterium close to 160,000 CFUs per square centimetre.
The site added: "Drinking water with these bottles may be worse than eating with your pet's plate."
The test results for snorkel-covered water bottles have been much better, containing much smaller bacteria than those of other water bottles, with only 25 CFUs per square centimeter.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The bacteria in the snorkel cap water bottle are described as "normally harmless".
The site says, "Based on the results of the tests, we recommend the use of pipe-covered water bottles, which have a low bacterial prevalence and a low number of harmful bacteria. "
We also learned that stainless steel bottles are a better choice than plastic bottles in terms of water bottles and bacterial problems.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The site advises readers to clean water bottles after each use, and the preferred method is to do so with a weak bleaching solution.
Religion must be modernized or eliminated.
The U.S. Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the latest poll results remain the same at the time of the election, the first female president in U.S. history will be sworn in in January.
Last week, on the other side of the Atlantic, British Prime Minister Trisa May was negotiating with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the terms of British withdrawal from the European Union.
Women living in Western societies have been bred up to make them believe that they are capable and successful in any professional role through education, ambition and hard work.
Today, young women can use as their role models some living figures who work at the highest levels of leadership.
So, is the long and hard struggle for equal rights for women finally over?
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Well, it's not completely over.
Women's leadership remains a controversial issue in the religious sphere.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the formation of a new committee to negotiate whether women should be appointed as deacon of the Catholic Church.
In January 2015, the Anglican Church appointed Libby Lane as the first female bishop of the church, while a similar attempt in 2012 ended in failure.
While the Jewish Reform Movement has appointed women rabbis since the early 1970s, there has been a conservative movement since the 1980s, and there is still a heated debate over the idea of female rabbis in Orthodox Judaism.
In November 2015, the Orthodox Jewish Council of the United States issued a solemn proclamation that female rabbis were illegal, a third attempt by the Council to resist the growing trend in support of Orthodox women in the divinity of Libby.
It is ironic that, just as Hillary Clinton's nomination for President of the receiving Democratic Party is being submitted, a group of Orthodox American rabbis opposed to women's sacramentary positions have launched a series of "hearings" on this controversial topic.
Why is there such a gap between secular and religious spheres?
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . like most denominations. . . . . .
This is reflected in resistance to the pressures of adapting societies to change.
Those who oppose it are based on the fact that a woman's status as a saint is not in line with "traditional".
However, it is not without cost to remain committed to tradition in this way.
The cost of such fidelity may cause the traditional community to lose the oxygen on which it depends, thereby destroying the tradition itself against its will.
In the World War I military history book "August Gunfire", Barbara Tachiman emphasized the dangers of tradition through a history known as the tragedy of red pants.
On the eve of World War I, as the war evolved from close combat to heavy artillery fire from a further distance, the hidden soldiers could take the advantage for as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to this change by replacing the coloured uniform with a single grey and brown uniform.
The French soldiers, however, continued to follow the same red hat and pants, and became a very visible target on the battlefield.
The French Minister of the Army, Adolf Mehimi, suggested that his troops should do the same, which was ridiculed and opposed.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At a parliamentary hearing, former Army Minister Eugene Etienne gave a speech to France.
He shouted, "To get rid of the red pants?"
Never!
Mehemi later wrote, "blindly and foolishly attached to the most visible colours brings cruel consequences. "
The religious leaders who resist women in religious leadership roles are at risk of the same trap.
They focus only on the "traditional practices" of their religion without asking themselves the crucial question: "What changes are necessary to keep religion alive?" Their risk is to alienate 50% of the population.
They also make the entire community ostracize the talents, skills and enthusiasm that women's groups can contribute.

Charlton Arena fans only get season tickets if they sign a contract of conduct and agree not to denigrate the club on social media.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . while we recognize everyone's right to hold their own personal views, it is not helpful to post inflammatory statements on social networking sites.
The fan, who worked in administration, was then told that he had to go personally to former Chief Constable Cliff Igg to get tickets and Cliff Igg joined the club last month after 35 years of police career.
The letter goes on to say, "I need to remind you that the granting of tickets to you for the season will be `conditional' and you must sign a `contract of contractual conduct', which requires you to exercise restraint in the future, not to post derogatory or inflammatory statements against the club or its representative on any social media website, nor to make any other act that may be considered anti-social in nature. "
The fan described to the Daily Telegraph how he paid to buy the tickets for the season and then call the club, but two days later the ticket did not appear, but received the letter.
" They told me that my comments on Twitter had always been extreme and influenced the tweets of others, which I found absurd. "
A holiday ride on the Dalmatian coast.
What do you mean, extravagant?
The former U.S. Navy commander, Colin, said, "I've lost my ass. "She has just completed a 25-mile bike ride in the direction of the rugged Croatian island ridge, leaving a great deal of sweat and a string of naval spicy cries along the road.
Some bicycle riders hum their hymns or recite their children's songs to distract themselves during difficult climbs.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . others either count laps or suffer silently, thinking of how to get into what the seasoned riders call a state of disrepair.
Corinne cursed in a variety of vicious ways.
Walking a few yards from her front is like being chased by Hugh Grant in a "four weddings and a funeral" piece.
She and I were tasked with conducting a week-long "luxurious" cruise of cruise ships and bicycles on the Dalmatia coast and islands in northern Croatia, organized by Freedom Treks.
It may not be a luxury for all to ride in a steep place like Croatia, but it is said that the northern part of Dalmatia is easier to ride than the southern part, and we used a soft-seat pad, and a box was available a few months ago when we filled out the booking form with carelessness and confidence when we were able to just tick it to ensure that we were assisted with an electric bike, but we did not tick it.
The extravagant part of the deal is that we're going to live in our floating home for a week, that's the brand-new melodrama cruiser.
At the end of the ride, we can dump our bicycles at the docks, packed by our guide Ivan and Ivana. Then, we jump into the blue sea from the back of the cruise ship, the sea is clear and easy to distinguish between sea urchins, sharp rocks and other travellers, a place that the Croatians call a beach full of long strips of pails.
The temperature of this sea water at the end of June is ideal, and everyone agrees: it's cool enough to lift it, but it's not cold.
If anyone feels energetic after a hard ride in the morning, then the melody cruiser is equipped with a face mask, a breathing tube and a few kayaks.
But most of us would rather go back to the air-conditioning cabin, and Helena, the female masseur on board (I'm not kidding) would have laid our bed, replenished the food in the refrigerator, and left a new box of chocolate on the table.

The barge and bicycle holidays organized last year in the Netherlands were successful, so they decided to try more risky activities, and now they come to Croatia.
A chapel competing with their church is on a cruise ship and bicycle vacation in Provence, and every afternoon on Facebook you come to me to compete to make the atmosphere stronger.
The risk element in the holiday may be exaggerated, because if not strictly regulated, we will not be able to keep up with the schedule.
When we sailed from the beautiful old port of Trogill near Split, Ivan announced at the welcome meeting to the first arrivals: " Breakfast and dinner are scheduled at 8:00. "
The bells on the ship are ringing once to indicate that the cafeteria has started, and once after the meal is over, to say that everyone should be quiet and listen carefully to the next briefing.
I'm afraid everyone, except the British, has forgotten this harmonica.
Whatever, fun and jokes come in spite of the hand. Ivana comes up with a map of the day, and we all pretend to be convoluted around the chart, the shadow outline and the line of rise and fall are freaking out, but everything else will be a surprise for a cycling hike from the coastline to the coastline in Croatia.
Ivan said, "It's like an electrocardiogram."
The completely flat route is not within the recommended range.
Iván has been briefed with frequent switching in English and German.

We'll meet at the docks at 9:00.
Okay, so 9:05. I forgot you were on vacation.
It's gonna take a lot of water.
. . . . . . . we began a two-day north cruise from Trogill, through the Konati Islands, where we would ride a large part of the way along Dugi Otok (the "long island" in Croatian), and then wake up to roam at Traska Natural Park, appreciate the high cliff cliffs and the salt lake formed as sea water enters from underground passages.
Swimming in this lake is said to bring people back to their youth.
Would our feet be younger and stronger if involved in the water front?
On the small island called Morat, we folded again to the south, improvising between the land and the nearby islands.

This sport and the social group will organize many group bicycle rides on weekends, they understand the relevant rituals, they will make various reminders on the way and give way to the road on the ride so that the car driver can move beyond it more safely.

When it is necessary to cross the main road, we gather all together, get out of the car and walk, push the bike to a safe zone on the other side, and act in accordance with instructions and not be able to assert ourselves.
When we were standing by the road waiting for instructions to cross, a Swiss rider asked, "Do you think Ivan is aware that he is not giving orders to a group of children?"
Our afternoons aren't always free.
On our city trip to Zadar, we visited the Roman Forum remains and the sea-wave organ, the music sent out by the sea-wave organ like the moaning of the sea monster in the cage, and the music came out by opening the pipeline towards the seawater, which was set in a corridor made of stone code.
When the meal is finished with the pudding, it's a wonderful moment to appreciate Zadar's famous sunset scenery. After dusk, we return to the surfing organ and appreciate the wave-painted sidewalks that power the light, which is like the ground dancing.

The fifth day was a complete free ride.
. . . . . . . . . . . by boat to visit the Kelka River into the mouth of the sea and watch its waterfall; to visit the dome cathedral of Hibénik in the afternoon, a masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance; to walk at dusk on the calm island of Zlarin in search of locally produced corals — we have spent a very interesting day.
Lourde is ready to receive pilgrims despite the threat of attack.
. . . . . . . . . . during the annual Catholic pilgrimage to the Holy Land of Notre Dame de Lourde.
With thousands of Catholics gathered at Notre Dame Lourdes for the annual pilgrimage, French security forces were on high alert, as a series of terrorist attacks had taken place only recently.
The 15th of August is the day of the call of the Virgin Marymon to the sky, at which time tens of thousands of people gather annually to the Holy Land in the Pyrenees Mountains to commemorate the Holy Day of the Virgin.
On the occasion of this year's pilgrimage, Catholicism was adversely affected by the murder of a French senior priest, who was broken into the church in northern France and cut his throat by two Islamic extremists during Mass on 26 July.
Two weeks before the murder of Father Jacques Hammer, a Tunisian (who, according to investigators, became an extremist as a result of the online Islamic Jihad video) drove a truck into the celebration of French National Day in the coastal city of Nice, killing 85 people.
In the aftermath of three large-scale attacks in 18 months, many French now have concerns about participating in public gatherings.
The number of visitors entering France has plummeted, and the authorities are already concerned that the number of visitors to this year's pilgrimage will drop sharply.
The fear of the mass being cancelled, however, did not materialize, and some organizers said there was even a surge in numbers at the following moment.
It is expected that there will be about 25,000 believers, including Mass groups from Italy and Belgium, as well as a Christian branch Orthodox delegation of about 200 members.
Many pilgrims have said that they will not be afraid.
A 66-year-old tourist, Christian, said to Agence France-Presse, "We won't stop living." "He says praying in front of a windfall is "the only weapon."
As one of the coordinators, Mathieu Ginal said, "It's important to show that life continues. "
We can't give up our beliefs, our beliefs and our way of life because some fanatics are trying to spread fear.
Since the Nice attacks, France has cancelled a number of major events, including the large flea market in the northern city of Rille, and the European Road Cycling Championship, which was scheduled to take place in Nice in September, out of security concerns.
The priest in charge of official pilgrimages, Fabian Lejón, said last weekend: "In the past week, what worries me is that calls will be received for cancellations. "
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The head of the local hotel union, Christian Griss, confirmed that there were signs of "a growing will" to participate in the pilgrimage after the attack.
The security of the sanctuary built around the temple has been significantly strengthened. It has been reported that in 1858 the Virgin Mary was sanctified by the poor shepherd, Benedette Subiru, in the caves of the Holy Land.

She said, "It makes my three children very nervous and scared, they're familiar with Lourdes, and it's hard not to scare them when they ask why they should be so on guard."
It doesn't ruin my experience, but what makes me sad is that it is necessary to do so, and I understand that these measures reassure some.

As one of the organizers, Thierry Castillo believes that this year's rally is "a little unusual" because "the intimidation seems to have taken root in France."
However, he was sure that "it would not affect the quality and depth of the pilgrimage experience."

He said, "We reiterate what we have always said that this pool will not pose any threat to the health of athletes. "
On the day of the situation in the pool, one or two athletes complained that they felt their eyes were itching.
This is because the first reaction when we see the pool turn green is the use of chemical chlorine, which is common in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced our use.
We re-detected the pool, and the results show that the indicators are entirely within parameters.
. Simon Longford, the chief spokesman for the Marialunk Swimming Center, said that the diving pool was closed to perform additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision had the support of the International Swimming Federation.
In a statement, Longford stated, "The reason for closing the diving pool is that it must remain static so that the diving pool can return to its blue state as soon as possible. "

Andrada said, "It's raining doesn't help to improve the situation. "
He added that athletes could conduct land-based training in the morning, although it was acknowledged that such an arrangement was "not ideal".

When the pool turns green, we make another mistake.

Shanghai and Taipei will hold forums despite the stagnation of communication mechanisms between the two sides of the Strait
The Shanghai municipal sector announced on Friday that the Shanghai and Taipei cities would hold an annual city forum in Taipei on 22 and 23 August, although the Strait's communication mechanism is currently at a standstill.
The Shanghai City Government announced, through its official blog account on Xinhua Weibo, that Shahelin, a senior municipal official, would lead a delegation to the forum on behalf of Yang Hsiung, the mayor of Shanghai.
The Forum has been organized by these two cities on a rotational basis since its inception in 2010.
According to the Shanghai City Government, the 2016 Forum will focus on exchanges in the areas of health care, smart cities, culture and transport, thus "deepening exchanges and cooperation between the two cities."

Ma Xiaogang stressed that the nature of cross-Strait relations and urban communication should be correctly interpreted, saying, " We have a positive and open attitude towards cross-Straits urban communication. "
