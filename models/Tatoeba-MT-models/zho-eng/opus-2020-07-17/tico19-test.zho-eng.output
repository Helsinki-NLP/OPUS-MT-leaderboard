The cumulative incidence of the new coronary virus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom increased rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020
In the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of the new coronary disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends, confirming that although different countries are at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly.
According to the Italian experience, the country, hospitals and intensive care wards need to be better prepared for the surge in the number of COVID-19 patients, especially in intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of unknown pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control reported that pathogens are a new type of coronary virus, now known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Condom 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2).
Thereafter, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named Coronary Virus Disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of the COVID-19 cases are mild, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
Of the approximately 14% of the cases, COVID-19 will progress in serious cases and will require hospitalization, while the remaining 6% will progress in critical cases and require intensive care.
The death rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared it with the Hubei Province of China.
We have also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020 with Italy.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded further, and the current dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to those of China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the magazine "European Monitor" published on March 5, 2020, Speteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO definition of cases.
In EU/EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on 24 January 2020, which were repatriated from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had detected cases of COVID-19, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported from 31 December to 15 March 2019, including that date, of which 17,750 and 1,441 deaths were reported in Italy alone.
Cumulative number and incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates every morning at 8 a.m. the number of reported COVID-19 cases in every country in the world, obtained only through official sources, such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
These data have been used to assess trends in EU/EA and UK COVID-19 and to compare them with Italy.
We calculated the 14-day contraction cumulative incidence of each EU/EA and British COVID-19 case for the period 1 January to 15 March 2020 as indicators of the incidence of active COVID-19 cases in order to consider the natural pathology of COVID-19.
We also provided the total number of reported cumulative cases per country as at 8 a.m. on March 15, 2020, and compared with data from Italy for the period 31 January to March 15, 2020.
EU/EA Trends COVID-19 in the EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom
The 14-day cumulative trend in COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom is generally consistent with the trend in Hubei Province (China) (figure 1).
For EU/EA and the United Kingdom as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February 2020 and then increased sharply around 28 February (supplementary material).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EA countries and in the United Kingdom (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020, compared with Italy.
It should be emphasized that by 8 a.m. on March 15th, the other 15 EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom had reported the same total number of cases as Italy in less than three weeks.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases reported by EU/EA and the United Kingdom is increasing rapidly.
The observed trend in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 indicates that the epidemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, national public health responses vary, cases may be defined differently from country to country, and there are differences in the programmes used to select patients who must be tested for COVID-19 diagnostic tests, including additional tests, the situation is the same.
In early March 2020, according to doctors in the affected areas of Italy, approximately 10% of the COVID-19 patients were in need of intensive care, and media reports indicated that hospitals and ICUs in those areas had reached maximum capacity.
At the EU/EA level, only 6 per cent and 1 per cent of the cases of COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care ward are currently available (data not shown).
However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner in order to supplement the current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths ...
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of intensive care and medium-term care beds available in European countries varied widely, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive care and medium-term care per 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
ECDC's sixth update of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment modeled health-care capacity and related scenarios, and estimated the incidence of cases in each EU/EA country and in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the risk of exceeding the number of beds for intensive care & gt; 90%.
Since so far cases have gathered in the EU/EA countries and in certain areas of UK, and hospitals and ICUs generally provide services for the population covered in the defined areas, it would be better to provide information on cases and ICU beds at the level of the Standard Statistical Geographical Unit 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the EU/EA and the British COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly.
Therefore, the State, hospitals and ICUs should be prepared to respond to the continuing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, particularly ICUs, as has happened in affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to slow down the dissemination of SARS-COV-2 and requires a transition from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not be understood by decision makers and hospitals sufficiently to receive and adjust response measures if it is not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity that countries have the potential to further strengthen controls to slow down SARS-CoV-2 transmission and reduce pressure on health care systems.
Otherwise, the health care system in other EU/EA countries is likely to face a proliferation of patients in need of intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The outbreak of 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronary virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths and a huge human catastrophe.
Similar to its homogeneity virus SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of people to become infected in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Although COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, it is more communicable, affecting more older persons than young people and more men than women.
In view of the rapidly increasing number of publications related to new coronary pneumonia, this paper is intended to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving research subject.
We will introduce basic knowledge of epidemiology, pathology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this synthesis will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease ...
The Spring Festival of January 25th, 2020 became an unprecedented and engraved memory for Chinese, and the outbreak of a new viral disease forced everyone to leave their homes throughout the holidays and for weeks to come.
The virus is highly homogenous with the coronary virus (COV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-COV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the related disease is known as coronary virus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly all over the country, and spread to nearly 50 other countries around the globe.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which more than 40,000 had been discharged and more than 3,000 had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 has become the number-one public enemy, and that the threat could be greater than terrorism.
According to data from PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers on virology, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment have been published in less than two months since the first reported release of the virus sequence from multiple patients on 7 January 2020.
The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the progress of research in this emerging field of disciplines.
People used to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CV-induced disease - the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss the knowledge gained so far on the prevention and prevention of the disease, as well as some pressing issues that remain to be resolved.
In the past, CoV was thought to be a non-lethal pathogen for humans, causing about 15% of the common cold.
But this century has already met two highly pathogenic humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which erupted in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries, with terrible morbidity and mortality rates.
So this COVID-19 outbreak is the third CV outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in figure 1,1 the city of Wuhan first reported several cases of undisclosed pneumonia to the National Health Council of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was published.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported his first death.
At the same time, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, medical personnel were reported infected, suggesting that there might be a human presence.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan closed down all public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study on new coronary pneumonia, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhanhua South Sea Fish Market, which was considered the starting point for an unknown animal source of infection.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a "global health emergency".
At the time of the publication of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the globe (figure 2 (Fig.2).
Due to the rapid development of the epidemic, the final scope and severity of the outbreak have yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 diagnosed COVID-19 patients) provided an updated description of the epidemic, as shown below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting all age groups, but the main age group is 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons are over 50 years of age, very few are under 20 years of age, and only 14 are under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/10 million) than women (0.27/10 million).
COVID-19 concentrated in the north of the lake and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
Average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time between morbidity and death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic regeneration (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincides with the time of large population movements before the Chinese Spring Festival.
1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) of confirmed cases and 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent) of all patients.
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (~60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large sub-family of a blanket virus with a single justice chain RNA.
They can be divided into four categories, alpha, beta, gamma and platinum, in which alpha-CoV and beta-CoV are known to be infected with humans.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are combined with their cell receptor vascular tension agent 2 (ACE2) and diphthiocytyl enzyme 4 (DPP4) and then membrane.
The virus RNA genome is released into the cytology; after its reproduction, the genome RNA forms a cyst containing the virus, together with the packaged syrup protein and the nuclear shell protein, and then integrates with the phytofilm and releases the virus.
SARS-CoV-2's first genome sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
It turns out that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV, with genetic consistency exceeding 99.98 per cent of the 10 sequenced samples taken at the first outbreak site at Wuhan South China Sea Fish Market.
SARS-COV-2 is more similar to SARS-COV in terms of genes.
By ejecting the electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in ultra thin slices of the airways.
AACE2 was found to be the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the weak combination of S proteins with human ACE2 relative to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins coded by orf3b and secret proteins coded by orf8.
SAFS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFN beta; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional structure domain or base sequence.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported on the refrigerated electron microscope (cryo-EM) structure of ACE2, with a resolution of 2.9 Å.
They found that the compound had an open and closed image, that it was assembled as a binary, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could combine two S proteins to provide evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may be a drug-screening target for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
As you know, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and spread to humans through beavers and camels, respectively.
Through SARS-CoV-2 system development comparisons with other CoVs, bats are considered to be natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus has 96% consistency with two SARS-like CoVs from bats, Bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Bat-SL-CoVZX21 respectively.
However, it is not clear what intermediate host helps the virus to infect humans across the species barrier, and the means of its transmission are yet to be clarified.
Ji et al. suggest that snakes are virus carriers from bats to humans, involving the same source reorganization within S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, consider that the piercing of a tiara, a long-kissed ant-eating animal, is a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2, given that a coV and SARS-CoV-2 found in the piercing of the titanium, is 99% genetic homogeneity.
However, the difference of 1% between the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, specific evidence is yet to provide a definitive result (Fig.33).
SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear about its physico-chemical nature.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro in dry environments for 48 hours, up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be effective in fighting the virus with ultraviolet and thermal sensitivity - 56 °C 30 minutes; Ether, 75% ethanol, chlorination, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents, but chlorine has been determined to be ineffective in killing the virus.
Humans generally lack immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies on SARS-CoV-2 immunization responses.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).
In general, the virus is first recognised by the host ' s inherently immune system through the mode of identification of the receptors (PRRs), including C-cultan sample receptors, Toll sample receptors (TLR), NOD sample receptors (NLR) and RIG-I sample receptors (RLR).
The virus is expressed through different road-to-road induction inflammation factors, tree mutagenic cell maturation and the synthesis of type I interferon (IFN), which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the ingestion of its antigens.
But, SARS-CoV's N protein can help the virus get rid of the immune response.
Adaptive immune responses will soon be added to the fight against the virus.
T lymph cells, including CD4+ and CD8+T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.
CD4+T cell irritation B cells generate virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+T cells kill infected cells.
Auxiliary T cells generate an inflammation cell factor to help these defense cells.
But CoV can suppress T cell function by leading T cell failure.
The immunisation of body fluids, including rehydrates — e.g. C3a and C5a — and antibodies, is also essential to protect against infection.
For example, the antibodies that are separated from the recovered patients can be found in MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excess response of the immune system can generate a large number of liberal bases in some parts, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst cases, multiple organ failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a concentration of sexually transmitted diseases, is more likely to affect older persons with multiple syndromes, as well as pregnant women.
Normally, individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or impaired immune functions are more likely to become infected than others.
According to a study of the earliest 425 cases in Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 has an average latency period estimated at 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study shows that according to the demographics of 8,866 cases, the lurking period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust the effective time of isolation to the most accurate latency period so as to prevent the transmission of the virus to others by people with an asymptomatic infection.
As a rule, people exposed to the virus or infected usually need to be isolated for 14 days.
Should the period of isolation be extended to 24 days?
Heating is usually the main and initial symptoms of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by any other symptoms, as well as symptoms such as cough, gas, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, abstinence, aldicarb, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had respiratory difficulties and/or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
Severers can move rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome, peptotoxic shock, metabolic acid poisoning and creciatic dysfunction.
Even in the absence of pulmonary imaging anomalies, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should undergo viral screening for early diagnosis.
A demographic study carried out in late December showed that the percentage of all symptoms was: fever 98 per cent, cough 76 per cent, respiratory difficulties 55 per cent, diarrhoea 3 per cent; 8 per cent of patients needed air support.
Two recent studies on family concentrations of sexually transmitted diseases and the insymptomatic individual transmission of diseases that lead to concentrations have reported similar results.
In contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of the MERS-CoV patients were fever (98 per cent), cough (47 per cent) and respiratory difficulties (55 per cent).
However, 80% of the patients need air support, much more than the COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with the more lethality of the MERS than the COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and abstinence (21%) were also observed among MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, fever (99% - 100%), cough (29% - 75%), breathing difficulties (40% - 42%), diarrhoea (20 - 25%) and abstinence (13 - 25%) have been shown to be the main symptoms, with about 14 - 20% of patients in need of general air support.
As of February 14, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally reached 66,576, with a mortality rate of 2 per cent.
In contrast, as of November 2002, SARS had a mortality rate of 10 per cent in 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.
An early study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was as high as 6.47, 95% confidence range (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 Comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV on symptoms, mortality and R0 are presented.
The above data show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher proliferation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than the latter.
Controlling SARS-CoV-2 is therefore more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Aggregation of sexually transmitted diseases usually occurs in the same family or from the same gathering or transportation, such as cruise ships.
Patients usually have a history of travelling or living in Wuhan or other epidemic areas, or of having close contact with infected persons or patients within the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have been discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again, thereby warning of prolonged isolation.
The number of blood cells (especially lymphocytes) is normal or reduced in the early stages of the disease.
For example, white cell count & lt; 4x109/L - including lymphocyte count & lt; 1x109/L - lymphocyte reduction, increased amino amino acid transfer enzyme levels and viral haemorrhage were found among 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
In some cases, hepatic and mussel enzymes and mythological protein levels are higher in the blood, and in most cases the blood C reacts to higher proteins and haemorrhage.
High levels of D-dimonomers and reduced lymphocytes are visible among heavy-duty patients.
Most of the COVID-19 patients are exposed to chest image abnormalities characterized by double-sided filamental shadow or pulmonary grinding glass.
Atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and fibrosis can seriously damage gas exchange.
Pulmonary perturbation disorders in type I and type II pulmonary blisters reduce the level of surfactants and increase surface tension, thereby reducing lung expansion and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
So, the worst chest imaging results usually occur at the same time as the disease's most severe.
On February 18th, 2020, the first pathological analysis by COVID-19 found pulmonary epidermal loss in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, transparent membrane formation, interterrestrial lymphocytes immersion and polynucleic cellular cells, consistent with viral infections and the pathology of ARDS, and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been used as the main criterion for diagnosing COVID-19 by reversing the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
However, since higher pseudo-negative rates may accelerate the epidemic, China began to use clinical representations for diagnosis (and no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred when SARS was diagnosed.
Therefore, in the context of medical history, clinical performance, laboratory examination and video results are essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Zhang Feng team reported on a programme to detect SARS-CoV-2, using CRRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology, which uses a test paper to detect concentrations of less than 20 x 10-18 vol/L to 200 x 10-18 vol/L (10-100 copies of viruses per litre) without complex instruments.
If proven in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of diagnosis.
Due to the lack of experience in treating new types of CoVs, doctors mainly provide support treatment to COVID-19 patients, while attempting to use or propose treatments for other CoVs, such as SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs, and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These include current and potential treatments such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It's even suggested that the blood of a recovering patient be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially mainly attacked the lungs and could also express other ACE2 organs, such as gastrointestinal systems and kidneys, at a lower level.
Nevertheless, respiratory disorders and failure are a major threat to patients and a leading cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore essential to alleviating symptoms and saving lives, including conventional oxygen, high flow oxygen, non-constructive and mechanical gas, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms must be supported by the In vitro Oxygen (ECMO), an improved cardio-pulmonary by-passive technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and sepsis shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
As we all know, excessive immune response by SARS and MERS patients can lead to cell factor storms.
Cell-based storms are a form of reaction to systemic inflammation and are characterized by releases of a range of cell-based factors, including TNF alpha, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFN beta, IFN gamma and MCP-1.
These cell factors can induce immune cells to release a lot of free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunization inhibition is essential in the treatment of cytokinesis storms, especially among patients with severe illnesses.
The cortex steroids and toads, an IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytological storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytogenesis storms include: regulation of T-cell-directed immune responses; interdiction of IFN-Gamma, IL-1 and TNF; suppression of JAK; Bona ' abstinence; cell factor signal transfer inhibitors; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants to treat SARS to reduce the severity of the damage caused by the disease.
But a large dose of steroids is not useful for severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they may have serious side effects, especially ambulatory fractures, which seriously affect prognosis.
Nevertheless, it is recommended that the CIVD-19 patients be treated with caution for short periods using low- and medium-dose cortex steroids.
At the time of writing, the existence of effective ART has not yet been confirmed.
However, it has been found that Radeshwey, a nucleotide-like drug, has worked for a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Redeswell was a new antiviral drug developed by Gillid, initially used to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg.
Later, it was also proved that Redeswell might suppress other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gillid has provided the drug to China for two clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons, the results of which are expected.
In addition, it has been proposed to use Barcrackerini, alpha-combustine, Lopinave/Litonave and Libavelin as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects may occur following joint treatment in Lopinawa/Litonave.
The interaction between these treatment methods and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Pulse and antibody formation for recovered patients
The collection of blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease or for the protection of healthy individuals from the disease has a long history ...
In fact, recovering patients usually contain relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood...
Antigens are an immunoglobin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes against pathogens and other things that can identify unique molecules in pathogens and directly middle them.
Based on this principle, the blood of a group of recovered Covid-19 patients was taken and injected to 10 people in critical condition.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads and increased saturation.
However, prior to the development of special treatments, there is a need for validation and clarification in order to suggest methods that can be used on a large scale.
In addition, some of the shortcomings associated with the plasma should be carefully considered in the light of the effects of the treatment.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cell factors to release syndrome, a toxic reaction that may endanger life.
Antibody concentrations in blood are generally low and blood demand for treatment of patients at risk is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce special antibodies fast enough to confront a global epidemic.
Therefore, the more critical and practical methods are: separation of B cells from recovered patients and identification of the genetic code for encoded effective antibodies, or screening of effective antibodies for proteins necessary for the virus.
In this way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
In China, it's been thousands of years since TCM was used to treat many diseases.
However, the efficacy of the treatment depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple components in the prescription, which varies according to the diagnosis of the disease based on the TCM theory.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their optimal combination.
At present, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from a severe phase, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, it has been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19 with wind-detoxification capsules and pseudo-spray capsules.
In several provinces of China, 87 per cent of patients use TCM treatment, with the highest cure rates observed for COVID-19 patients, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ningxia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hubei province only about 30 per cent of COVID-19 patients use TCM treatment, with the lowest cure rates (13 per cent).
However, this is only a rough comparison, since many other factors of influence, such as the number and severity of patients, should also be included in the assessment.
On February 18th, 2020, Chamberlain and his colleagues published a study on the comparative western drug (WM) for treatment separately from WM and TCM.
They found that WM+TCM group temperature recovery, dissipation of symptoms and length of hospitalization were significantly shorter than the WM group.
Most impressive of all, the NM+TCM group has a significantly lower symptomatic deterioration rate (from light to heavy) than the NM group (7.4 per cent versus 46.2 per cent) and the NM+TCM group also has a lower mortality rate than the NM group (8.8 per cent versus 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM still require a higher quality control test, a wider range and more centres to confirm.
The identification of TCM treatments or their combinations as a mechanism for their functioning and, where possible, the clarification of their active components will also be a cause for concern.
Most of the patients suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 are extremely frightened by this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and the isolated are upset, alone and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, oxygen deficiency and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects, such as sleeplessness caused by cortisol steroids, may increase anxiety and psychological distress.
During the early stages of SARS, a series of psychological reactions were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psycho-optimism, psychiatric symptoms, paranoia and even suicide.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracking and isolation increases anxiety and guilt over the effects of infection, isolation and stigma on their families and friends ...
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, with clear communication through regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the transmission chain from animal host and infected to vulnerable host, and are often used as a supplement to antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Industry has made efforts to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and effective intermediate and antibody and/or protective immunization against SARS-CoV.
The detoxification vaccine has been evaluated in SARS animal models.
However, prior to the initiation of clinical research, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in old age and lethal assault models and their protection against co-human and animal infections had not yet been determined.
It's probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, the persistence of co-human and animal diseases in the epidemic zone has led to the persistence of sporadic cases and concentrated infections in the Middle East region and their spread to other regions.
Through the use of live viruses, DNA particles, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral sample particles and recombinant proteins, vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine for non-immun individuals against SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this difficulty due to the long time required for vaccine development (average of 18 months) and the dynamics of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to present its entire clinical process among thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover gradually, without any consequences.
But, like SARS and MERS, CIVD-19 patients have high morbidity and mortality rates.
Therefore, the establishment of a prognosis model for this disease is essential for health-care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources ...
According to clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect the prognosis or subsequent relevance of the COVID-19 patient (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor influencing SARS prognosis, as is COVID-19.
As mentioned earlier, in a study that included 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7 per cent were over 50 years of age.
Patients in need of intensive care are more likely to have basic collusive conditions and complications and to be significantly older than patients in need of intensive care (medium age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognosis in the outcome of the COVID-19 patient.
Gender: As mentioned earlier, more men than women are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/10 million vs. 0.27/10).
Combining and complications: Covid-19 patients in intensive care are more likely to suffer acute heart damage and heart disorder.
Heart attack is also the leading cause of SARS deaths.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be associated with ACE2 positive choreology cells, which could lead to liver abnormalities in the COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age is closely related to underlying diseases and may affect each other.
Laboratory results were abnormal: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in blood reflect the severity of the inflammation or tissue damage and have been considered a disease, a therapeutic response and potential prognosis for eventual recovery.
It was also suggested that the level of CRPs was relevant to the severity of COVID-19 and its prognosis.
In addition, the rise in emulsion dehydrases (LDH), amino amino amino acid transfer enzymes (AST), amino amino transfer enzymes (ALT) and cK (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So they're traditional signs of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: The timing of breast imaging and clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues to predict the fate and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As previously mentioned, steroids are immunosuppressants, usually used as an ancillary treatment for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of the damage caused by inflammation.
As a result of the widespread use of large doses of cortex steroids for heavy SARS patients, many survivors suffer from haemorrhage, leading to permanent disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used at small doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients were under great stress because they were often subjected to prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of relatives and friends.
Psychological counselling and long-term support are needed to help these patients to get out of stress and return to normal life ...
According to demographic studies to date, the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 appears to be different from SARS.
In addition to reproduction in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or symptoms in the early stages of the infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
As a result, infected persons generate a large number of viruses in the course of their day-to-day activities in the early or latent stages of the onset of the disease, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is considered to occur when the patient is seriously ill, and most of it does not occur at an early stage.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than SARS.
China is currently making tremendous efforts, including the blockade of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued isolation of almost all its population, with a view to disrupting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have already caused serious economic and other damage in China, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the epidemic is slowing down ...
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and that the drop phase will continue for three to four months.
However, some other experts are less optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimate that COVID-19 is much more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have developed models for predicting the effects of the epidemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world ' s population.
A Canadian team reported that two weeks ago, patients who recovered and discharged from hospital detected SARS-CoV-2 in their midnail and swabs, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to the influenza.
However, as the number of new cases has decreased, there are encouraging signs in China that the current strategy may have worked.
The Ebola virus was predicted to cause 1 million cases and half a million deaths.
But, through strict isolation, the disease is finally under control.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become less contagious and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with the human body.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and possibly even through direct contact with virus-contaminated objects.
The virus is also found in the excreta, which increases the likelihood of its transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases, 41 per cent of which may have been caused by in-patient infections, included 17 patients who had previously suffered from other diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Therefore, more intensive preventive measures should be taken to protect the population, especially health-care workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have had contact with the patient or the infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 dust masks (in the 1860s series) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgery masks prevent droplets from potential infections from spreading in the air or sticking to the surface of objects that may be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (1860s series) masks can prevent the inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viruses can fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, which is about 85 nm.
Since viral particles can penetrate even five folded surgical masks, medical personnel in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to the mask, medical personnel should wear isolation suits to further reduce their exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 with a N95 mask; the virus could have entered it through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical personnel should wear transparent masks or goggles when facing patients.
For the general public in areas affected by or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that all people wash their hands with disinfective soap more frequently than usual, remain as isolated as possible indoors and limit contact with potential infections ...
Three feet is considered the right distance for people to stay away from patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak, its high level of homogeneity with SARS-COV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused China ' s heightened alarm.
However, until January 19, 2020, the Director of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Wuhan City was still appeased, saying that the new virus was not very contagious, had limited human reach, and that the epidemic was preventable.
The news clearly eased the public's guard, and the upcoming Spring Festival was missed as the key node to contain the epidemic in Wuhan.
China ' s disease control agencies may learn this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future ...
For example, these bodies should (1) be more cautious in issuing announcements, since each word is essential to citizens to change their attitudes and decision-making; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) control potential outbreaks more strictly at an early stage than attempt to appease the public; and (4) conduct more frequent targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic and regularly test and improve social response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 started at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the globe.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-COV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 looks like SARS recurrence.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects more older persons than young people, more men than women, and has higher levels of severity and mortality among older patients than younger patients.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
Even without symptoms, COVID-19 patients transmit the virus, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when the condition is serious, which makes it much more difficult to control COVID-19 transmission than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, the regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.
On the other hand, a cured patient could turn to the sun again.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of transmission of the virus.
Given the rapidness of the research on COVID-19, the following key issues remain to be resolved:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homogeneity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the two bats SARS CoV, we still can't come to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What kind of animal transmits the virus from the original host — assuming bats — to the human host?
If we don't know the answers to questions 1 and 2, we can't effectively cut the transmission route and the outbreak can happen again at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical analyses have proved that SARS-CoV-2 is combined with ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the aerodynamic cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also combine cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in the process of human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic? Will it disappear like SARS? Or will it recur like a flu?
Finding answers to the above and to many other questions is essential, but it may take longer.
However, regardless of the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic and return our lives to normal as soon as possible.
The genesis of the human and animal coronary disease of the human coronary virus.
For thousands of years, mutagenicity and adaptive power have driven the coronal evolution of the coronal virus (Coronavirus, CoV) and its host (including humans).
Before 2003, two human coronary viruses (HCOVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as common colds.
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) reversed the situation and revealed the destructive and deadly nature of HCOV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of the year again made CoV the focus of attention and, surprisingly, it was more contagious than its sister, SARS-CoV, but less pathogenic.
HCOV infection is a common disease, so knowing the origins of HCOV co-morbidity will help us.
Most HCOVs come from bats and are non-pathogenic.
Some of the HCOV intermediate storage hosts are also known.
The identification of animal hosts is directly relevant to the prevention of human diseases.
The study of coV host interactions in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of coV morbidity.
In this overview, we outlined the existing knowledge of seven HCOVs, highlighting their discovery history, the origins of co-human and animal diseases and inter-species transmission.
What's important is that we compare and compare different HCOVs from the point of view of the evolution of the virus and the reconstitution of the genome.
In this context, we have explored the current outbreak of the 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, it focuses on the requirements for successful host conversion and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease.
CoV is in the coronary virus section, made up of a group of justice single-chain RNA viruses with a film.
These viruses have the largest genome of the RNA virus, with 2.6 to 32,000 bases, known as coronary viruses because of their coronary form under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoV has a non-particular genome of a shared similar organization.
About two thirds of the genomes contain two large overlapping open-reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp. 1a and pp. 1ab copy enzymes polypolyte.
These polymeric proteins are further processed, producing 16 unstructured proteins called nsp1-16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including punctures (S), film (E), membrane (M) and nuclear proteins (N).
Many spectrum-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by CV from different spectrum systems.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four rows (α-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and platinum-CoV), in which beta-CoV consists of most HCOVs and is broken down into four spectra (A, B, C and D).
Systematic developmental evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main hosts of gamma-CoV and titanium-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has been crossing species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.
So far, seven human-infected coronary viruses (HCOVs) have been known.
Among them, HcoV-229E and HcoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
5 other β-CoVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Crown Virus (SARS-COV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Crown Virus (MERS-COV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 generally cause mild symptoms such as common colds and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV-2 and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, leading to severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively larger number of patients, and are more likely to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (Accute Respiratory Dispress Syndrome, ARDS) and lung exterior manifestations.
In the mid-60s, the first HCOV-229E virus strain B814 was separated from the nasal secretion of common cold patients.
Since then, humans have accumulated more relevant knowledge through extensive research into two HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses that can cause self-restrictive symptoms.
In fact, before the SARS outbreak, the notion that HCOV was usually harmless was widely accepted.
SARS, which broke out in 2003, is one of the most devastating events in the history of the world, with more than 8,000 people infected and a crude death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to other parts of the world.
2019 The new HCOV virus (2019-nCoV, renamed SARS-CoV-2) is a pathogen of the persistent 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), which, as at 3 March 2020, had taken over 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm has been sounded and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCOVs have a cogeneration of human and animal disease from bats, rats or domestic animals.
There is a variety of evidence that all HCOV evolution originates in bats, where the virus is well adapted and non-pathogenic, but displays great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has brought enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracking HCOV's human and animal pathologies provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and constraints of the virus species leaping.
In addition, it will guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 storage hosts, intermediate hosts and extended animal hosts, which will be important in preventing future virus spills.
In this overview, we provide an overview of the origins of HCOV co-infection, inter-septic transmission and morbidity mechanisms.
In particular, we have highlighted and explored a common theme, namely that HCOV parent viruses are usually not pathogenic in their natural hosts, but pathogenic after cross-species transmission to new hosts.
In addition, we have reviewed the trend of HCOV evolution, in which the increase in transportability is often accompanied by a reduction in pathogenicity.
In this context, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
Since the late 1930s, the animal CoV has been well known.
Prior to the first separation of HCOV-229E strains from the nasal secretion of common cold patients, B814, medical practitioners had separated different affected animals (including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs) from Cov.
In the last few decades, seven species of HCOV have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCOV discovery in chronological order (table 1) would provide us with a wealth of information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCOV-229E strain was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infections and subsequently adapted to growth in the WI-38 lung strain.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E have headaches, sneezes, discomfort, larynx, common cold symptoms, 10-20% fever, cough, etc.
In the second half of 1967, HcoV-OC43 was separated from organ development in the mammoth brain and subsequent successive generations.
The clinical characteristics of HCOV-OC43 infection are similar to HCOV-229E and there is no significant difference in symptoms as compared to other respiratory pathogen infections (e.g. influenza A virus and nasal virus).
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed globally, mainly in the temperate climate during winter.
Usually, these two viruses have less than a week of incubation, and then they have about two weeks.
A human volunteer study shows that healthy individuals infected with HCOV-229E have a mild common cold.
Only a few patients with low immune function show severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as Atypical Pneumonia, is the first fully documented pandemic in human history caused by HCOV, the pathogen of which is SARS-CoV, the third detected HCOV.
The first example is SARS, dating back to Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002.
SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases, 774 deaths and spread to many countries and continents.
In addition to the super-transmitters, it is estimated that each case may result in approximately 2 secondary cases, with a lurking period of 4-7 days and a peak in viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
The patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed muscle pains, headaches, fever, discomfort and cold fighting, followed by respiratory difficulties, late symptoms of coughing and respiratory distress.
lymphocytes are reduced, liver function abnormalities and mycetic stimulant enzymes are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
In addition, widespread lung damage was observed among SARS patients, with an increase in upper-skin cell growth and hyperplastic cells.
Then about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical air conditioning.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, the liver and kidneys, are likely to be infected, usually accompanied by a cytological storm, which may be fatal in cases with low immune function.
The virus was first separated from an open pulmonary check-up of a relative from the origin of the patient who went from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been working on HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 separated at the end of 2004 from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent among young children, the elderly and those with impaired immunity from respiratory diseases.
Among the diseases caused by HCOV-NL63, nostrils, conjunctitis, fever and bronchitis are common.
Another independent study shows that the same virus was separated from the nasal specimens of an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was found in the Netherlands, it is in fact distributed around the world.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 is about 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 has something to do with obstructing larynx (also known as Grub larynx).
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong due to pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to community access to pulmonary and bronchitis, there are reports that HCOV-HKU1 is associated with acute asthma.
Similar to HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 has been found worldwide to cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four communities have been well adapted to humans and are often unlikely to undergo mutation leading to high pathogenic diseases, but there are also accidents and unknown causes, such as a more toxic and rare subtype of HCOV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Usually, these HCOVs are less toxic or pathogenic when they acquire the ability to effectively transmit and sustain in humans.
MERS-CoV was first separated from the lungs of a 60-year-old acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although the majority of laboratory confirmed cases are from the Middle East, imported cases have been reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional subsequent transmissions to persons in close contact.
In 2015, secondary transmission erupted again in Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical performance of MERS is similar to SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, acute renal failure has also occurred in many MERS patients, a characteristic unique to MERS in HCOV-induced diseases to date.
More than 30% of patients have stomach tract symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases had been reported, with a high rate of 34.4 per cent of deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to mankind.
In mid-December 2019, condensed pneumonia was found in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and a retrospective analysis confirmed its association with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization declared the continued outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 an international public health emergency of concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases had been diagnosed globally, with a crude death rate of 3.4 per cent.
It is worth noting that the rate of deaths in Hubei, China, is 4.2 per cent, while the rate of deaths outside of Hubei is 1.2 per cent.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe respiratory infections in the form of heat, cough and respiratory difficulties.
Some patients are also suffering from diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% high nucleotide sequence homogeneity, they are clustered into different branches in system growth trees.
Compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic, but more contagious.
The reported presence of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections may accelerate the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCOVs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First of all, HCOV disease has a very similar lurking and pathological duration.
At this point, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend of the other six HCOVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-COV and four communities acquiring HCOV (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections exhibit more common features in community access to HCOV infections, including non-specific, mild and even symptomatic manifestations.
On the other hand, a small proportion of the serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-COV infections, although in a slightly lower proportion.
Third, the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of community access to HCOV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 has at least as high as community access HCOV.
On the other hand, whether SARS-CoV-2's transportability, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, will decline after human descent is still to be verified.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in excreta samples.
At least in some cases, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 has played an important role as in SARS-CoV remains to be clarified in future studies.
Also, it's important to see whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal like community access HCOV.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenicity and continuous transmission through the generations will have an important impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All four species of community access to HCOV that cause mild symptoms are well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, humans are well adapted to these four types of HCOV.
In other words, both sides could be survivors of the ancient HCOV pandemic.
HcoV, which causes serious human illness, and people with serious HcoV disease have died.
For this reason, HCOV must replicate enough in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations against host limitation factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the more infected it is, the more likely it is that it will be fully adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, its spread in humans will be difficult to stop through isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, these four communities have been able to spread the coronary virus among the population, resulting in a common cold for those with normal immune functions.
These viruses don't need animal hosts.
By contrast, the high pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to humans and cannot continue to spread among them.
They need to survive and reproduce among their common patients and may seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets through one or more intermediate and expanded host communities.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 communities with access to HCOV.
It's as contagious as community access HCOV, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community access to HCOV and less pathogenic than SARS-COV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and circulates within humans without host or intermediate host.
Before discussing the origins of HCOV animals, the evolution of HCOV hosts, natural hosts, storage hosts, intermediate hosts and extended host definitions and characteristics will guide us.
If an animal has a closely related ancestor at a high nucleic acid sequence level, it will be an evolutionary host to HCOV.
Ancestry viruses are usually adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, storage hosts carry HCOV on a permanent basis.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and the natural host of HCOV or its progeny.
By contrast, if HCOV had just been placed in the middle host shortly after or immediately after, it would not be well adapted to the new host and would normally be pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as a source of human-infected animal disease and can serve to magnify the host by allowing the virus to be reproduced briefly and then spread to humans in order to increase the scale of the human infection.
If HCOV cannot sustain its transmission in the middle host, there may be an end-of-life infection.
On the contrary, HcoV can adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term locality.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural repository.
Epidemiological data retrospective analysis shows that SARS indexed cases have had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seropositive surveys show higher levels of immunoglobin (IgG) resistance to SARS-CoV in animal vendors compared to the general population.
In the living animal market, the beaver and a beaver were first found carrying the almost identical SARS-CoV virus.
The fact that there are no further SARS reports after all the beavers in the market have been removed indirectly supports this view.
However, reports suggest that the detection of SARS-CoV by farm beavers who are wild or not exposed to the living animal market is largely negative, suggesting that the beavers may simply magnify the host in the middle rather than the natural host of SARS-COV.
It is worth noting that because 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-COV antibodies, it cannot be excluded that a variety of small mammals may also be able to expand hostships among SARS-COVs.
All these animals seem to be the terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
A subsequent study of the SARS-CoV natural animal host found a closely related bat coronary virus, known as SARS-related daisy coronary virus HKU3 (SARRSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which survived in the middle daisy.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequences.
The virus and other bat coronary viruses have 88-92% nucleic acid sequence homogeneity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept of bats as hosts of emerging human pathogens.
In addition, researchers have identified multiple SARS coronary viruses (SL-CoVs) from bats, but no virus can be separated as a living virus except for one designated WIV1.
Human vascular tension agent 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
Experimental evidence suggests that the WIV1 extracted from the bat dung sample uses bats, beavers and human ace2 as a receptor to enter cells.
Interestingly, SARS' sermons of patients during recovery can be medium-sized with WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestor to bat SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleotide sequence homogeneity.
Despite the high homogeneity of the two viruses, it is generally assumed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus for SARS-COV, nor is bats a direct repository for SARS-COV.
System development analysis puts MERS-CoV in the same group as bats CoV-HKU4 and bats CoV-HKU5.
Bats CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor diptosterase 4 (DPP4) to infiltrate the virus.
MERS-CoV RNA dependent RNA polymerase sequences are more closely associated in system development with the corresponding RNA in bat beta-CoV from Europe and Africa.
To date, no living MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV has only 87% nucleic acid sequence homogeneity with its close relative bat CoV-HKU25.
Therefore, bats may not be directly stored by MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that single-peak camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV and antibodies, just as many African camels originate in the Middle East.
The live MERS-CoV that separates from the noses of single-peak camels is the same virus as the one found in the human body, which further suggests that the camels are the true repositories of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that in the camels with experimental infection MERS-CoV, the symptoms are generally slight, but a large number of viruses are observed to fall.
It is worth noting that infected camels transmit the virus not only through their respiratory tract, but also through their faeces, which are also the main route through which bats transmit the virus.
Problems remain, however, as many of the MERS confirmed cases have no history of contact with camels prior to symptoms, which may be attributable to human or unknown modes of transmission, including unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 and separated bats from the mid-althroids CoV RatG13 have 96.2% nucleotide homogeneity.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are too large to determine filiation.
In other words, unless almost the same bat coronary virus is discovered in the future, bats may not be the direct repository of SARS-CoV-2.
It is assumed that the middle animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should have been associated with many of the first COVID-19 cases of wildlife species sold and slaughtered at the South China Sea Wholesale Market, suggesting possible animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on macrogenomic sequencing suggest that a small, endangered mammal, known as a mammal, may also carry an ancestor associated with SARS-CoV-2 β-CoV.
These new mountain-piercing coronary virus genomes have 85-92% nucleic acid sequence homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2.
But they're also very close to RatG13, about 90% homogeneity at nucleic acid sequence levels.
In system growth trees, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 strains, one of which has a more similar receptor combination (RBD) with 97.4% amino acid sequence homogeneity.
In contrast, RSS-CoV-2 and RTT13 differ even more, although the sequences of the two genomes are more homogenous.
An earlier study of disease through nails also reported the detection of virus overlaps from lung samples, with similar results for SARS-CoV-2.
The study, using different assembly methods and manual processing, obtained some of the genome sequences of about 86.3% of the entire genome of the virus.
We can't rule out the possibility that we're one of SARS-CoV-2 middle animal hosts.
However, there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-COV-2 is a direct result of the practice.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-2 associated with the piercing of nails SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 has yet to determine the evolutionary path in bats, through nails and other mammals.
Although the highest sequence homogeneity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the cross-mountard RBD, SARS-CoV-2 associated beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 had the highest whole genome sequence homologue.
It can be highly assumed that the high similarities between the beta-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD associated with the submarine SARS-COV-2 are due to the convergence of the selective interface.
The other opposite view is that the beta-CoV and RatG13 reorganisation of the third species of wild animals is related to the submarine SARS-CoV-2.
As a driving force of evolution, reorganization is widespread in beta-CoV.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 direct human and animal disease is not yet known.
In addition to high pathogenic HCOV, researchers studied the origins of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1.
Systematic developmental evidence suggests that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E may have originated from bat coronary viruses, while the progeny of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 have also been found in rodents.
According to the report, the bat coronary virus known as ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in three-colour bats in North America is closely related to HCOV-NL63.
HCOV-229E, on the other hand, has a genetic connection to another bat-caw virus found in Ghana (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008), in which camels are suspected to be host.
For the sake of clarity, figures 1 and 2 summarize existing knowledge of known animal origins of HCOV.
System development analysis provides evidence of historical inter-species transmission of HCOV.
Around 1890, when HCOV-OC43 infected humans from cross-species livestock, there was an epidemic of respiratory infections.
The history of inter-cropping HCOV-229E is unclear.
Bat alpha-CoV, which is closely related to HcoV-229E, has been discovered.
There was a camel between the two, alpha-CoV.
There's a lot of evidence to support the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not camels, may contact bats in a common ecological position.
On the contrary, humans are in close contact with camels.
Secondly, the bats associated with HCOV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the camels cause respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, no camels were found in wildlife, alpha-CoV.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that camels get HCOV-229E-related alpha-coVs from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipa and Hendra.
It's not surprising, therefore, that bats transmit HCOV-229E directly to humans.
Or, even though bat alpha-CoV serves as a gene bank for HcoV-229E, the camels and monocrusts may be the middle hosts that transmit the virus to humans, exactly the same as the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is a good illustration of the spread from bats to single-peak camels and from single-peak camels to human species.
The origins of the evolution of the bat's MERS-CoV were known in their initial identification and later discovered reinforced this argument.
Obviously, bats provide a rich reservoir of virus species for inter-species exchange and inter-species transmission.
Long-lived and dense groups, close social interaction and strong flying power are the advantages of bats becoming the ideal "virarians."
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been inside a single-peak camel for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and the camels have been transformed from intermediate hosts into stable natural depositors.
MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintains a relatively low mutation rate.
Its sporadic spread to humans was an accident, and because it was not sustainable, humans were still the final host of the MERS-CoV.
The role (if any) of cross-carriage in SARS-COV-2 transmission is different from that of camels in MERS-COV transmission.
In particular, the bazooka-CoV is highly pathogenic in the bazooka.
They may be the terminal host of the SARS-CoV-2 associated beta-CoV, similar to the beavers in SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 inter-species transmission from animals to humans must be identified or excluded.
First of all, bats may be the hosts of the SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share ecological positions with bats through slaughtering or coal mining.
Second of all, it might be one of the hosts of SARS-CoV-2's new invasion of the virus.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and eating wild food.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to infection.
There's a need for an antibody survey of livestock and wildlife.
Thirdly, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 may be restructured and adapted in the third species that have been exposed to bats and cross-marine.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is continuing.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, the three main factors of the virus have also played an important role in facilitating the crossing of the interfamilial barrier by the coronary virus.
First of all, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the mutation rate of the coronary virus is estimated to be "medium" to "high", with an average replacement rate of about 10 to 4 times per year per site, depending on the stage of adaptation of the coronary virus to the new host.
The elimination of coronary viruses, which have proof-readable nucleotide extratex enzymes can lead to very high variability and decay, or even non-survival.
Interestingly, it is known that remdesivir, a nuclear analogue, can suppress coronary virus replication by suppressing this nucleotide extratex enzymes and RNA dependent RNA polymerases.
Redeswell is one of the most promising anti-Sars-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of the coronary virus is about 1 million times higher than that of its host.
Also, if the coronary virus is not well adapted to the host, the mutation rate is usually high.
The SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is significantly lower than that of SARS-COV, which shows that it is more adaptive to humans.
It's assumed that it's adapted to another host that's close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-peak camels.
Theoretically, genetic drift is unlikely to lead to the rapid neutralization of vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger RNA genome of the coronary virus has added plasticity to the modifier of mutation and reorganisation of genes, thus increasing the potential for inter-synthetic evolution, which facilitates the emergence of new coronary viruses when appropriate.
This is evidenced by a large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions that are coded to the end of the genome's 3' end.
Third, the coronary virus changes the template randomly and frequently through a unique "copy selection" mechanism during RNA replication.
In the host of a hybrid container, chain exchanges occur frequently during the CoV RNA transfer process.
High homogeneity of the whole and subgene of RNA can reorganise the creation of a new coronary virus.
Systematic evidence of natural restructuring was found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coronary viruses such as bats SL-COV and bats CoV-HKU9.
Transmission-related virus-host interactions
In addition to the above three viral factors, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
A typical example is the reorganization of SARS-CoV, which shows evidence of positive selection in inter-septic transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of separate strains of humans and beavers SARS-COV, researchers believe that SARS-COV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially through mutations in S-protein RBD.
Normally, the RBD in the coronary virus S protein interacts with the cell receptor and is closely screened by the host's antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in S1 Sessions 318 to 510 amino acids, which binds people ACE2 and its coreceptors to allow the virus to enter.
RSS-CoV's RBD can identify the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, beavers, rats and beavers, so that the virus spreads among the species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues of separate strains of human and beaver viruses were observed in RBD, 4 of which were located in the receptor base of interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The presence of K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of the fruit beaver SARS-CoV may increase the affinity of fibrous protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be vital to the adaptation of the virus to humans.
Notably, SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 module is 30%, which means that its S-protein-to-person AACE2 bond may have changed.
Indeed, a cryoscope study shows that the affinity of this combination is 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV S.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors are needed in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HcoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCOV receptors, such as HCOV-229E ' s aminosterase N and HCOV-OC43 ' s 9-O-Acetylated saliva.
They may also explain why these coronary viruses have successfully adapted to humans after spreading across animal hosts.
In addition to the cell receptor, the results of HCOV inter-species transmission are influenced by other host dependency and restrictive factors.
The difference between these host proteins in humans and natural hosts, such as bats, single-peak camels and rodents, may constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
HCOV successfully spreads by depriving host dependency and breaking host constraints.
In this regard, the molecular determinants of the important field of viral-host interaction have yet to be identified and presented ...
An unbiased whole genome screening of SARS-CoV-2 hosts using the latest CRISPR technology may be successful.
The emergence of a new HCOV: Back to the original
The diversity of bat coronary viruses provides ample opportunity for the emergence of a new HCOV.
In this sense, Batcaw virus serves as a gene bank for HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic reorganization are also drivers of HCOV evolution and two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coded genes may completely alter the form of the virus.
In SARS-CoV-assisted proteins, because of the separation of SARS-CoV-related bat viruses, they were found to code different ORF8 proteins and therefore thought that ORF8 was important for adapting to humans.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide missing features of SARS-CoV were found in isolated strains.
This loss divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to be an adaptive mutation to facilitate host conversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have been reorganized with the alpha- and gamma-coV spectrum, where a large number of smaller reorganization areas were found in RNA dependent RNA polymerases.
In nsp9, most nsp10 and part of nsp14 also found the place of reorganization.
Similarly, studies have shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has undergone inter-spectral reorganizations, which have occurred in single-peak camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reorganizations were observed in other HCOVs, where HCOV and other animal coronary viruses were reorganized in their non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that manual selection may result in accidental changes in the virus genome, which may be due to a reduction in the pressure of choice, such as the host immune system to which the virus is exposed.
An example of these effects is the absence of dual nucleotide in the HCOV-229E prototype strain, which leads to the loss of the entire length of ORF4.
Although a complete ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCOV-229E, the camel alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide inserted, causing a mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCOV is also driven by the pressure of the storage host ' s selection.
After bats were infected with the coronary virus, no symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected, suggesting that coronary viruses and bats were adapted to each other.
From anatomy and physiology, bats seem to be well adapted to coronary viruses.
For example, the failure of the bat-inflammation response has effectively reduced pathological changes caused by coronary viruses.
In addition, the natural anti-cell activity of bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the inhibitive natural anti-cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the main tissue compatibility complex I molecules.
Moreover, the high-level active oxygen (ROS) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats can both inhibit the copying of the coronary virus and affect the calibration through the nucleic acid outer cut-off enzyme, thus providing selective pressure on the strain to become highly pathogenic when entering the new host.
More pathogenic coronary strains may also evolve through reorganization, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features to suit the host.
So it's not by chance that three new HCOVs have emerged in the last two decades.
The coronary virus does not cause illness or mild symptoms among the stored hosts, such as bats and camels.
They do a lot of reproduction, and they don't cause a strong host immunization response.
That's why there's an asymptomatic carrier and a serious human infection.
Severe symptoms are due mainly to the excess activation of the immune response and the cell factor storm, so the more immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of an insymptomatic carrier, the immune response has been decoupled from the coronary reproduction.
The same strategy to de-link the immune response may have a positive effect in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The jammers in the bats are particularly intense.
Therefore, at least in the early stages of the human SARS-CoV-2 infection, the use of I-compressors should be beneficial.
In addition, the NLRP3 in bats has a faulty activation.
Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 to suppress NLRP3 inflammation may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were generated.
Although it has been found that bats with 95% nucleotide homogeneity with SARS-CoV are beta-coV, there is also a bat coronary virus with 96% nucleotide homologue with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that the beavers and other animals in the market carry the same virus as SARS-COV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-COV-2 has not yet been identified.
It has been discovered that punctuated through nails and beta-coVs, apparently of the same origin as SARS-CoV-2, suggests that punctuating through nails may be one of the middle hosts, or punctuating through pedagogic bazooka-coVs may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally manufactured.
With the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the coronary virus has returned to the spotlight.
Research on coronary viruses in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the origin of HCOV diseases and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.
There is ample evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from exposure between humans and beavers on the market, closing the wet market and killing the beavers can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same token, given the discovery of several spectrometers that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, the punctuation of bazooka-CoV should be removed from the wet market in order to prevent co-morbidity.
However, further research is still to be done on whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through mountain-piercing and other mammals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed for a long time in a single-peak camel.
These camels are important vehicles and are the main source of local meat, milk, leather and fur products.
They are spread across the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, following the Chinese wildlife market approach to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In order to stop the recurrence of the MERs, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, a new gene type may emerge, causing an outbreak.
The coronary disease of humans and animals circulates in the wild environment.
In particular, there is a high diversity of bat coronary diseases.
These animals have many opportunities for evolution and reorganization, leading to new coronary viruses that are more easily transmitted and/or deadly in humans in the future.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wildlife should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals ...
After the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop better prevention and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have been on Earth for a long time.
They stay in their natural hosts until there's a chance of spilling over.
Although bats have many characteristics conducive to the spread of the virus, if people are educated to stay away from bats and other wildlife species, human exposure to bats and other wildlife species will be greatly reduced.
In order to better understand the ecological state of the coronary virus and its natural host, continuous monitoring of mammals will be necessary and will prove very useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.
In short, the most effective way to prevent viral human and animal disease is to keep humans away from the natural habitat of the natural host of the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 still has a few missing points in the mystery of the origin of the co-morbidity.
First of all, if bats transmit an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus through the nails, it makes sense to look at the circumstances under which bats and nails can share the same ecological position.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how human contact with bats is yet to be determined.
Third, if a third mammal is a true intermediate host, it must be made clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and mountain piercings.
Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, are likely to be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be carried out.
In the case of bats, nails or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical intergenerational viruses are expected to be found in natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will reveal the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
Need to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in COVID-19.
On February 6, 2020, our team released "A Guide to Rapid Advice for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infections of the 2019 New Coronal Virus (2019-nCoV), through which we provided experience and lessons for the global response to the epidemic.
However, 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, and based on ongoing research and clinical practice, our knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are constantly being updated.
In the present letter, we have responded to one of the comments on the above-mentioned guidelines and have provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest "COVID-19 Clinical Program" issued by the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China (seventh edition).
In December 2019, 2019 new coronary virus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which has now been officially named 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 coronary virus (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid recommendation guide, which was published online in the magazine Military Medical Research on February 2020.
Since its launch, it has attracted a wide range of attention.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease and, based on ongoing research and clinical practice, our knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) published seven versions of the "COVID-19 Clinical Program" between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have changed substantially.
Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou and others, who, based on their clinical experience, have come up with a simple score.
Their work provides new evidence for our guidance and valuable references to the global pandemic.
We acknowledge their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their proposals also need to be updated in line with the latest "COVID-19 Clinical Program" and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), a suspected case diagnosis requires a combination of an epidemiological history feature and two clinical manifestations for a comprehensive analysis and, in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, three clinical manifestations are to be met:
Epidemiological history: (1) traveled or lived in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas or in communities where there are reported cases of COVID-19 within 14 days prior to the onset of the symptoms; (2) had a history of contact with SARS-COV-2 infections (positive for nucleic acid tests); (3) had a history of contact with persons suffering from fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or surrounding areas or in other communities where there are reports of COVID-19; (4) had a history of contact with condensation confirmed cases (situation within 2 weeks prior to the onset of the symptoms, exposure to 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical performance: (1) symptoms of fever and/or respiratory tract; (2) visual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or reduced number of white cells in the early onset of the disease and reduction of lymphocytes.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases, and there is any of the following evidence of pathology or serology: (1) real-time PCR testing positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire genome sequence of the virus displays high levels of coronary disease as known; (3) the special IgM antibodies and IgG anti-positive for SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or SARS-COV-2 speciality IgG antibodies converted from negative to positive, or drops increased by 60 times during recovery, higher than acute.
As we can see, the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020) added real-time PCR tests in respiratory or blood samples.
The fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) added blood samples to the pathology test; then the seventh edition added serological evidence.
These changes are based on the continuing work of researchers to study the best nucleic acid test kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory specimens, including blood collection, which increase the availability of different samples and provide evidence for the inclusion of positive results of specific antibodies in diagnostic tests.
In addition, there is growing evidence that alerts us to atypical symptoms and anesthetic patients.
Therefore, flow charts for Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify persons with no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
In addition, the scoring system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.
Finally, we want more direct evidence and call on readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend reference and follow the latest guidelines of the country in which the case is located.
Our team will also update our guidelines in time to help.

The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews on Al-Quds Al-Mukarramah and Medina to full-day curfews; prior to that, they had been in effect only between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the home order until 1 May.
Australian shops have reduced the maximum number of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sundays and Saturday nights, Australia's chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the cap on each transaction of sanitary paper to two and one packs, respectively, for all their stores throughout the country.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions are posted on the cashier's counter or on Facebook pages of a chain of stores.
It was reported that buyers were hoarding goods out of fear of COVID-19 in case they needed to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limits the purchase of toilet paper for delivery to a single package.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles introduced restrictions on the purchase of four packages per transaction on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
In its press release of 8 March, Coles reported that after the imposition of a four-pack limit, "many stores were still sold out within an hour of arrival" and called the demand "unprecedented," while Aldi called it "unforeseen" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworth spokesman, the sales were "a sharp increase" last week.
Last week, the Costco store in Canberra also limited the number to two.
In order to further alleviate the shortfall, Coles ordered more packaging from the supplier and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, and ALDI pre-positioned stocks for the planned Wednesday benefits.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Retailers, stated that retailers tried to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times made this difficult.
He expected production costs to rise and preferential activities to decrease as suppliers tried to meet demand.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores would not be able to hold Wednesday special events.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert at the University of Technology in Queensland, stated that stores were replenished every night.
He said that sanitary paper was a big item, that there were therefore fewer stocks and that once sold out, it left huge shelf space, adding to the sense of material shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths argue that if there were a lot of things on the shelf, goods like roll paper and handwashers could be bought and in sufficient quantities, you might not be so scared. " Russell Zimmerman said to ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures clean sanitary paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent sanitary paper, both stress that they are working all day and on weekends to secure supplies.
The real estate website Domain.com reports that some real estate vendors will provide free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne because of the relatively small number of auctions held by buyers on the Labour Minister ' s weekend break.
NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin City, contains eight pages in its Thursday edition to be used as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia, on 3 March, the store was initially reluctant to impose restrictions on purchases, which they said they did not plan to impose.
Russell Zimmerman added that there was also a high demand for other commodities, including masks, hand-washing fluids, dry goods, hand-washing fluids and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the British online supermarket Ocado limits the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 volumes each on Sunday night.
The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the continuing outbreak of COVID-19 (diseases caused by the coronary virus SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic.
While the term "epidemiological" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease and not to the risk of a particular case, WHO notes the need to urge Governments to take measures:
"All countries/regions can still change the course of the epidemic...
If countries/regions test their people, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize as a response, "The Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreesus, says.
" We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of proliferation and severity and the alarming levels of inaction ... "
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He commented at CNN in February that "except for the flu, no respiratory virus has been found to continue spreading to the world after its emergence. "
Ghebreesus expressed a similar view and said, "We've never seen a major epidemic caused by a coronary virus before."
He went on to say, "Same thing, we've never seen a controlled virus epidemic before."
Before entering the new state of the pandemic, in January WHO identified the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said that the outbreak was "most importantly, it was still deteriorating."
By Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
2019-2020 The coronary virus epidemic is a continuing epidemic of 2019 new coronary disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was confirmed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as an international public health emergency of concern on 30 January 2020 and as an epidemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, 210 countries and territories worldwide cumulatively reported approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths,
Healing about 36.4 million people.
China has a morbidity rate of about 4 per cent, while the global rate ranges from 0.08 per cent (New Zealand) to 13.04 per cent (Algeria).
Common symptoms include heat, cough and gas.
And possibly with complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The lurking period from exposure to the onset of the disease ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.
There's no vaccine or special antiviral treatment.
Clinical treatment focuses on treatment in support of symptoms. The preventive measures recommended include hand washing, covering mouths when coughing, keeping safe distance from others, surveillance and self-segregation of suspected infections.
Official agencies in various countries have responded to travel restrictions, segregation, curfews, dangerous workplace controls and facility closures ...
The epidemic has led to severe socio-economic shocks around the world, with the postponement or cancellation of sports, religion, political and cultural activities, and the exacerbation of panic shopping, which has exacerbated massive supply shortages.
Worldwide, 193 countries and territories have implemented national or local suspension measures, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of primary, secondary and tertiary students.
Xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asian descent and physical groups, and groups in regions with severe epidemics have emerged as a result of the spread of false viral information online.
However, reduced mobility and heavy industry closures have led to lower air pollution indices and reduced carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, the health department of Wuhan (Hubei Province capital) in China reported an unknown case of pneumonia, and opened an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the South China Sea Wholesale Market, so the new coronary virus is considered to be a common disease.
The virus that triggered the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, was a newly discovered virus closely related to bat-cranium viruses, mountain-piercing coronary viruses and SARS-CoV. The first patients were later confirmed to have a disease on 1 December 2019 and had no apparent connection to the subsequent cases of the South China Sea Fish Market.
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were confirmed to be related to the South China Sea Fish Market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unconfirmed report stating that the first case may date back to November 17, 2019, with 55-year-old males from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported a decrease in new reported cases in China, while Italy, Iran and South Korea reported a sudden and dramatic increase in the number of newly reported cases, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the territory for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially minor cases.
As of February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young people, only 2.4 per cent of whom were 19 years of age or under. Patrick Valance, the British chief scientific adviser, estimated that approximately 60 per cent of the United Kingdom ' s population needed to be infected with a new coronary virus in order to be immunized by an effective group.
The number of cases is the number of persons who have been tested by COVID-19 and who have been confirmed as positive under official programmes.
As of March 23, the proportion of people tested in all countries of the world was no more than 3 per cent of the total population, and many countries had issued official policies for populations without detection of light diseases, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March indicated that, as of 23 January, an estimated 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections in China had not been detected and that the unrecorded infections were 79 per cent of the recorded cases.
According to a statistical analysis published on March 30, the actual number of infections in Italy is estimated to be far higher than the number of reported cases.
COVID-19 basic infections (R0) were initially estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the Center for Disease Control in the United States suggests that R0 could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients can recover.
The period between the onset of illness and death is 6-41 days, 14 days most common.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 people died in COVID-19.
As of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths in China were among persons over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent of deaths were accompanied by both cardiovascular diseases and basic diseases such as diabetes. Official statistics on deaths in COVID-19 usually refer to those who, according to official programmes, tested positive for the new coronary virus.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths is likely to be far higher than the statistics, as it may not include untested patients, such as those who died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Part of the data from Italy shows that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is four to five times the number of deaths from the official new coronary virus pneumonia.
A female spokesperson for the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) said, "We know that the [published death toll] is lower than the actual number," and rumours that United States data are underestimated confirm this statement. Underestimating the frequency of epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
On 1 February, the first deaths outside China occurred in the Philippines, and on 14 February, the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France.
As of February 28, there were more than a dozen deaths outside China in Iran, Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods were used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region and are subject to testing over time, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the time of the first outbreak and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health status. Death rates are the result of the number of deaths divided by the number of persons diagnosed during the given period.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate as of April 10, 2020 was 6.0 per cent (97,039/1,617,204).
Death rates vary from one region to another.
In China, the estimated morbidity rate fell from 17.3 per cent (1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (1 February 2020 and 1 February 2020). Other measures included case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), which reflected the percentage of confirmed deaths and the percentage of diagnosed infections (including confirmed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and are tracked from infection to case resolution for a specific population.
Many scholars try to calculate these data for specific groups of people.
The evidence-based medical centre at Oxford University estimates that the overall infection mortality rate is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The upper limit of the estimate for this range is consistent with Germany ' s first random test of COVID-19 and a statistical analysis study of the effects of the detection on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization claims that the epidemic is manageable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and varies from region to region.
Maciej Boni, from Penn State University, says, "If not controlled, outbreaks of infectious disease usually start to stagnate when the existing host is exhausted and then begin to slow down.
But it's almost impossible for us at this point to reasonably predict when the turning point will appear. "
According to China's senior medical adviser, Chung Namshan, if all countries mobilize to adopt the recommendations of the World Health Organization on measures to stop the spread of the virus, "the end of the epidemic in June can be expected."
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that SARS-CoV-2 was likely to explode again and again for a period of one to two years. "
A study led by Neil Ferguson at the Imperial Institute of Technology showed that it was important to take physical distance and other measures before the vaccine could be put into use (which might take 18 months or more).
William Schaffner from Vanderberg University said, "This coronary virus is very contagious, and I don't think it's likely to disappear completely," and that it could turn into a seasonal disease, with an annual outbreak."
Re-emerging virulence depends on the level of mass immunity and mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some of the infected may be unsymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory salivation, loss of smell, aerolysis, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, cold, vomiting, cretin, diarrhoea or hysteria. According to the World Health Organization, about one sixth of the patients turn to severe illness and suffer from respiratory difficulties.
The United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) lists respiratory difficulties, persistent chest pains or stress, sudden confusion, difficulty of awakening and bruises on the face or lip as an emergency symptom; if these symptoms occur, it recommends immediate medical treatment. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, infectious shock and death.
Some of the infected persons may be unsymptomatic and have no clinical representation, but the results are positive, so researchers recommend close observation and examination of the close contact of the diagnosed patients to exclude the possibility of infection.
China estimates the rate of unsymptomatic infections to be very low at 44%.
Incubation periods (between infection and onset) are generally 1-14 days; 5 days are the most common. With regard to uncertainty, one example can be found: loss of smell among COVID-19 patients was initially estimated at 30 per cent and then decreased to 15 per cent.
Some details on the path of transmission of the disease have yet to be determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly through close contact and coughing, sneezing or speaking; proximity contact is within a distance of 1-2 metres (3-6 feet).
Studies have found that open cough can lead to the most distant transmission of the froth 4.5 m (15 feet) - 8.2 m (15-27 feet).
It has also been suggested that a longer stay in the air as people speak can also lead to the spread of the virus. Although the virus usually cannot be transmitted through the air, it can also occur when people breathe or speak.
It may fall on the mouth and nose of the people around it, and even be inhaled in the lungs.
Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) can cause the mist of respiratory tracts, which in turn can cause air circulation.
Also, if a person touches the surface (including skin) contaminated by the virus and then touches his nose and nose, it can also cause the virus to spread.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through manure, but the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission of shit. The virus is most contagious three days before the onset of the disease, but it is also contagious before and after the onset of the disease.
Positive results can be detected at the earliest three days before the onset of the disease, which indicates that the new coronary virus was contagious before the symptoms became apparent.
Despite the low number of reported cases of asymptomatic cases diagnosed in laboratories, a number of countries have detected cases of asymptomatic infection in the course of follow-up investigations by contact persons.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although the spread of the new coronary virus is not yet entirely clear, it is generally transmitted by one person to two to three. The lifetime of the virus on the surface of the object varies from hours to days.
Specifically, new coronary viruses are known to survive on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on cardboard for one day, and on copper for up to four hours.
However, the time of survival is also influenced by humidity and temperature. There are now cases of positive detection of pets and other animals COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals will retransfect the virus to humans, but official British agencies recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, as if they had been exposed to the surfaces of other people who might have been exposed.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) type 2 is a new virus, first separated from 3 cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the natural coronary virus. Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with home soap, because the soap solves the virus's protective capsule. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Now it's considered a human and animal disease.
Genetic analysis shows that this coronary virus is genetically associated with the beta coronary virus in a cluster of the Sarbecovirus and two bat-origin strains.
The new coronary virus and other bat coronary virus samples (BatCov RatG13) are 96% consistent with the whole genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that only one amino acid was missing from some parts of the genome sequence of the virus in the mountain top and the virus in the human body.
A comparison of the entire genome to date shows that up to 92% of the genetic material is identical to SARS-CoV-2, and that it is not enough to prove that the cross-drawn is the middle host.
The initial diagnosis of the infection can be based on the symptoms, but ultimately it can be determined only by reversion of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected secretion.
A comparison of PCR and CT studies in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and that many imaging features overlap with other pneumocococcal and disease development processes.
As of March 2020, the American Society of Radiology recommended that "CT is not suitable for screening COVID-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease."
The World Health Organization has now published several nucleic acid testing programmes for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
The nucleic acid test uses a real-time reversal of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Respiratory samples or blood samples can be used for detection.
The results are usually in a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is done by snorkels or by swabs. Many laboratories and companies are developing serum tests for antibody testing.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests had been confirmed to be sufficiently accurate to allow widespread use.
In the United States, serology tests developed by Cellex have been approved for use by certified laboratories only in emergency situations.
The typical imaging features of the patient's X fragments and computer fault scans (CTs) include the external grinding glass asymmetrical and chestless fluids.
The Italian Radiology Society is compiling an international online database on the image performance of confirmed cases.
The uniqueness of images that have not been confirmed by the PCR in the identification of COVID-19 is limited because of their overlap with other viral infections (e.g. gland virus).
A large study in China comparing breast CT results with PCR results found that although images were less specific to the identification of infection, detection was faster and more sensitive and could therefore be considered as a means of screening in endemic areas.
An artificial intelligence-based curly neural network has been developed that combines X films and CTs to detect the image features of the virus.
Measures to prevent the spread of the disease include good hygiene practices, hand-washing practices, avoidance of direct contact without washing hands, coughing or sneezing with a paper towel covering the nose and nose, and direct disposal of a used paper towel into a trash can.
The suspect should wear a medical surgical mask when entering a public place.
It is also recommended that measures be taken to maintain physical distance in order to prevent the spread of the virus ... Many Governments have restricted or advised against the unnecessary need to travel to and from the affected countries and regions ...
However, the virus has now reached the stage of community transmission in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community and that some community residents have no idea where they are or how they are infected. Medical personnel who come into contact with persons suspected of being infected should take standard precautions, access precautions and eye protection. Tracking the contact is an important means for the health authorities to identify the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The Government ' s use of mobile positioning data for tracing purposes has raised privacy concerns, and over 100 organizations, including Amnesty International, have issued statements calling for restrictions on such surveillance ...
Mobile applications are currently available or available for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions with privacy protection functions, such as the use of bluetooth to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
Users receive alerts once they have been in close contact with patients who have tested positive for COVID-19.
There are no COVID-19 vaccines yet, but many organizations are actively developing them.
It's recommended to stop the spread of the disease by washing hands.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially in the back of a toilet or when there's a visible stain on their hands, before dinner and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
This is because the virus can destroy its protective cylindricals by using domestic soap before entering the human body.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) has also suggested that if there is no soap and running water around it, you can wash your hands with alcohol of at least 60%.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
The surface of the object can be sterilized using a variety of solutions (the disinfectant works within one minute of the stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% polyvedone iodine.
Other solutions (e.g., benzachlor ammonium and glucose glucose acid) are less effective.
The U.S. CDC recommends disinfecting all regions, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, sharing electronic equipment such as tablet computers, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and patient-used ATMs, if new coronary pneumonia cases or confirmed cases occur in facilities such as offices or day-care centres.
WHO recommends that when coughing or sneezing, people cover their mouths with bending elbows or paper towels and immediately dispose of all contaminated paper towels.
Persons suspected of being infected are advised to wear a medical surgical mask because wearing a mask reduces speech, sneezes and coughs, and reduces transmission distance.
The World Health Organization has issued a note on the circumstances and methods of use of masks.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, says, "Putting a mask will reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, which is also a source of infection in the absence of adequate manual hygiene." In addition, it is recommended that the person responsible for caring for suspected infections wear a mask.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that a healthy person wear a mask only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for caring for the patients of COVID-19, although it recognizes that wearing a mask helps to avoid touching the face.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The United States CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommends that healthy citizens wear one-time medical masks, especially when they are in close contact with others within 1 m (3 feet).
Hong Kong, China, proposes to wear masks when travelling on public transport or when entering crowded places.
Thai health officials advise people to make their own masks and wash them every day.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, access to public places is strictly prohibited without masks or masks ...
On March 16, Viet Nam demanded that all people wear masks to enter public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires all persons to wear masks for entering the grocery store.
Israel demands that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, China, has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March, and on April 1st it began to demand that masks be worn on trains and inter-city buses.
Panama made it mandatory to leave the country with masks and advised residents who could not afford masks to make their own masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Measures to prevent and control infection by maintaining social distance (also referred to as physical distance) are designed to minimize close contact between people and thereby slow the spread of the disease.
Measures include segregation; travel restrictions; suspension, suspension and closure of stadiums, theatres or shopping malls.
In terms of social distance, measures that can be taken by individuals include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas, using non-contact methods of greeting and physical distance from others.
Now, many governments have forced or advised the affected areas to remain socially distant.
With regard to the largest concentration of people, the original proposal of the United States Government agencies and WHO was 250 people (in areas without COVID-19 transmission), which was quickly reduced to 50 and then to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two persons. Older persons and groups with basic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and impaired immune systems are at higher risk of severe illness and complications. The German CDC advised that such people living in the epidemic area should not go out as far as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify that the aim was to reduce physical contact while maintaining social contact, including virtual and long-distance contact.
The use of the term "social distance" implies a requirement of complete social isolation and does not encourage other ways of maintaining people-to-people links. Some authorities have also issued sexual health guidelines applicable during the pandemic.
The recommendations include having sex with a partner who lives alone and is not infected with the virus or has no symptoms ...
COVID-19 is recommended to self-segregate patients and persons suspected of being infected.
Health institutions have issued detailed information on proper self-segregation. Many Governments have imposed or recommended self-segregation for the entire population of the affected areas.
The most severe self-segregation instructions have been issued to high-risk groups.
If it is possible to contact a covid-19 patient, or if it has recently been to a country or region of wide spread, it is recommended to isolate itself from the time of eventual exposure to the virus for 14 days.
Epidemic control strategies include containment/constraint and mitigation...
The containment applies to the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of tracking and segregating the infected, together with other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
If the spread of the disease is no longer contained, efforts should be made to transition to a phase of mitigation: measures should be taken to slow the spread of the disease and reduce its impact on health systems and society ...
Both containment and mitigation measures can be undertaken simultaneously.
Sterilization requires more extreme preventive measures to reverse the epidemic by reducing the number of basic regeneration to one below. Part of the effort to control the outbreak is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is the levelling of the epidemiological curve that we know.
This would reduce the risk of collapse of health services and allow more time for vaccine and treatment programmes.
Non-pharmacological interventions that can contain the epidemic include personal preventive measures, such as maintaining hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-segregation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspension of schools and the cancellation of mass gatherings; community actions aimed at encouraging acceptance of and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning. In the face of a significantly increased epidemic, China immediately adopted stricter containment measures, such as sealing cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries and regions have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced large-scale screening and local isolation measures and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons ...
Singapore provides financial support for self-segregated infections and imposes heavy fines on those who refuse to self-segregate....
Taiwan, China, increased its mask production and imposed penalties on suppliers of medical supplies sold at the expense of the cover. ... Simulations in the United Kingdom and the United States suggest that significant challenges are facing both mitigating (but not halting the spread of the epidemic) and curbing (reverse the spread of the epidemic) ...
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak health needs by two thirds and reduce deaths by half, but they may still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Sterilization may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus ceases to spread among the population (or until the vaccine is introduced, whichever comes first), otherwise the spread will rebound quickly once the measure is relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have social and economic costs.
No special antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development is under way, including testing of existing drugs.
The use of non-prescriptive cold medicine, rehydration and rest may help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may lead to a deterioration of the situation.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied to determine their suitability for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also noted that some "traditional and family therapy" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
According to the World Health Organization, improving the handling capacity and adapting the medical system to meet the needs of the COVID-19 patients is a basic response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospital and primary health-care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the elimination of selective procedures where possible, the segregation and isolation of COVID-19 positive patients, and the improvement of intensive care capacity by training personnel and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There's a lot of speculation about the origin of the first case (so-called patient zero).
The first known case of new coronary virus pneumonia may date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of new coronary viruses in Hubei Province has increased.
The majority of these patients are associated with the South China Sea Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, a theory that the new coronary virus originates in some of these animals; or, in other words, that it originates from a common disease among humans and animals. On December 26, Zhang, a doctor at the Midwest Medical Complex in Hubei Province, first discovered and treated an unknown number of pneumonia patients and reported to the disease prevention and control centre in Jianghan District, Wuhan City, on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to a "Sars-like coronary virus".
Eight doctors, including Lee Wen-Lung, were reprimanded by the police for spreading rumours, while another doctor, Eiffen, was reprimanded by his superiors for sounding alarms.
The Wuhan City Health Council subsequently issued an announcement on 31 December and reported to the World Health Organization.
An investigation was launched in early January after the Wuhan Health Department received numerous reports of cases of unknown pneumonia. In the early days of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
Between the beginning of January and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China as a result of China Spring Festival population movements and the use of Wuhan as a transit and main railway hub.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases in one day, including 2 in Beijing and 1 in Shenzhen.
As of March 26, the United States had more confirmed cases than China and Italy, making it the country with the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide. As of April 9, 2020, the global cumulative report had more than 1.61 million confirmed cases; more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 cured cases.
About 200 countries and territories around the world have reported confirmed cases.

The initial British response to the virus was considered to be one of the most lax in the affected countries, and it was not until March 18, 2020 that the British Government began to apply various forms of social distance or mass isolation to its citizens.
The British Government has thus been criticized for its lack of speed and strength in responding to public concerns.

On 23 January, in response to a decision by the central Government to impose a closure on Wuhan, the representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that, while "it certainly was not a recommendation of the World Health Organization", it "had fully demonstrated the determination to contain the spread of the epidemic from the areas where the epidemic was most concentrated" and called it an "unprecedented public health" initiative. On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the outbreak constituted the sixth public health emergency of international concern since the outbreak of the flu pandemic in 2009, which was first introduced.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tan Desai, noted that the determination of public health emergencies of international concern was based on "global transmission risks, especially to low- and middle-income countries with inadequate health systems".
In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tandessai stated that "there is no reason to take measures to interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade", and that "the World Trade Organization does not recommend restrictions on trade and mobility".
On 5 February, the World Health Organization called on the international community to contribute $675 million to fund the strategic readiness of low-income countries, stating that there was an urgent need to provide support to countries that "have no supporting systems for testing people infected with the virus".
Tandesser further issued a statement stating that "the weakest link determines how powerful we are" and urging the international community "to invest immediately, otherwise it will be more costly." On February 11, the World Health Organization decided at a press conference to name the disease COVID-19.

Mike Ryan, Executive Director, Health Emergency Project, World Health Organization, warned in a statement that "This is a reality check on governments around the world: sober up."
The virus may be approaching, please be prepared, and urge Governments to respond correctly to avoid the worst-case scenario in the world.
Ryan further stated that the current data were not sufficient to allow public health officials to declare their entry into the global pandemic, which would mean "we basically accept that all people on Earth may be exposed to the virus."
On March 11, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of the new coronary virus constituted a global pandemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that he was "deeply concerned about the dramatic proliferation and severity of the epidemic and the reality of inaction."

The Group notes that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government should assume this responsibility ...
The expert group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against specific groups ...
The experts stress that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minors, older persons, internally displaced persons, the homeless, groups living in extremely poor conditions, detainees, refugees and other unidentified groups in need of government support ...
International governmental organizations are actively addressing the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform aimed at providing timely and comprehensive information and views and recommendations on policy responses worldwide.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the impact of closures and mobility restrictions, this number has a national policy tracking system designed to help countries learn from each other and to promote a global partnership to address the challenges of the new coronary virus.
As the pandemic first erupted in Hubei Province, China, the United States, United Kingdom Cabinet Office Secretary Michael Goff and Brazilian President Yail Bossonaro ' s son Eduardo Bossonaro criticized the Chinese Government ' s approach.
Several CCPC provincial administrators were removed from their posts for mishandling of vaccinations in China, reflecting central dissatisfaction with the response of local political institutions to the epidemic.
According to some commentators, this is intended to avoid public dissatisfaction with the Central Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping over the outbreak of the new coronary virus ...
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Liqin, denied that the formerly recognized COVID-19 outbreak had started with Wuhan and supported the conspiracy theory that the new coronary virus pneumonia originated in the United States or Italy.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, called the new coronary virus a "China virus" or "Wuhan virus" and called China's "censorship system has exacerbated the spread of the virus and turned it into the current global pandemic", which, in turn, was perceived by some critics as a form of racial discrimination and "dissipated attention from the failure of its government to contain the virus".
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the United States Government outlining a communication strategy apparently issued by the National Security Council, which states that "all of this is connected with China.
We were told, in any way, including press conferences and television appearances, to disseminate this message as much as possible "politics", "foreign policy" and the Bloomberg media claim that China's assistance to countries affected by the epidemic is intended to promote its global influence.
Josep Borrell, EU Foreign Policy Officer, warned that there was a "geopolitics factor for influence, including through good offices and generous politics".
Borrel also said, "China is promoting it as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States."
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and allegedly provided assistance to the latter two countries.

Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity. "
On March 22, Russian President Putin, following a conversation with Italian Prime Minister Kont, arranged for Russian troops to send military doctors, special disinfectors and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper newspaper quotes an anonymous high-level political official, saying that 80% of Russia's aid "was of little use to Italy."
The source accuses Russia of launching a geopolitical and diplomatic charisma offensive.
The Governor of Lombardi, Attilio Fontana, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "[Putin], in providing assistance to his American colleagues, believes that American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials will pay back, if necessary, as soon as they resume production capacity. "
The NATO "Defendant 2020" military exercise planned for Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea is the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the cold war, which will be reduced in size.
Kate Hudson, Secretary-General of the nuclear disarmament movement, criticized the "defendant 2020" exercise: "In the face of a global public health crisis, the exercise endangers not only the lives of the United States and many European countries participating in the national army, but also the inhabitants of the countries where it takes place." "The Iranian government is seriously affected by the epidemic, with about 24 parliamentarians and 15 other current or former politicians infected.
On March 14, 2020, the President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, wrote an open letter to world leaders requesting assistance. The letter stated that United States sanctions against Iran had prevented Iran from accessing international markets and made it difficult to combat the epidemic. The outbreak prompted calls for social policies common to other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child health care, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Political analysts predict that the epidemic could have a negative impact on Donald Trump’s ability to be re-elected in the presidential election in 2020. Foreign relations between Japan and South Korea have also deteriorated as a result of the global pandemic.
Japan announced that all persons entering from Korea would be subject to quarantine for a period of two weeks at government designated locations, and the Republic of Korea subsequently criticized Japan for "blind and passive quarantine measures".
South Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude to the crisis response of President Yin in Cao.
Many Koreans have signed the petition, some have called impeachment, accusing the government of mishandling the epidemic, and others have praised his strategy. The pandemic has prompted many countries to adopt emergency legislation as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this might increase government control over power.
In Hungary, the Parliament voted in favour of Prime Minister Olban Victor taking office indefinitely by decree, suspending Parliament and elections and punishing anyone found to have disseminated false information about the virus and government crisis management ...
The multiplicity of supply shortages can be attributed to the outbreak of a new coronary virus, resulting from the increased use of equipment, panic shopping, and disruption of factory and logistics operations to counter the epidemic worldwide.
The United States Food and Drug Surveillance Authority issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of supply ...
There is a high incidence of panic shopping, leading to the emptiness of essentials such as food on shelf, toilet paper and bottled water, resulting in a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the tech industry has been warning of delays in the delivery of electronics.
According to the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tan Desai, public demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has resulted in a 20-fold increase in the price of such products compared to their usual peaks, as well as a delay of 4 to 6 months in the supply of medical supplies.
The World Health Organization warned that this would pose a threat to medical personnel.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for buyers to sell Australian products to China.
This activity led to a shortage of powdered baby formula in supermarkets, which was banned by the Australian Government. Despite the severity of COVID-19 in northern Italy and Wuhan, there was no serious shortage of food in these two areas.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of and illegal trade in key products have been very successful and have averted serious food shortages, while Europe and North America anticipate such problems.
Agricultural production in northern Italy has not declined significantly, but industry representatives are of the view that prices may rise.
The emptying of food shelves is only temporary, even in Wuhan, and Chinese government officials have released pork reserves to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Italy has similar legal provisions requiring food producers to supply stocks for such emergencies.
The global economic damage has had an impact on China: a media report on March 16 stated that the first two months of 2020, as a result of the Government ' s measures to contain the epidemic, China ' s economy was hit by a huge shock, with retail sales falling by 20.5 per cent.
As mainland China is the main economic and manufacturing centre of the world, the outbreak is considered a major threat to global economic stability.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the market will remain unstable until there is a clearer understanding of the possible consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative impact of the outbreak on global economic growth could be greater than the 2002-2004 SARE epidemic.
An expert from the University of Washington, St. Louis, estimated that the impact of the epidemic on the global supply chain would amount to over $300 billion, which could last for up to two years.
According to reports, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was in a difficult position after the sharp drop in oil prices as a result of falling demand in China.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, as a result of growing public concern about the new coronary virus epidemic, various United States stock indices, including the NASDAQ 100 index, the Standard & Poor ' s 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, showed the largest drop since 2008, with a point 1,191, the largest single-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indices fell by more than 10% that week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China ' s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
People's fears about the new coronary virus led to a further collapse of the stock market, the largest in March 16.
People think the recession is an approximate event.
The economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the central banks and the states for taking timely and urgent measures.
Central banks responded faster than the 2008 financial crisis.
The tourism industry has become one of the most affected industries as a result of the travel ban, the closure of public places, such as tourist attractions, and government advice to avoid the impact of travel ...
As a result, many airlines, including British Airlines, China Eastern Airlines and Australian Airlines, cancelled their flights because of the decline in demand, while British feeder Airlines Flybe collapsed.
The cruise industry has suffered the most than ever.
Many railway stations and ferry ports have been shut down.
The epidemic coincided with the spring season in China, which was supposed to be an important tourist season.
The national and local governments cancelled a series of events involving crowds, including the annual Spring Festival, and private enterprises closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Disneyland in Shanghai.
Many New Year ' s events and tourist attractions (including the Beijing Palace and traditional temples) were cancelled and closed to prevent mass gatherings ...
In 31 provinces of China, 24 of the municipalities and autonomous regions have extended the New Year ' s leave to 10 February, requiring most enterprises not to resume work before that date.
These regions account for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong, China, raised the level of its response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March, and the New Year celebrations were cancelled. Retail trade was affected globally, and shop openings were shortened or temporarily closed.
Retail outlets in Europe and Latin America have dropped by 40%.
Retail outlets in North America and the Middle East fell by 50-60 per cent.
In addition, the epidemic caused shopping malls to have a 33-43% drop in passenger traffic in March compared to February.
Additional measures, such as additional sanitation facilities, the installation of heat scanners to measure the body temperature of shoppers, and the cancellation of activities, have been taken by shopping centre operators around the world. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the recession caused by the pandemic could result in between 14 million and 22 million more people living in extreme poverty in Latin America than in the absence of the epidemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, there were about 5 million unemployed people in China.
China has nearly 300 million rural workers, many of whom are held in homes in the interior provinces or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans were unemployed and applied for government assistance.
According to St. Louis' Federal Reserve Bank estimates, the new coronary virus epidemic could lead to 47 million unemployment in the United States, and unemployment could reach 32%. India's blockade has led to the unemployment of tens of millions of (daily paid) Indian peasant workers. An Angstrid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian families experienced some form of unemployment. Since the Spanish blockade in mid-March 2020, nearly 900,000 workers have been unemployed.
In the second half of the month, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for universal benefits. Nearly half a million German companies applied government-subsidized time work to their employees.
France and Britain have also adopted the German time-tight work compensation system.
The entertainment and cultural industries have also been devastated by the epidemic, and organizations operating around the world, as well as employees and individuals employed, have not been spared.
Artistic and cultural industry organizations strive to maintain their mission (usually funded by the Government) to demonstrate cultural heritage to the community, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and to provide support to artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, places of art and other cultural institutions around the world had been closed indefinitely to varying degrees, and the original exhibition, events and performances had been cancelled or postponed.
In response to this situation, efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The epidemic has also recently led to the cancellation of many religious services and the cancellation of major sporting and other social events (e.g. festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion shows) and the rapid intensification of this negative impact.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations to be held in Rome during the last week of Christian Pentecostal Ramadan.
Many parishes recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend mass on Sundays; some churches conduct worship through radio, live on-line or television, while others allow worship in their cars.
Christian pilgrims were not seen on St. Peter ' s Square as Roman Catholic parishes closed their churches and churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and shrines, or limited public gatherings were cancelled or restricted by other religious groups.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and the subsequent closure of the holy sites, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the worst damage to the world sports agenda since the Second World War.
Most major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including 2019-20 European League, 2019-20 British Super League, 2020 European League, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 All American Hockey Federation season.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to be held at the end of July; the IOC announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled to 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021". Casinos and other casinos around the world were shut down, and field poker competitions were postponed or cancelled.
This, in turn, has led many gamblers to gamble online, many online gambling sites to report a significant increase in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected by the suspension or cancellation of tour concerts by various music groups.
A lot of big theatres, like Broadway Theatres, have also suspended all performances.
Some artists have also sought to continue to create and share works via the Internet as a substitute for traditional live performances, such as live concerts or the creation of a network of festivals for artists to perform, publish and promote their works.
On the Internet, many web-based superstitions on the theme of the new coronary virus spread, and in a time of growing uncertainty, many people began to turn to humor and distraction.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, xenophobia and racial discrimination have increased against Chinese, East Asians and people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hatred have occurred in many countries and regions, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Many reports in February of this year, most of which were still confined to China, documented the racist feelings that different groups around the world are showing towards Chinese, who believe that they should be infected with the virus or accept so-called legitimate reprisals.
Some African countries have also seen anti-Chinese sentiment rise.
It has been reported that many residents of Wuhan and Hubei regions have suffered from geographical discrimination ...
On the Internet and online, there are voices that support the Chinese and residents of the most affected areas.
As the epidemic spread to other hotspots, Italy became the first country in Europe to have a serious outbreak of COVID-19, and people from that country could also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Some citizens, such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea, initially signed petitions to prohibit Chinese from entering the country in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, #ChinaDontComeToJapan (China don't come to Japan) has been widely publicized on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported an increase in racial abuse and attacks.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the new coronary virus the "China virus", and critics have argued that there is racial discrimination and anti-Chinese tendencies in his speech.
Ukrainian protesters attacked a bus from Wuhan to New Sanzari with Ukrainian and foreign evacuees.
Students from north-eastern India (on the border with China) and studying in major cities in India are also reportedly harassed by the outbreak of a new coronary virus.
The Chairman of the Indian People ' s Party West Bengal, Dileep Gosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature, "so God will avenge them."
These statements were later denounced by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta as "wrong." In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination against non-Chinese residents were also exacerbated by the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and should be the target of "waste disposal".
Many newspapers with payment walls have lifted the restrictions on payment walls for some or all of the reports on the new coronary virus.
A lot of science publishers have published science papers about the epidemic.
Some scientists also choose to share their findings quickly on preprint servers like BioRxiv.

2019 Laboratory tests for respiratory coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 viruses include detection of the presence of the virus and of antibodies following detection of infection.
RT-PCR detects the RNA of the coronary virus and determines whether the virus is present in the sample.
This test is a speciality test for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It can be used to determine whether there is a recent infection or whether there is an active infection ...
Antibody testing (serotesting) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Antibody testing shows how many people have contracted the virus, including those with mild symptoms who have not been reported or without symptoms.
The results of this test determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunization of the population.
Because of the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country/area had been able to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among its population.
As of March 23, no country/area had more than 3 per cent of its population tested, and the number of countries/areas tested varied considerably.
Such differences may also seriously affect reported case mortality rates, which may be seriously overestimated in some countries.
Real-time reversibility of the polymerase chain (RT-PCR) test using throat swabs will only be completed in the first week after the infection.
Normally, the results will be available in a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR testing using swabs will only be completed within the first week after the infection.
After that, the virus disappeared in the throat, but it continued to reproduce in the lungs.
For those infected who are tested in the second week after infection, the sample may be replaced by a deep-respiratory extract obtained through a straw or may use cough (silt).
RT-PCR was released in January 2020 at Charité Hospital in Berlin, which was one of the early PCR tests and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 23, 2020, the UK also developed a test method. On January 28, 2020, Korea company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical level based on the PCR's PowerChek Coronavirus.
In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain approval from the National Drug Control Authority of China for the urgent use of the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test box. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed 2019 new coronal viruses (2019-nCoV) in real time to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resources Department.
The early version of the test box used three genetic tests, one of which resulted in uncertain results due to reagent deficiencies, while the Atlanta CDC experienced detection bottlenecks; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The test method with two parts was not found reliable until February 28, 2020, when the state and the local laboratory were allowed to start testing.
This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Enforcement Agency under emergency use authorization.
LabCorp announced that it would be possible to conduct a CIVD-19 test based on RT-PCR throughout the country from March 5, 2020.
Quest Diagnostics similarly announced that it would provide a nationwide COVID-19 test from March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limits have been declared; sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing is the responsibility of the National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR) for development and production.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federation Health Surveillance Agency. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a reagent box for detection of COVID-19 infections. On March 13, 2020, a test method for Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA, which could complete a large number of tests within 3.5 hours, thus enabling a device to conduct approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the emergency authorization for the use of the m2000 system using the Abbot system (EUA); the FDA previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, an approximately 45-minute test for Cepheid was also authorized by the FDA for emergency use.
The FDA has approved a test method for replacing the PCR with a temperature augmentation technique such as nucleic acid.
Since the method does not require a series of temperature change cycles, positive results can be obtained in only 5 minutes, and negative results can be determined in 13 minutes.
The U.S. currently has about 18,000 such devices, and Abbott is expected to increase production so that 50,000 tests can be made per day. Taiwan is developing a test using monoclonal antibodies (specifically combined with the new coronary virus's N-shell protein) which, it is hoped, will provide results in 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid flu test.
A review of the literature in March 2020 concluded that "in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of the chest plate was small, and the performance of the CT [computer fault scan] could be obvious, even before the symptoms appeared."
CT has typical features of bipulmonary foliage grinding glass, with expansive asymmetrical and subsequent fabrics.
As the disease progresses, it will develop sub-pleasure, gravel path signs and pulmonary changes.
A study of PCR and CT comparing Wuhan (the first outbreak of the current pandemic) shows that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but CT is less accurate and many of its visual characteristics overlap with other pneumonia and disease.
As of March 2020, the American Society of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as a first-line detection tool for diagnosing COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC has recommended the use of PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to the infection is the creation of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections about seven days after symptoms begin in order to determine the immunisation of the monitored population.
The high flux automated systems in many clinical laboratories can perform these measurements, but their availability depends on the productivity of the systems.
For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by sequence samples, it usually uses an extra-week blood sample.
For PoCT, a blood sample is usually obtained with skin piercing.
It is not necessary to execute extraction steps before testing, unlike the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, FDA approved testing methods declared by 29 entities that are now able to distribute their anti-medical test kits.
As of April 7, 2020, FDA approved only one test under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Ommon Medical Experimental Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics' test kits were approved in Europe for the detection of viruses in blood samples, IgG and IgA antibodies.
Hundreds of samples can be detected within hours of detection, so much faster than the conventional PCR for testing the virus RNA.
Normally, 14 days after the beginning of the infection, antibodies can be detected. In early April, the UK found that none of the anti-test kits it purchased were sufficiently useful.
Hong Kong has established a home-based mechanism for suspected patients, "Emergency room provides sample tubes for patients", where patients spit in the tubes and send back the tubes at a later stage. The UK NHS has announced that it is piloting a home-based detection programme for suspected cases, which will eliminate the risk of patients contracting others when they go to hospital and the risk that ambulances will have to be sterilized after the use of ambulances. In the case of free discharge tests of the covid-19 suspected cases, medical professionals can take appropriate precautions to extract samples.
In Germany, on 2 March, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Doctors indicated that non-residential institutions had the capacity to conduct approximately 12,000 tests per day, and that 10,700 tests had been conducted the previous week.
If tests are conducted at the request of a doctor, the cost is covered by health insurance.
According to the director of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, the total weekly detection capacity in Germany is 160,000.
As of March 19, exit testing had been provided in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of persons tested in Germany was unknown, as only the number of persons who reported positive results was reported.
An initial laboratory survey showed that, as of the 12th week of 2020, at least 483,295 samples (including the 12th week of 2020) had been tested and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) were detected positive. Researchers at Technion and Rambam hospitals in Israel developed and tested a method for testing 64 patient samples simultaneously, i.e. aggregated samples, and further tested only when the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, the Great Genome of Hua (BGI) temporarily established a 2000 flat rice emergency detection laboratory called "Eye of Fire", which was put into use on 5 February 2020 and could handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
The lab was built five days under the supervision of Wang Jian, the founder of China's great genes, and the modelling shows that if the detection capabilities were not achieved, the number of cases in Hubei would be 47 per cent higher and the corresponding costs of treating isolation would be doubled.
Immediately after the Wuhan Laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai established fire-eye laboratories, which are now being established in 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily flux of laboratory tests amounted to 50,000 copies per day. Origami Assays released open source, multi-circuit design, allowing for COVID19 detection of up to 1,122 patient samples by 93 tests alone. These balanced designs can operate in small laboratories without automatic fluid transporters.
As of March, the shortage and insufficient quantity of reagents had become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some of the sponsors to explore a sample preparation programme involving heating samples up to 98 °C (208 °F) for up to 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on 31 March that new coronary virus testing had now been conducted for more of its population, with more people being tested than in any other country, and that detection levels were being expanded to allow large numbers of people to be tested.
This detection capability is achieved through the use of drive-through tests, on the one hand, and the financing of high flux laboratories to respond to large-scale crowd detection needs, on the other hand, to Group 42 and the Chinese Big Genome (based on its fire-eye emergency testing laboratory in China).
The laboratory was built in 14 days and was able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, the world ' s first laboratory of this size operating outside China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States have developed different tests for various parts of the coronary virus gene map.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing inspection test kits, sending reagent boxes for low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own reagent boxes.
The German methodology was published on January 17, 2020; the program developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States was used after January 28, limiting the detection capacity of the United States. Both China and the United States encountered problems with the reliability of test kits in the early stages of the outbreak, and the two countries and Australia were unable to provide enough test boxes to meet the needs and the recommendations of health experts.
On the contrary, experts believe that extensive testing in Korea has been instrumental in reducing the spread of new coronary viruses.
Thanks to the testing capacity established by the Korean Government over the past few years, it is concentrated in private sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programmes as the best way to slow the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The spread of the virus has led to a very high demand for testing, which has resulted in a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of scavengers and chemical reagents is beginning to strain.
In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test box.
In the United States, the test box developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government had subsequently removed bureaucratic barriers to private laboratory testing. Spain had purchased the test box from the Chinese company Shenzhen Erie Biotechnology Ltd. and found it inaccurate.
The company explained that the inaccurate results could have been caused by the incorrect collection of samples or the incorrect use of the test box.
The Spanish Cabinet has indicated that the recovered reagent box returned the wrong result and replaced it with another reagent box provided by the Shenzhen Bioeasi. 80% of the test box purchased by the Czech Republic from China was found to be incorrect. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China and found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that these test boxes should be thrown into the Danube River. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health stated that the test boxes purchased by Turkey from China were "high in error" and did not "use them." The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test boxes from China and declared them unusable in April 2020.
Positive effects can be obtained by testing, segregating those who test positive and tracking the history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive persons.
Researchers working in Vò, Italy (the first case in Italy of covid-19 patients dying), conducted two rounds of testing for a total of about 3,400 people, each of which was about 10 days apart.
About half of them tested positive and non-symptomatic, and all the cases detected were isolated.
New infections have been completely eliminated through travel restrictions on communities.
By means of large-scale tracking of contacts, restricted access to travel, detection and isolation, the transmission of the coronary virus in Singapore is much slower than in other developed countries/regions, and Singapore has not taken extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail places.
Many activities were cancelled in Singapore and residents were advised to stay home on March 28, but the school resumed on time after the holiday on March 23rd.
Several other countries/areas, such as Ireland and Korea, have also managed to contain the epidemic through large-scale tracking of contacts, restrictions on travel into their countries, detection and isolation, and less radical closures.
A statistical study found that the lower the case mortality rate, compared to the number of deaths detected, could be the result of better detection of only mild symptoms or non-symptomatic groups in countries where the number of tests is higher.
WHO recommends that countries with no detection capacity and limited country-level laboratory experience in processing COVID-19 send their top five positive and top ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for validation.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, "positive %" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
In other cases where the same conditions are present, countries that only detect inpatients have a higher rate of positive detection than countries that test all citizens (whether they show symptoms or not).
Hand-washing, also known as hand-cleaning, is a hand-cleaning act to remove dust from hands, fat, microbes or other useless substances.
Persistence to wash hands with soap at certain "critical moments" every day can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be transmitted by means of manure.
If people do not wash their hands before they touch their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membrane), they may also suffer from respiratory diseases, such as flu or common flu.
Five critical moments in a day when it is important to wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after cleaning children ' s hips or changing diapers, before feeding children, before meals and before and after processing raw, fish or poultry meat.
In the absence of soap and water, hands can be cleaned with grass ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing in the following cases:
Before, during and after the food.
Take care of the patient before and after.
After changing diapers or cleaning children's hips.
Wipe your nose, cough or sneeze.
Touch animals, animal food or animal faeces.
Medical manual hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
The washing of hands before the delivery of drugs or medical care prevents or minimizes the spread of the disease.
In the medical field, the main purpose of hand-washing is the removal of pathogens (bacterial, viral or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemical substances that may harm humans or cause disease on their hands.
Hand-washing is particularly important for people involved in food processing or working in the medical field, but it is also a very important practice for the public.
The health benefits of hand-washing include minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;
And to reduce the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study showed that improving hand-washing practices has contributed slightly to the increase in height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by advocating simple behavioural change (e.g., washing hands with soap) ...
This simple act can reduce the death rate of these diseases by nearly 50%.
Promoting hand-washing as an intervention could reduce the incidence of approximately one third of diarrhoeal incidents, with the effect of providing clean water in low-income areas ...
Handwashing with soap can reduce diarrhoea by 48%. As a spontaneous act in families around the world in schools and communities, handwashing with soap is the most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections.
Pneumonia, as a major acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, claiming the lives of about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause a total of nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund (UNICEF) has indicated that, compared to any single vaccine or medical intervention, more lives can be saved by using soap to wash hands before meals and after toilets, which can reduce deaths from diarrhoea by almost half, and from acute respiratory infections by one quarter.
As part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project, other sanitation interventions are usually undertaken while advocating hand-washing.
Handwashing also prevents the spread of haemorrhagic disease through direct physical contact.
Washing hands can have a slight adverse effect, i.e. frequent hand washing can cause dry skin, which can cause skin damage.
A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive hand-washing can lead to skin itchings, cracks, known as humid rashes or hand-skin inflammation, which is particularly common among health-care workers.
Excessively frequent hand-washing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive disease.
In order to reduce the spread of disease, it is essential to wash hands with soap in five critical moments of the day: after the toilet (urinary, faecal), after cleaning the buttocks of children (replaced diapers), before feeding children, before feeding and processing food before and after processing raw meat, fish or raw poultry meat.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, hands should also be washed in the right way: before and after the treatment of incisions or wounds; after sneezing, coughing or snorting; after touching animal faeces or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries/regions, hand-washing rates with soap are low ...
A study of hand-washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7 per cent of households had a hand-washing habit with soap. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 per cent; the United States was close to the average at 77 per cent; China had the lowest rate at 23 per cent. A number of behavioural change methods were now being implemented to promote the use of soap for hand-washing at critical times. In order for children to be raised with hand-washing habits, developing countries had the option of having children in school do their hand washing on a daily basis.
The "Basic Health Care Plan" introduced by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and education.
The core of this national plan is deworming twice a year, supported by daily handwashing with soap and brushing with fluorescent toothpaste.
In Indonesia, the programme was also successfully implemented.
Integrating soap or detergents into water would better remove microbes from the skin.
The main role of soap and cleaners is to reduce solvent barriers and increase solubility.
Water alone cannot be used effectively to clean skin because fats and proteins (parts of organic soil) are not soluble in water.
However, cleaning and washing hands requires reasonable water ...
Solid soap, because it can be reused, may retain bacteria left behind by previous use.
A small number of studies have investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap, and it has been concluded that bacteria cannot be transferred because bacteria can be washed out of foam.
But CDC still claims that "it's better to use non-contact liquid soap."
Anti-bacterial soap has been promoted in a healthy public.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antibacterials or disinfectants has led to the selection of antibiotics resistant micro-organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as trichlorfon, which has a large strain of resistant micro-organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistance strains were not chosen for antibiotic resistance, antiviral soap may not be as effective as publicity.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulations may contain acids (acetic acids, anti-hacid acids, emulsion acids), anti-bacterial beryllic acids, and more skin modifiers (americium, vitamins, mintols, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health shows that common soap has the same effect in the prevention of disease and in the removal of bacterium from hands as consumer consumer-grade anti-bacterial soap containing trichlorsa.
The hot water washes its hands comfortably, but the heat is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow fast at the body temperature (37 °C).
However, in the removal of natural fats containing soil and bacteria, warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water.
Scientific research has confirmed that the use of warm water has no effect on the reduction of microbes on hand, contrary to the prevailing view.
The water-free hand-washing or the non-washing hand-washing liquid is a non-water-based hand-cleaning agent.
At the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the twenty-first century, non-water-based alcohol hand cleaners (also known as alcohol hydrazine, free of bacteriicide or unwashed hand fluid) were popular.
Most of these hand-washing formulations contain isopropanol or ethanol, then add a denser agent, such as kapom (polymer acrylic acid) to form a gel, or add a wet agent, such as glycerine, to form a liquid, or foam to make it easy to use, and to ease the skin drying caused by alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide will further increase antibacterial activity.
Alcoholic handlids can kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (magnetic silicone (MRSA) and vrescocophiles (VRE)), tuberculosis and a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory symbiotic virus (RSV), nasal virus, cow pox, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
The alcohol content of 70% of the bacterium is used 30 seconds later to kill 99.97% of the bacterium on the hand (a reduction of 3.5 orders of magnitude, similar to a reduction of 35 decibels), and in 1 minute to reduce the bacterium on the hand by 99.99% to 99.99.9% (4 to 5 orders of magnitude).
Alcoholic hydrazine has little effect on viruses like the virus (norovius, also known as Novak, Norwalk) (most common cause of gastrointestinal inflammation). Adequate non-surgent rinsing or alcohol hydrazine must be used to completely humid or cover the hands.
Washing hands and backs and between fingers and at the end of all fingers for about 30 seconds until liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that hands wash rather than use free hand-washing fluids, especially when the hands look dirty.
Because such hand rubbing fluids are easy to use and rapidly deactivate micro-organisms, they are increasingly used; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing, unless there is no soap or water available for use.
Frequent alcohol-free hand-washing can lead to skin drying unless the formulation is accompanied by lubricant and/or wetting agent.
Glycerine and/or other lubricant may be added to the formulation to reduce or eliminate alcohol-induced skin drying.
In clinical trials, alcohol-free hand-washing fluids containing lubricants can significantly reduce skin irritation and skin drying compared to soap or antibacterial detergents.
Allergies from skin inflammation, exposure to measles syndrome or allergies to additives in alcohol or alcohol ducts are rare.
The low likelihood of irritation of irritated skin in alcohol without washing hands with soap and water is an attractive reason.
Waterless detergents, while effective, do not remove organic substances from their hands, but only disinfect them.
Therefore, free handwashing is less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens than soap and water, as these pathogens are still in hand.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand-washing is largely determined by composition and formulations, which have historically been much worse than alcohol and alcohol hand-to-hand fluids.
Recently, formulations using ammonium benzachlor have been proven to be sustainable and cumulative antibacterial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to be less effective after repeated use, possibly due to the gradual onset of adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can use grass ash or earth instead ...
Grass ash or soil is better than handwashing alone, but less soap.
One of the problems is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, then the spread of the disease may be accelerated rather than slowed.
Like soap, grass ash is a disinfectant, because it creates alkaline solutions after water.
WHO suggests that if soap is not available, it can be replaced with grass ash or sand.
The correct hand-washing approach recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States to prevent the spread of the disease is as follows:
Wet hands with warm water or cool water.
It's recommended that the flow of water is due to the potential contamination of the titanium basin and the water temperature does not seem to matter.
Use a full amount of soap to wash up again and again to create foam, while cleaning the backs of hands, between fingers and nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of using water alone.
At least 20 seconds to wash.
Washing produces friction, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, the longer they wash, the more bacteria they remove.
Clean it with flowing water.
Washing your hands will re-contamination.
Dry it with clean towels or dry it naturally.
Thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers and nails are the most often neglected parts.
Artificial nails and broken nail polish may hide microorganisms.
It is generally recommended that wet milk be used to avoid manual drying; dry skin can cause skin damage, thereby increasing the risk of transmission of infection ...
Where piped water and/or soap are not available in developing countries, a variety of low-cost measures can be made available to facilitate hand-washing, for example, by pouring water through a floating barrel or pores, and/or using grass ash to wash hands (where necessary). Where water supplies are limited (e.g. schools in developing countries or rural areas), hand-washing programmes, such as simple taps and other low-cost methods, can be used to save water.
The technique of a simple tap is to hang a can of water with a rope and then pour a small amount of water through a pedal and then use soap.
The effective drying of hands is an important step in the process of manual hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective way of doing things in public health.
More and more research has shown that paper towels are healthier than electric dry phones provided by many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, carried out a study sponsored by the European Tisse Symposium in the paper towel industry, which compared hygiene levels with paper towels, warm dry phones and more modern spray dry phones.
After washing hands, drying hands with a warm wind dry cell phone showed an average increase of 194 per cent in the total amount of bacteria on the finger and 254 per cent in the total amount of bacteria on the palm of the hand.
On the other hand, the amount of bacterium on the fingers has increased by 42% and the amount on the palms by 15%.
After washing hands, the amount of bacterium on the fingers was reduced by an average of 76 per cent and the amount of bacterium on the palm of the hand by an average of 77 per cent. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether dry hand methods could cause cross-infection among other bathroom users and bathroom facilities.
Sprayed dry cell phones are said to eject air at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 miles per hour) and can blow off microbes on their hands and bodies, which could pollute other bathroom users and bathroom facilities within 2 m.
With a warm wind dry cell phone, microbes can spread beyond the dry cell phone at 0.25 meters.
The results of the dry hand with a paper towel show no significant microbiological transmission. In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess different dry hand methods.
The following changes in bacteria have been observed after dry hands:
The study involved a number of different dry cellular producers, comparing these dry cell phones with paper towel hands.
During travel, without soap and water, you can choose to wash your hands with a sterilized towel.
Alcohol should be at least 60% free of hand-washing fluid.
Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor, found in 1846 that handwashing was effective in preventing the spread of diseases in hospitals, but only after a long time did medical personnel be forced to wash their hands.
The hospital uses electronic devices that provide feedback to alert hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
A study found that the use of these equipment had led to a decrease in infection rates.
The medical staff washes their hands for at least 15 seconds, using a full amount of soap and water or gel to produce foam and wash their hands in various parts.
Hands and fingers are tied to each other.
If there's debris between the nails, you can clear it with a hard brush.
Since the remaining moisture on the hand may still be bacterial, it must be fully cleaned and dried with clean towels.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to close the tap (where necessary, a paper towel should be used to open the exit door).
This will prevent the re-pollution of the hands from being exposed to these surfaces.
In health-care institutions, hand-washing is aimed at eliminating pathogenic microorganisms and avoiding their spread.
Reports in the New England Medical Journal show that in most medical settings, handwashing is still not acceptable, and a large number of medical staff often forget handwashing before contact with patients, leading to microbiological transmission.
One study showed that proper hand-washing, coupled with other simple procedures, could reduce the blood-flow infection rate associated with the catheter by 66%. The World Health Organization published a worksheet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-washing methods in medical institutions.
The organization also posted on its website a draft manual on health for public comment ...
Whitby et al. gave an overview.
If there is a need to verify compliance, then commercial equipment can be measured and verified against the Ministry of Health.
The World Health Organization suggested five moments to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluid
Before the sterile operation and
After taking care of the patient, adding antibacterial chemicals to soap makes hand-washing agents microbicides.
In an environment where antibiotic resistance is available before or in which there is a large number of micro-organisms before the operation is performed, it may be necessary to perform this fungicide operation. When the hands are "cleaned" for the operation, they must have water taps that can be opened and closed without contact, hand-washing fluids containing chlorine self-set or iodine, sterile towels that are then washed for dry hands, fungible brushes and other sterile tools for cleaning the nails.
All jewelry has to be removed.
This program requires the washing of hands, forearm up to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take long to wash (10 minutes).
When washing, you must prevent the water from flowing back into your hands.
After washing your hands, dry your hands with an insectless cloth and put on a surgical suit.
In order to reduce bacterial transmission, it is advisable to wash hands before and after contact with patients, or to use non-bacterized hand-washing fluids.
In order to control the vinococcal infection in hospitals, one finds that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands is that when the frequency of washing hands reaches 20%, when the frequency of cleaning hands increases to more than 35%, further benefits are extremely limited.
Compared to the use of anti-bacterial soap, the use of ordinary soap for hand-washing results in a more than threefold increase in the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food. Comparing the use of alcohol to hand-washing with anti-bacterial soap (30 seconds each), a lower proportion of bacterial infections with alcohol to hand-washing fluids was found to be 26 per cent lower than anti-bacterial soap.
However, the reduction of the H1N1 influenza (HI1N1 influenza A) virus and the indisputable cosmopolis (Clostridium dificile spoles) is more effective than alcoholized hand rubbing fluids.
Further research is needed on which interventions are most effective in various medical settings.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is considered an important cost-effective tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap or hand-washing facilities in people ' s homes, schools and workplaces makes widespread hand-washing a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, the presence of handwashing taps in every private bathroom or near a sanitation facility is very rare, even if there is a cheap way to build a handwasher.
However, the low frequency of hand-washing may also be caused by deep-rooted habits rather than by a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating the use of soap for handwashing can influence policy formulation, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioural changes among the population ...
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing hand-washing rates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and that social marketing activities were less effective. One example of a UNICEF-promoted hand-washing approach in schools was the Tristar approach, which, among other health requirements, encouraged schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When minimum standards are met, schools can rise from one star to the highest three stars.
Hand-washing outreach activities could include the construction of hand-washing counters to reduce disease and child mortality ...
Another example of hand-washing awareness activities is World Hand-washing Day, which seeks to effect behavioural change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronary virus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of a hand-washing emoticon.
Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing and DALY avoidance in developing countries.
However, reports indicate that the promotion of hand-washing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The first to recognize the importance of hand-washing for human health — especially for those who are weak (for example, mothers who have recently given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals) — were two pioneers in the field of hand-held health in the middle of the nineteenth century: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, founder of modern nursing science, England.
At that time, most people still thought that the infection was caused by what was known as the stench of poison.
The outbreak of food-borne diseases and medical-borne infections in the 1980s prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be more active in advocating hand-to-hand hygiene, emphasizing hand-to-hand hygiene as an important means of preventing transmission of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, in the public health room, office buildings and the bathrooms of airports have posters on "right hand-washing methods".
The word "till off" means someone who says he doesn't want to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
It comes from the Bible's Matthews, where Pontius Pilate washes his hands after deciding to crucify Jesus, and then turns into an extensive verse in some English-speaking groups.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth began to force her hands to wash the stains of her imagination, demonstrating her guilt at what she had done and at what she had encouraged her husband to do.
Research shows that people who think of or envisage immoral behaviour tend to wash their hands more frequently than others and tend to value hand-washing facilities.
Moreover, those who can wash their hands when immoral behaviour is envisaged are unlikely to engage in other "purification" compensatory actions, such as volunteers.
Religion requires hand-washing for sanitary and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand-washing of hands without soap is part of many religious symbols of hand-washing, including the Bahai faith, Hinduism, ablution (tevilah) and hand-washing (netilat yadayim), hand-washing in Christianity, and small cleanness in Islam. Religion and also hand-washing in health, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam demand the washing of hands behind toilets.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing before and after meals.
COVID-19 Workplace Control
COVID-19 Workplace control refers to the prevention of coronary virus diseases using hazardous occupational safety and health measures 2019 (COVID-19).
The adequacy of workplace risk control depends on the specific work site and mission and should be determined on the basis of risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the community disease and the risk factors for vulnerable individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.
As required by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-level exposure risks work has the least occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues, and it is therefore recommended that basic infections prevention measures be taken, including manual hand washing, encouraging staff to live in isolation after illness, compliance with breathing protocol and routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium exposure risks include work that requires regular or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected as a result of ongoing community transmission or international travel.
Including staff who come into contact with the general public, such as schools, high population density working environments and some large retail environments.
In addition to the basic prevention of infection, the group should be ventilated using efficient air filters and sneeze protection devices, wearing personal protective equipment and other risk control measures in contact with the COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers that there is a high risk of exposure for medical and paramedical staff who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients, and that exposure is extremely high if staff perform aerosol-producing operations with known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collect or process specimens from them.
Hazard control measures applicable to this category of personnel include engineering controls, such as a pressure ventilator and personal protective equipment suitable for their mission.
The COVID-19 outbreak could have serious effects in the workplace.
Staff members may be absent due to illness, needing care or fear of exposure.
Business models may also change, including changes in demand for goods or in access to them (e.g. shopping at non-peak hours, or using distribution or off-load delivery services).
Finally, product logistics from CIVD-19 regions with severe epidemics could be disrupted.
These plans address risk levels associated with various workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from family and community settings and risk factors for self-employed workers, such as older persons or groups with chronic diseases.
The plans also outline the prevention and control measures needed to respond to these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Infectious disease prevention and response plans may need to be guided by national or local advice.
The objectives of responding to outbreaks include reducing staff transmission, protecting populations at higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the response will be affected by the severity of the disease in the enterprise ' s community.
Hazard control level is a widely used framework for occupational safety and health. It is used to group risk control measures according to effectiveness.
If the COVID-19 hazard cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering control refers to the separation of employees from work-related hazards, rather than relying on their behaviour, which is also the least costly solution to implement.
Administrative control means a change of work policy or procedure requiring the staff member or employer to take action on his or her own behalf ...
Personal protective equipment (PPE) has less control than engineering control and administrative control, but helps to prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE shall be selected according to the level of risk to which the staff member is exposed, equipped as applicable (e.g., respirators) and must always be properly worn, regularly inspected and maintained, replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
Under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure risk work has the least occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended that all workplaces take basic preventive measures, including hand-washing, that sick employees be segregated from their homes, that they observe breathing protocol during coughing or sneezing, that they provide paper towels and garbage cans, that they be prepared to work remotely and, if necessary, off-duty, that they be discouraged from using other people ' s tools and equipment, and that they maintain daily cleaning and disinfection in the workplace.
The timely identification and isolation of potential infectious individuals is key to the protection of workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States recommends that employees with acute respiratory symptoms should be separated from their homes for at least 24 hours until it is determined that there is no heat, heat and any other symptoms, that sick leave policy should be implemented flexibly, that employees should be allowed to stay home to care for sick family members, and that employees should be clearly informed of the policy ...
According to OSHA, the risk of moderate exposure includes work that requires frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within a range of 6 feet (1.8 m), but may cause individuals to become infected with SARS-COV-2 as a result of continuous community transmission near the workplace or as a result of possible recent visits to the COVID-19 epidemic area.
This category of staff includes those employed in schools, high population density work environments and some large retail settings with access to the general public. Engineering control measures for this group and high-risk groups include the installation of efficient air filters, improved ventilation, the installation of physical barriers, such as protection devices for transparent plastic sneezing, and the installation of exit-free windows to provide client services. Administrative control of this group and high-risk groups includes the encouragement of home-based isolation of sick staff, the replacement of face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, the establishment of faulty shifts, the cancellation of non-necessary travel to the COVID-19 outbreak site, the development of emergency communications plans, including a forum to respond to staff questions, the provision of up-to-date education and training to staff on risk factors and protective behaviour of COVID-19, the provision of training in the use of protective clothing and protective equipment to staff requiring protective clothing and equipment, the provision of training in the use of protective clothing and protective equipment, the requirement of manual washing of hands, restrictions on the entry of customers and the public into the work scene, and the posting of signs on protective measures of the COVID-19.
This type of staff should be better equipped with respirators.
In the event of illness on board the aircraft, appropriate protective measures should be taken to protect the staff and other passengers, including by placing the patient at a distance of 6 feet from other passengers, assigning a crew member to serve the patient, providing a mask to the patient, or requiring the patient to cover his nose with a paper towel while coughing or sneezing.
The crew shall wear a one-time medical glove when they are caring for a sick traveller, touch a body fluid or a potentially contaminated surface ... The crew shall also wear additional personal protective equipment in case of symptoms such as heat, continuous coughing or breathing difficulties in the case of a sick traveller ...
Gloves and other disposable items should be placed in biological hazard bags, followed by cleaning and disinfecting of contaminated surfaces. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, dangerous control measures also include delayed travel in the event of illness. In the event of heat or other symptoms on board a ship, self-segregate and immediately notify the medical room on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up visits should take place in isolation rooms. For schools and childcare facilities, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control recommend that, if the infected person is present in school, the relevant school and childcare facilities be closed for a short period of time and thoroughly cleaned or disinfected, regardless of the proliferation in the community.
For medium- and low-level community communication, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of field visits, rallies and sports classes, other large gatherings such as choirs or cafeteria meals, increased distance between desks, mistaken attendance and departures, restrictions on non-essential visitors, and separate health offices for children suffering from influenza symptoms.
In the event of serious community transmission, consideration may be given, in addition to the implementation of a social distance strategy, to the extension of the suspension period. For law enforcement personnel carrying out routine routine routine activities, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control consider that they face a lower immediate health risk.
It is recommended that law enforcement personnel who must have access to the CIVD-19 identified patient or suspected individual should follow the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including with appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during the arrest process, the staff member shall first clean and disinfect his or her belt and equipment before using household cleaning spray or rag before it is used, and shall observe standard procedures for the sealing and disposal of personal protective equipment and for the sealing and cleaning of clothing.
OSHA believes that certain health-care and dormitories workers are exposed to high or very high exposure risks ...
Staff at high risk of exposure include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff with physical access to persons known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if staff members perform fly-over generation procedures for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collect or treat specimens of infected or suspected infected persons.
Scorch generation processes include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchial mirrors, some dental procedures and examinations, or body cavity sample collection.
High-exposure risk morgue staff include staff involved in the preparation of the body of the deceased, who were diagnosed or suspected to have been in the possession of COVID-19; if an autopsy is performed, the risk of exposure is higher. Additional engineering measures for this risk group include isolation rooms for the identification or suspected cases of COVID-19, including during the execution of the scavenging procedure.
Some health-care facilities and morgues can also be equipped with specialized negative ventilation systems.
Biosecurity level 3 precautions should be taken in dealing with specimens.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patient waiting areas be differentiated depending on whether or not the patient is a suspected case of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Authority also recommends that personnel working within 6 feet of patients known or suspected to be infected with SARS-COV-2 and those performing the scavenging process wear respirators.
The United States requires the use of N95 filter masks or better masks approved by NIOSH in the context of comprehensive documented respiratory protection programmes such as health tests, training, medical examinations, etc.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve staff comfort. WHO does not recommend protective clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not transmitted via body fluids.
WHO recommends that screening personnel at entry points only wear medical surgical masks.
WHO recommends medical surgical masks, goggles or masks, robes and gloves to staff members who need to take respiratory samples from the COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services to the patients without having to carry out the spores production process.
Medical surgical masks must be replaced with N95 or FFP2 masks if we are to perform a wave-generation program.
In view of the inadequate global supply of PPE, WHO recommends that the use of physical barriers, such as telemedicine, transparent windows, to allow direct care personnel to enter only the rooms of patients with COVID-19, to use PPE only when there is a real need for it in a given mission, to continue to use the same respirator in the care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, to monitor and coordinate PPE supply chains and to discourage the use of masks by insymptomists to reduce the demand for PPE.

Since this month, we've been in a difficult situation.
In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we have a clear sense of the shared destiny of all humanity and of our responsibilities to each other.
We face unprecedented challenges, but we are well aware that the best response to such challenges requires solidarity, cooperation and community-building around the world, which is at the heart of Wikipedia.
The e-mails, phone calls and chats that convey love and care to each other are ample proof of the difference between our colleagues and how privileged we are to work with you.
I'm so grateful and proud to be with you all.
Last week, we were commended for our work.
They made me realize how meaningful it is that at this moment the world has access to Wikipedia, and at the same time they made me realize the symbolic power that this vital resource is bringing to people around the world to keep functioning properly.
Whether your job is to run a website, pay for it or be safe in the community, Wikimedia can't function without your hard work.
The world needs information from Wikipedia more than ever before.
At this stage, the content of our work, and indeed the way it is done, will have an important impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities of our colleagues, we will begin next week with some important adjustments to our collaborative approach.
Adjustment of working methods and timetable
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss the company's working methods and schedule for the following days to months.
At the meeting, we considered what we consider to be appropriate responses to the current challenges facing companies and best practices to ensure that companies maintain sustainable development during the epidemic ...
The executive team has agreed to ease the pressure on the company's staff so that we can support the company's mission in the long term.
We support your efforts to reduce the pressure.
For all employees, contractors and contractors:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours per week), with subsequent changes to be notified.
This adjustment is not a holiday notice. If you work longer hours a day, we'll give you a job according to the length of your work.
However, given the unpredictable nature of the current world situation, priority will be given to your personal needs, such as caring for family members, shopping or medical consultations.
We're not following your hours.
If you're sick, please leave your job.
It's self-evident, but we'd like to remind you that you can rest assured.
You do not need to take sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team revise the work calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan of talent and culture, which will support you and ensure that your situation is properly monitored by the management.)
For the hourly employees, we'll pay them in full.
We have already expressed and reiterated our commitment to honour the commitments made to contractors and colleagues working hours.
The salaries we pay to all will continue to be calculated on the basis of the remuneration received for normal working hours under normal conditions.
Even if you're sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many have chosen to communicate with the outside world through their work to release their pressure.
Our work can bring incredible rewards, especially at a time like this.
But taking care of yourself is still first.
We ask you to keep in touch with the manager so that we can get an update on your situation and adjust accordingly.
Priority is given to securing important work.
We have to keep some important work going.
The work of the website reliability engineering team, the human resources operations team, the trust and security team and the fund-raising team (and others) is critical and may require additional support.
We will begin to assess current objectives with all sectors and shift our focus to support matters that are vital to our mission.
We all have a lot to do, but we need to focus on the most important items.
A temporary slowdown will not affect future developments.
We're not going to "overtime" after the outbreak.
We're not asking you to work overtime, because it doesn't seem realistic right now.
We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new targets and timetables as appropriate.
How will the APP (annual plan) change?
In order to adapt to the new realities and the requirements of day-to-day working hours, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 plan.
We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in return for more time to be spent on budgeting to enable staff to prioritize critical work and take care of themselves and their families; and to adjust working arrangements for those staff who need or wish to reduce their workload in the coming weeks.
The extended schedule can significantly reduce the current planned workload of the Organization as a whole and reduce the pressure on its work ...
If the proposal is adopted, we will update the follow-up work programme to delegates and teams as soon as possible.
Thank the APP team for their leadership in this process.
Office status, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a colleague from the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, in the interest of caution, we hired antiviral cleaners to completely disinfect the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-level disinfection solutions to disinfect surfaces and halls and elevators leading to our floors.
The office building is fulfilling its duty of care agreement to use the corresponding product to secure the tenants.
We believe that when you decide to return to work, the Office is well prepared to welcome you.
Our office in Washington, D.C. uses WeWork's office, WeWork shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and all Washington, D.C. staff.
By last week, the Washington, D.C. office had been converted to full-time telecommuting in line with the guidance we shared with the San Francisco office.
At the same time, as some New York office colleagues already know, we have been discussing issues related to the rental of office space in the Brooklyn District.
These discussions are continuing, but may be postponed.
Some colleagues were exposed to telecommuting for the first time.
Other long-range teleworking colleagues would like to provide them with some suggestions for adjusting their working methods:
It's better to have a meeting time within an hour or two.
If more time is needed, consider spreading the content of the meetings to multiple dates.
Meeting objectives are clearly defined, the agenda for the meeting is set and reading materials are sent in advance.
Videoconferencing is used as a default mode of meetings, with online collaboration and communication using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
In each meeting, a moderator is assigned to preside over the meeting, one person is assigned to monitor questions in the chat window and to track changes in the list of speakers, and another person is assigned to assist with the proceedings (or in a multi-person collaborative manner).
If you need comfortable headphones, contact technical support by e-mail.
Use your health allowance to buy snacks.
Join the #remotis channel on Slack to discuss distributional work with colleagues
The Human Resources Operations Team is studying human engineering guidance in the form of webinars to help all Fundation colleagues improve their efficiency during their distributed office hours.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel the public events funded by Wikimedia before the World Health Organization announced the outbreak.
These and other restrictions on the cancellation of activities may result in the inability of the recipients of these communities to complete their intended contribution activities, which we have informed them of, while at the same time promising that none of them will be punished for postponing or modifying these objectives ...
In the coming week, we will continue to provide more guidance in Wikimania and other district and thematic community meetings.
The global community now seems to be embroiled in the grief caused by the devastation of the epidemic, but it also reflects the relief of being able to maintain a clear focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT team will create a page on Meta-Wiki that will provide communities with a space to monitor impacts and track community communications with us.
Keep in touch and communicate issues related to COVID-19
We're planning a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00./07:00. Pacific time. We'll send you an invitation later on in your calendar.
At the meeting, we'll share some updates, answer your questions and set aside some time for discussion.
We're here to help you. We're here to help you.

Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and other members of the lead team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (AACE2) is an enzyme attached to the lungs, the arteries, the heart, the kidneys and the intestinal tract in the cell surface (cellular membrane).
ACE2 is expected to become a drug target for cardiovascular diseases by reducing the content of vascular tension II and increasing the content of Ang (1-7) to contain the activity of related vascular tension translator enzymes (Angiotensen-converting Enzyme, ACE). ACE2 is also the entry point for certain coronary viruses into cells.
The human version of this enzyme is commonly known as hACE2.
Angioplasty conversion enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metallic enzyme located on the surface of inner cells and other cells.
ACE2 proteins contain an N-end of enzyme M2 structure field and a C-end of Collectrin kidney amino acid trans-protein structure field.
ACE2 is a single I-type membrane protein with enzyme active structural fields exposed to lung and cell surfaces of other organizations.
Another enzyme known as sheddase disassembles the ACE2 cellular exterior structure area from across the membrane structure area and releases the soluble protein into the blood and eventually drains it into urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to a cell membrane, mainly a lung type II pulmonary cell, a intestinal ulcer cell, an arteries and vein internal cells of most organs, and an arteries smooth muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in the cerebral cortex, textures, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to counterbalance ACE.
ACE Disruption of angioplasty I to angioplasty active vascular tension II.
ACE2 ACFE2 (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) Pulmonate at the end of the platinum with hydrolysis as an vascular tension with an vascular expansion activity (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also crack many other species of peptide, including decompressuric acid 9, apelin, neuropressurizers, morphine a and stomach hunger.
ACE2 also regulates the transport of neutral amino acid trans-protein SLC6A19 membrane and is associated with Hartnup.
As a membrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronary viruses into cells, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (the virus that led to SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that led to COVID-19).
More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 S1 puncture proteins are combined with the enzyme structure of the cell surface ACE2, leading to ingestion and the transfer of viruses and enzymes to the inner core of the cell.
This entry process, which also requires host filtrate protein enzyme TMPRSS2, triggers the activation of S proteins, is currently being studied as a potential cure. Some assume that lowering the ACE2 level in cells may help to combat infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators have recommended the continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A system evaluation and an analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group."
And, "The use of ACE inhibitor treatment for patients at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with intermediate and heart failure, reduces the risk of pneumonia."
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, but the result is less reliable than the overall risk of pneumonia ... "
ACE2 (rhaACE2) is considered a new method for treating acute lung damage, which seems to improve the blood flow force indicators and the saturation of blood oxygen in the acute respiratory distress syndrome due to fat and sugar.
rhaACE2 half-life in human body is about 10 hours, 30 minutes active, 24 hours active (long time).
A number of studies have shown that rhaACE2 may be a promising drug for patients whose inhibitors are intolerant or for diseases with an elevated level of circulatory tension II. rhaACE2 has been evaluated by clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronary virus epidemic, help track people in close contact, and identify individuals who may have been exposed to the infection.
A number of applications have been developed or proposed in some regions and jurisdictions with the support of official governments.
A number of frameworks have been developed to build a close contact tracking application.
The issue of privacy has also attracted attention, especially in the case of systems that need to track the geographical location of users of applications.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of bluetooth signals to record distance between users and other mobile phones ...
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate this function in support of Bluetooth applications directly into Andre and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government has jointly developed an application to support citizens to check for contact with COVID-19 patients.
The program is now in use in more than 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an application called TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community and published as open source software and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia introduced a bluetooth-based application, "StopKorona!", to track exposures of potential infections and to help medical institutions respond quickly.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Health of Northern Macedonia.
As of April 14th, 2020, the application is awaiting the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the Government announced that the close contact tracking application was in advanced stages of development and would be operational in the coming weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar application.
Australia and New Zealand are considering the development of similar applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to launch a geo-fence application for patients with COVID-19 diagnostics living in Moscow to ensure that patients do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, cited a number of practical problems that could exist in the application system, including false positive misstatements, and the possible lack of effectiveness if only a small part of the population used the application.
To prevent the dissemination of misleading or harmful "cronar" applications, apples place restrictions on the type of organization in which they can be published in apple application stores, i.e. only in "official" or other organizations of good repute.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders have expressed concern about the use of coronary virus applications for large-scale surveillance, particularly whether the surveillance infrastructure established to respond to the coronary virus outbreak should be dismantled after the threat of the epidemic has been eliminated ...
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
These organizations declared eight conditions to be met for government projects:
Surveillance must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Monitoring and surveillance expansion must include sunset clauses;
Data collected for COVID-19 purposes only;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there is evidence of effective protection;
Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing with third parties should be defined by law;
Safeguards must be provided to prevent data abuse and to provide citizens with the right to respond to data abuse;
All "relevant stakeholders" are required to participate effectively, including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also issued a checklist.
Google/Apple's proposed plan is designed to address ongoing surveillance problems and remove them from the equipment operating system as soon as tracking is no longer required.
In some countries, web-based rather than application-based location tracking is used, and users do not have to download applications while avoiding being tracked.
In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
A web-based solution with access to the original location data may have serious privacy problems ...
However, not all systems with a central server are required to access personal location data; many privacy protection systems that only communicate with one another using a central server have been created (see below for further details).
Korea has introduced a system that is not based on an application to carry out a contact tracking mission.
The system does not use specialized applications, but rather chooses to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transactions data, and then combines that information to send notifications to potential infected persons through text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the Government has been allowed to disclose location information, as the country has made significant adjustments to its information privacy laws in the wake of the MERS outbreak.
The public has access to this information through a number of applications and websites, and some countries (including Germany) are considering using both centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, no specific details had been published.
It is a well-established idea to track close contacts with privacy protection, and a great deal of relevant research can be traced at least back to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working on privacy protection solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Power (BLE) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
PEP-PT is a coordinated programme with a centralized and decentralized approach and is not a single agreement. Decentralized agreements include decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly referred to as contact incident numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols and mobile link tracking mechanisms (PACT), etc.
According to these agreements, identifiable personal data will never leave the device, and all matches will be made on the device.
The MIT Media Laboratory privacy team has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection techniques when collecting and using position or path cross-data to track COVID-19.
The platform is based on the research development of the White Paper "Application Rotation: Preserving Personal Privacy in the Epidemic", released in March 2020. In addition, Enigma MPC, a company originally created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Laboratory and working on the development of privacy technology, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace uses security hardware technology to support users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, a global TCN coalition of groups was formed around largely identical approaches and largely overlapping agreements, with the goal of reducing debrisization information and supporting global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, which is a key to achieving widespread application.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore Government announced that its official government applications were using the Open Source BlueTrace Agreement.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which controlled Andre and iOS mobile platforms, respectively, announced a close contact tracking scheme, claiming that it combined low-power bluetooth technologies with privacy protection encryption techniques to protect privacy.
In addition, they publish the core technical specifications used in the system.
Apple and Google state that the system is planned to be rolled out in three phases:
Introduction of tools to support Governments in creating official coronary virus tracking applications that protect privacy
To integrate this function directly into the iOS and Andre systems, Google and Apple first roll out the system through an operating system update, and later remove the system in the same way as the threat of the epidemic, thereby addressing the problem of follow-up monitoring.
b Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, re-evaluation, redistribution or treatment conversion) refers to the conversion of an approved drug to another use for the treatment of a disease or medical condition that is different from its original purpose of research and development.
This is a research route currently under way to develop a safe and effective cure for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and blood transfusions during the recovery period. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins available for pharmaceuticals, each with multiple formulation combination sites.
The analysis of these combinations provides a rational solution for the development of effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SRS-CoV-2 target proteins include papaya-based protein enzymes, RNA dependent RNA polymerases, gyro-enzymes, S proteins and ADP nucleotide enzymes.

Virus carrier (I phase developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, 5 gland viral carrier)
In April, CEPI scientists reported that a total of 115 candidate vaccines were in the early stages of development, 78 of which had been identified as ongoing projects (79 according to the Mirken Institute) and 37 announced but with little public information (presumed to be in the planning or design).
Initial safety and immunoplasm tests are performed in the I-II period, usually random, multi-point tests against placebos, with a more precise and effective dose determined.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the best dose levels.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines actively developed (as of the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated.

Further random trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health personnel.
The vaccine under development may not be safe or effective.
Early studies using COVID-19 specific animal models, such as ACE2 genetically modified mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates, to assess vaccine efficacy have shown the need for biosafety level 3 containment measures to deal with live viruses and for international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines for SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.

Various social media articles have encouraged conspiracy theories, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and that vaccines are available.
Patents cited in various social media articles refer to patents for other existing coronary viruses (e.g. SARS coronary virus) toxic strain genetic sequences and vaccines.
2019 Coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) type.
Common symptoms include heat, cough and gas.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle sores, diarrhoea, stomach pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The lurking period from exposure to the onset of the disease ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, the total number of reported cases in 210 countries and territories worldwide exceeded 2.24 million and the number of deaths exceeded 153,000.
More than 568,000 people are being treated and rehabilitated. The virus spreads mainly between people through close contact, often by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
Although air-ejection can produce spores, they usually fall on the ground or on the surface of various objects and do not cause long-range transmission.
Also, if someone touches the surface contaminated by the virus and then touches his nose and mouth, it can get infected.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours on the surface of the object.
The most contagious three days before the onset of the disease, although it may also spread in the pre-infection and later recovery stages. Standard diagnostic methods are a real-time reversion of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) by snorkels.
Those suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
The recommendations on the wearing of masks by the public vary from place to place, with some authorities opposing the wearing of masks to others demanding them.
There's no covid-19 vaccine or special antiviral treatment.
Most countries in all six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus may be unsymptomatic and may also have symptoms of suspected influenza, such as fever, coughing, inactivity and heat.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory difficulties, persistent chest pains or chest cramps, blurred consciousness, difficulty of awakening and bruises on the face or lips; if they occur, immediate medical treatment is recommended.
A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, snotting or throat pain.
Different rates of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, were also monitored.
Some of the cases in China began with symptoms of chest and heart attack.
Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even death.
We call it a lurking period.
COVID-19 usually has a latency period of 5-6 days, but may extend to 2-14 days.
97.5% of infected persons show symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The role played by people living with an unsymptomatic infection in the spread of the epidemic is not yet fully clear; however, there is prima facie evidence that people with an unsymptomatic infection may contribute to the spread of the disease ...
The percentage of people infected without symptoms has not yet been determined, and research is being intensified. The Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of confirmed cases do not show any symptoms during hospitalization.
The National Health Council of China has included the cases of non-symptomatic cases in its daily circulars since 1 April; 130 (78 per cent) of the 166 infections that occurred on that day were not detected.
Both saliva and saliva can carry a lot of viruses.
Speak louder than the normal talk spatters more.
A study in Singapore found that open coughs can cause the most farthest transmission of a fly-over 4.5 m (15 feet).
Although this virus is not normally transmitted through air, the National Academy of Sciences has determined that it may be transmitted through biological aerosols and that the air collectors in the corridors outside the ward have detected positive samples of the virus RNA.
Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) can cause the mist of respiratory tracts, which in turn can cause air circulation.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted by excreta, but the risk is considered low. When a patient has symptoms, the virus is most contagious; although it may be transmitted before symptoms occur, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although the spread of the new coronary virus is not yet entirely clear, it is generally transmitted by one person to two to three. The lifetime of the virus on the surface of the object varies from hours to days.
Specifically, the new coronary virus is known to survive one day on a cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours on 99% pure copper products.
However, its lifetime is also influenced by humidity and temperature.
If properly used, soap and detergents can also have the effect of killing the virus. The fat protection layer of the degradable virus can be deactivated by soap products, which can also remove the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzachlor ammonium and chlorophenate (a surgical disinfectant), have had less effect. A study in Hong Kong, China, showed that saliva samples were taken on average two days after admission.
The first sample of 5/6 patients had the highest viral load, and the second day the first 6 patients detected the highest viral load.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new form of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-COV-2), first separated from three pneumonia patients in a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the natural coronary virus.
Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with home soap, which can destroy the virus's protective cylindrical. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cell through angioplasty enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has the highest concentration in the lung 's type II pulmonary cell.
The virus combines with ACE2 and enters a host cell through a special surface gluten protein called Pyrophoric.
Of the patients admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, 12 per cent found acute heart damage, with a higher proportion of patients suffering from serious illnesses.
Due to the deterioration of the pathologic process, the effects of systemic inflammation and the disorders of the immune system are high, but acute cardiovascular damage can also be associated with the ACE2 receptor of the heart.
ACE2 receptors express and participate in regulating heart function at a high level in the heart.
According to the information received, the high incidence of blood clot (31 per cent) and strangulation (25 per cent) among ICU-supervised COVID-19 infections may be related to pre-negative defects. The post-mortem examination of the deceased COVID-19 found widespread lung damage (DAD) and lymphocyte immersion in the lungs.
Despite SARS-COV-2 aversion to the episodic cells expressing ACE2, CIVD-19 patients suffer from systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, the pathogenic GM-CSF secretion T cells in COVID-19 patients are associated with the inflammation of iL-6 mononuclear cells and severe lung pathology.
The autopsy report also saw lymphocytes immersed.
WHO has published several disease detection programmes.
The standard method of detection is a real-time reversal of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually used for respiratory samples obtained through snorkels; however, it can also be used for snout or squid samples.
Normally, the results will be available in a few hours or two.
Blood tests can also be performed, but two two-week intervals are required, with little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate the strain of coronary viruses and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test agents to detect infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which not only detects active infections but also detects individuals who have been infected in the past) is still under development but has not yet been expanded.
In China's experience, the accuracy of the tests is only 60% to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the first immediate diagnostic reagent was approved by the United States FDA and put into use at the end of the month. The diagnostic guide issued by Wuhan University Central-South Hospital suggests methods for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Early infections are often seen in the foliage of the pulmonary, with extra-week asymmetrical and subsequent fabrics.
As the virus evolves, it may become sub-pleasure, gravel path signs (spullet spacing increases with different degrees of lung filling) and physical lung changes.
Very little information on micropathological injuries and pathological physiology in COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of the post-mortem examination were as follows:
Eye screening: plethoracitis, mitochitis, pulmonary fission and pulmonary oedema
Four severe levels of viral pneumonia were observed:
Light pneumonia: pneumoconiosis, pulmonary cell growth, large quantities of atypical lung cells, interterrestrial inflammation with lymphocytes and formation of multinuclear megacells
Severe pneumonia: Massive lung damage (DAD) coupled with diffuse lung osmosis.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Pneumonia recovery: osmosis in the lung cavity and interpulmonary fibrosis
Blood: dispersive intravascular blood (DIC); young white-young red cell reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include: staying at home; avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas; frequent hand-washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends covering the mouth and nose with a paper towel when coughing or sneezing; if there are no paper towels, use the inner side of the elbow.
It's recommended that you clean your hands after coughing or sneezing.
CDC recommends wearing a mask in public to prevent, to some extent, the transmission of the virus by the unsymptomatic patient. Central to the strategy of maintaining social distance is the closure of schools and workplaces, the restriction of travel and the cancellation of large public gatherings, thereby reducing access to large groups of infected persons.
In addition, the social distance code requires a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 metres) in interpersonal communication.
Since it is expected that vaccines will not be developed until at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are the key to controlling the transmission of COVID-19, which is known as the "rapid epidemiology curve".
At the same time, the CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially in the back of a toilet or when there's a visible stain on their hands, before dinner and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
In addition, it is recommended to use alcohol-containing hand-washing fluids of at least 60% alcohol, but only when there is no soap and running water around. In areas where it is not possible to buy water-free hand-washing fluids, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; peroxide is not a "hand disinfectant".
Add glycerine as a moisturizer.
Supported care for people, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support and other affected vital organ support.
CDC suggests that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple mask.
The in vitro Oxygen (ECMO) has been introduced to mitigate respiratory failure, but its benefits are still to be studied.
It is recommended to maintain personal hygiene and promote healthy lifestyles and eating habits, thereby increasing immunity ...
Supportive therapy may be effective for early infections of mildly ill patients. WHO and the National Health Council of China have launched an initiative calling for proper care for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.
U.S. critical pathology experts and lung experts have compiled treatment proposals from agencies and made them available free of charge through IBCC.
As of April 2020, no COVID-19 special effects therapy had been developed.
For some symptoms, some medical experts suggested the use of paracetamol (Acetylaminophenol) instead of Brockin for first-line treatment.
Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus and to complete operations that may produce aerosols in a medical environment, such as tubes or hand-held air, with particular attention to protection.
With regard to medical personnel caring for patients with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that, in addition to standard preventive measures, exposure prevention measures and air transport prevention measures, the patient should be transferred to the airborne infectious disease isolation unit (AIIR). The CDC provides an overview of the guidelines for the use of personal protection equipment (PPE) during the epidemic.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 Masks are authorized for industrial use, but FDA has authorized the use of these masks under emergency use authorization (EUA).
It is mainly used to prevent inhalation of suspended particles (e.g. dust), but it is not used for other purposes to ensure effective isolation of specific biological agents.
If there is no mask, the CDC recommends the use of a mask and, if necessary, a self-made mask.
Most COVID-19 cases have mild symptoms and do not require mechanical air conditioning or other options, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.
Medical staff are actively studying and hoping to provide respiratory support to patients with covid-19 who have symptoms of respiratory failure. There is evidence that air-injection can be avoided through high nose flow oxygen therapy or biphase airways.
It is not clear whether these two treatments will have the same effect on patients with severe illnesses.
If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use creative mechanical gas, as this technology can also limit the spread of aerosol particles compared to high nose flow oxygen therapy. Serious cases are dominated by older persons (60 years and older, especially 80 years and older).
In many developed countries, the number of beds per person is inadequate, and the health system is unable to cope with the critical situation of hospital admissions resulting from the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases, given the limitations of medical conditions.
A study in China found that 5 per cent of patients had to be sent to ICUs, 2.3 per cent had to be mechanically ventilated, and 1.4 per cent had to die as a result.
About 30% of covid-19 patients in China were eventually admitted to ICU.
With the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the complexity of mechanical air traffic has increased, and oxygen integration has become increasingly difficult.
At that time, pressure control models and high PEP respirators will be required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung damage and air chest damage from the respirator.
Old respirators may not be high.
Potential treatments have been studied since January 2020, and a number of antiviral drugs are now in the clinical trial phase.
Redeswell seems to be one of the most promising drugs in the world.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several of the drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing stages.
Severely ill patients can try to use antiviral drugs.
WHO calls on a wide range of volunteers to participate in potential therapy effectiveness and safety trials.
The necessary clinical studies have not yet been carried out to demonstrate whether the treatment is safe and effective in treating the disease ...
In February 2020, China released a mobile application to contain the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their names and ID numbers.
This application allows the detection of "close contact" by monitoring data, which in turn determines the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
Once potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends self-segregation, but also alerts local health officials. Combined use of cellular data big data analysis, facial recognition techniques, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence, tracking of infected persons and their contacts in Korea, Taiwan, China and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized security agencies to track cell phone data of persons suspected of carrying a coronary virus.
The purpose of this measure is to enforce segregation and to protect groups that may be exposed to infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, German telecommunications shared aggregated mobile phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute of the Federal Government of Germany in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deploys facial recognition techniques to detect persons who violate the rules of isolation.
According to Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera, mobile phone operators show that "40% of citizens are still walking around."
The German government organized a 48-hour hacker marathon on weekends with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for creative solutions on a global scale to prevent the spread of the coronary virus.
Isolation, travel restrictions, treatment of side effects or fear of infection, all of which may be disturbing.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connell, "Social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic depression are perfect storms that harm people ' s mental health and well-being."
The disease is milder and symptoms rarely or even show symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds.
Minor cases can normally recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover ...
According to other similar viruses (e.g. SARS and MERS), pregnant women are at higher risk of developing to CIVD-19 patients with severe illnesses, but lack data support for COVID-19. COVID-19 may have an impact on the lungs of some of the population, leading to pneumonia.
In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, schizophrenic shock or multi-organ failure.
COVID-19 related complications include sepsis, condensation abnormalities, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
6% of the COVID-19 patients admitted had condensation abnormalities, especially the extended time of the coagulation enzyme, while 4% of the group had kidney abnormalities.
About 20-30% of the COVID-19 patients have increased their liver enzymes (rotamino enzymes).
According to the same report, the average time between morbidity and death is 10 days, with an average of five days of hospitalization.
However, the average time from ICU transfer to death is seven days.
Early case studies found that the average time between the onset of early symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total time range of 6 to 41 days.
A study by the National Health Council of China (NHC) found that the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
A pathological examination of autopsies of lung samples shows that both lungs have a diffuse pulmonary damage accompanied by a cellular fission mucus.
The pulmonary cells have observed viral cytopathological changes.
The pulmonary image is similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the deaths reported by China ' s National Health Council, 11.8 per cent resulted from heart damage caused by higher calcium protein levels or sudden cardiac arrest.
According to data released in March in the United States, 89 per cent of admitted patients have a history of past illness. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region may also affect mortality.
Due to regional differences and methodological difficulties, disease mortality estimates vary.
Underestimating cases of mild illness can lead to overestimation of mortality.
However, if a case of death is caused by an infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop into serious COVID-19 patients and are about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or death. People are concerned about the long-term consequences of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority in China found that some of the recovering patients had reduced lung activity by 20% to 30%, and lung scans showed organ damage.
In addition, after recovery, there may be an aftercare syndrome.
As of March 2020, it is not yet certain that the past infection will lead to effective long-term immunization for those recovering from the infection.
The behaviour of other coronary viruses was identified as potentially immune, but some COVID-19 cases were reported to have been tested positive shortly after recovery.
It's thought that these cases are worsening rather than reinfecting.
The virus is considered a natural virus, originating in animals, by spilling infection.
The actual origin has yet to be determined, but as of December 2019, the infection was almost entirely interpersonal.
The first 41 cases of CIVD-19, published by the Lancet in January 2020, showed that the earliest date of occurrence was 1 December 2019.
The earliest reported date of the WHO official publication was December 8, 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the time of the first outbreak and age, gender and overall state of health ...
By the end of 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 to laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, U07.2 to clinical or epidemiological diagnostic infections COVID-19 but undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 deaths. The death rate is equal to the total number of confirmed deaths within the given time frame.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.9 per cent (153,822/2,240,191).
Mortality rates vary from region to region. Other measures include case mortality (CFR) as a percentage of confirmed deaths and infection mortality (IFRs) as a percentage of confirmed deaths, and disease deaths as a percentage of infected persons (including confirmed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and are tracked from infection to case resolution for a given population.
Although not all infected persons have an antibody, the presence of an antibody can provide information on the number of infected persons....
The Italian Epidemic Center Castigliene d'Adda is a small town with a population of only 4600, with 80 (1.7 per cent) currently dying of the epidemic.
In Gangelt, the epidemic spread through various carnival days, even reaching young people, but mortality is relatively low, not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.
Moreover, the German medical system is overwhelmed.
Blood donors assessed that about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.
To date, 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the total population) have been confirmed in COVID-19.
The effects of the epidemic and mortality rates vary by sex.
Research in China and Italy shows that mortality rates are higher among men than among women.
Males aged 50-60 are at the highest risk of dying, with only a 90-year-old gender gap similar.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are not yet clear, but may be due to genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-based differences in immunology, lower rates of smoking among women, combined diseases (e.g. hypertension) among men are lower than among women, resulting in higher mortality rates among men than among women.
In Europe, 57 per cent of men are infected and 72 per cent of all deaths due to COVID-19 are attributed to men.
As of April 2020, the United States Government has not tracked sex-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher, and the exposure to the virus is higher.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the disease was officially named "COVID-19".
The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreesus, explained this: CO stands for the coronary, VI for the virus, D for the disease, and 19 for the first outbreak.
This name has been chosen to avoid citing specific geographical locations (e.g. China), animal species or populations, in line with international naming recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that triggers COVID-19 is known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Respiratory Console type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, WHO uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in mass communication.
The disease and the virus are commonly known as "cronal viruses".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were widely referred to as the "Charone virus" and the "Current Wuhan virus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary viruses and disease names in accordance with the 2015 guidelines for the use of the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers have begun printing health-care materials, such as snouts and respirators.
For example, an Italian hospital is in dire need of ventilation valves, suppliers are unable to deliver components within the required time, a local start-up company works backwards and prints 100 ventilation valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, misinformation and false information spread rapidly through the network.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to other animals.
There's no evidence of copying the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.
Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively engaged in international research to develop vaccines and drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Solidarity Experiment" to assess the efficacy of the treatment of the four existing antiviral compounds that are currently most likely to have therapeutic effects.
There is no vaccine, but institutions at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells via ACE2 receptors, the previous work done by SARS-CoV needs to be used.
People are working on three vaccine strategies.
First of all, researchers plan to develop an all-viral vaccine.
The purpose of using such viruses, whether non-active or dead, is to provoke rapid human immune response in the event of new infections of COVID-19.
The second strategy is to develop sub-unit vaccines aimed at developing a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to respond sensitively to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, such studies focused on the S puncture protein of the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is to develop a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine development technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the pilot vaccines developed in the above strategies must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched the first clinical trial of the vaccine.
The vaccine contains an innocuous genetic sequence from the virus that causes the disease. The idea that the increased dependence of antibodies may be a major challenge in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials had been conducted.
Seven tests were evaluated and approved for malaria treatment, including four studies on hydroxyl chloride or chloroquine.
The conversion of antiviral drugs accounted for the vast majority of Chinese research, and nine three-stage clinical trials on Redshive will be conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and candidate drugs has been initiated. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently being assessed, including Radesive, chlorazine and hydrazine, Lopinave/Litonave and Lopinave/Litonave combinations of interferents.
As of March 2020, the efficacy of Redeswell's treatment has been confirmed.
It was observed that clinical symptoms of patients treated with the compassionate drug Redshive were alleviated.
At this stage in the United States, China and Italy are conducting III clinical trials. In February 2020, China launched a chlorazine (used in the past to treat malaria) study with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review of the study.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities have recommended the use of chlorazine.
But the Wuhan Institute of Veterinary Research recommends taking 1 gram a day, reminding twice the dose to be very dangerous and possibly lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued authorization for emergency use of chlorazine and hydrazine, but the doctor has the right to decide whether or not to treat the patients of COVID-19 using both of these drugs. The seventh edition of China's guide also proposes the use of interferon, Libavelin or Abidal hydrochloride for the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of Libavelin are in vitro inhibiting SARS-CoV-2.
After confirming the low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended that further body studies be carried out using nitronit. Studies have shown that the raw puncture protein caused by the trans membrane protein enzyme 2 (TMPRSS2) is a necessary condition for SARS-COV-2 interaction with the ACE2 receptor into the human body.
The chloroquine and hydrochlorine studies have serious limitations, whether or not they are used in conjunction with Achirocin, and unless further research is carried out, they will not be acceptable to the medical community. Ostaway has no in vitro inhibition to SARS-CoV-2 and has not been found to have therapeutic effects on COVID-19.
Cell factor storms could be complications in the post-treatment of CIVD-19 patients.
After completing a small study, the National Health Council of China included the TOC in its treatment guidelines.
Following positive results from the testing of patients with severe illnesses, Italy is conducting a national 2nd non-random test.
In combination with sero-protein blood testing, the identification of cell-based storms is designed to contain the development of the disease, which is thought to cause the death of some of the infected.
In 2017, with the support of retrospective case studies, the FDA approved the use of white cytogen 6 for treatment of steroid intransigent cell factors caused by other causes, the CAR T cytotherapy syndrome.
So far, there is no random cross-reference evidence to prove that the Torrent Monument is effective for treatment.
Research is under way to extract pure enriched antibodies from the CIVD-19 immune system, injected to people in need of antibodies as passive immune therapy before the vaccine is successfully developed.
SARS tried this strategy during the epidemic, but it's not clear.
The virus is a mechanism for the expected effects of passive antitherapy, SARS-CoV-2 immunization defence.
However, a number of other mechanisms, such as antibodies dependent cytotoxicity and/or ingestion, can achieve the same effect.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of man-made monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The amount of serum produced during the recovery period may be increased to facilitate rapid deployment. The serum consists of the liquid part of the blood of the recovering patient, which includes a specific antibodies against the virus.
Coronary disease, a closely related syndrome.
Dr. Lee Wen-Ling of Wuhan Central Hospital raised his awareness of the spread of the new coronary virus, which unfortunately developed COVID-19 and died.
