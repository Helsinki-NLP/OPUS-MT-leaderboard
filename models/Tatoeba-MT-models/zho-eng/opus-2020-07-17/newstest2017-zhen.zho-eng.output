A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead this week in the stairwell of a local mall.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who wanted to harm him and said, "It's all right now."
According to the San Francisco Coroner's Office, the body found on Wednesday morning at the Nishida mall was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
San Francisco Police said that the death had been convicted of murder and that an investigation was under way.
Louis Galicia, the victim's brother, told KGO, the ABC radio station in San Francisco, that Frank, who was formerly a stream cook in Boston, had found an ideal job as a stream cook at Sons & Daughters' restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman at the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were very shocked by Frank's death.
The spokesman said, "We're a small group of close family, and we'll miss him so much."
At this time of grief, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia says Frank lived in the guesthouse at first, but recently "it's all right."
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank found an apartment and was dating a girl."
Louis Galicia says he can't think of anyone who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a big heart.
Louis Galicia says, "Frank always cooks dinner for his family."
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He's a man of your word.
Louis Galicia said, "All things in the world could go wrong, but Frank called it a perfunctory man who glows every day."
Call the San Francisco Police to call 415-575-44444.
Primary doctor ' s strike: call for new labour action
Representatives of junior doctors have called upon the League to approve new labour action against new contract disputes.
The Junior Doctors Committee of the British Medical Association will ask all its members to support more labor action from the beginning of September.
According to the Board of Primary Doctors, the ministers have not addressed concerns about the contract.
Primary doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott a contract deal with the British Medical Association.
Fifty-eight per cent of the members who voted opposed the contract deal.
Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Board of Primary Doctors, in a letter to members on Twitter on Thursday evening, said that the Government had "always remained silent" on the issues that led to the boycott of the contract.
She said, "In the light of this, the Executive Committee of the Board of Primary Doctors has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has called for a resumption of formal consultations on all concerns. "
In response to the Government ' s silence, the Executive Committee of the Board of Primary Doctors has today formally requested the Council of the British Medical Association to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan to upgrade labour action from the beginning of September.
The dispute has led to six strikes by junior doctors this year, including the first full strike in the history of the British National Health Service.
Dr. Johann Malawana, head of the junior doctor of the British Medical Association, resigned after voting against the contractual terms recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting before the 54,000 junior doctors and medical students voted, he had said to members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, stated that the contract would be enforced among the medical staff in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Not in the Union"?
A gesture ends a crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday, when the two sides shook hands and announced an official end to the eight-month saliva and economic sanctions.
However, as Vladimir Putin greets the Turkish President in a golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I have a strong feeling that this reconciliation is the most desirable one for Ankara.
Yes, the two sides did shake hands.
However, even in the light of the standard that Mr. Putin has always held in his heart, Putin has only smiled lightly and has shown little enthusiasm.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is reported to have mentioned "good friend" Putin five times.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that his relations with Russia would return to the pre-crisis level, even higher.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdoğan was acting like nothing happened.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something the other way around.
However, Mr. Putin's continued indifference suggests that he forgot nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow had a very violent reaction.
Mr. Putin vehemently criticized the incident, accusing Ankara of being behind Moscow.
The attacks from so-called friends are even more unacceptable.
It's hard, or even impossible, to re-establish real trust on both sides.
Since November, Russian public opinion has changed.
For months, the government-controlled media have carried out an alarmingly full-scale attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
The most serious of these are accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdoğan’s family has profited from the illegal oil trade in the so-called ISIS-controlled Syrian region ...
He has categorically denied that.
However, the news from St. Petersburg suggests that it's time to move forward.
After all, the premise of this meeting is that Putin receives an apology from Turkish President Erdoğan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are obvious.
First, Erdoğan was pushed out of power after a failed coup last month, so he needed the support of all his friends.
The constant terrorist attacks have clearly hit him hard.
There's also economic motivation.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, particularly by banning charter flights that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has dropped significantly by almost 90%.
As the flight resumes, the Russian travel agency and charter company will be relieved.
They're about to hit the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
State television even this week predicts that the prices of fruit and vegetables will fall once Turkish agricultural imports are liberalized again.
A story from the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti says, "The tourists are there, the tomatoes are back."
This visit has added political value to Moscow as well.
Ankara was outraged by the West's weak response to the attempt to take over.
Moreover, Ankara is dissatisfied with the slow progress of EU accession negotiations and Putin’s long-standing involvement, which is keen to exploit political chills and weaken Turkey’s relations with the Western world.
Russia’s leaders will certainly get Ankara’s points because of their support for the elected authorities following the failed coup d’état.
Attention, this is a gift to Moscow, which has always had a deep fear of regime change.
Thus, the meeting held at this golden, glorious beachside palace has made Russia and Turkey ally with two nations that the Western world has rejected and abused, and an analyst described it as "unincorporated".
However, despite open reconciliation, significant differences remain between the two sides.
Moscow has recently played the role of peacemaker in Syria, while Russia and Turkey support the opposite faction.
It is foreseeable that, after almost three hours of preliminary talks, the two Presidents stated at the press conference that the subject had not yet been addressed.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two sides, which Putin stressed.
There was no clear consensus between the parties on how to reconcile their differences on the Syrian issue ...
The resumption of the dialogue between the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries in the face of months of open hostility and the possibility of a major catastrophe brought about by the fall of the Turkish forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve clients outside Scotland.
According to the Chief Executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the Bank will be simplified into a logistics department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEun told BBC Scotland that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand was dedicated to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, I was on the verge of collapse, and I had to accept relief from that point on.
During that time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group spent millions of pounds to sponsor the six-nation football and Winboldon tennis championship champion Andy Murray in the international sports competition.
But now, the right thing to do is get more brands out of the country.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish clients, but will not be restored.
In England and Wales, all references other than headquarters and stock exchanges will be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The Alster brand has been used by clients in the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Autonomous Region.
There are other, more prominent, smaller private bank brands, such as the Censorship Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEun was interviewed on a visit to Inverness County by clients and employees.
He told BBC Scotland that "The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employee brands, because we are now, in the larger sense, a bank with a lot of brands."
Because the bank itself became an international brand, the RBS became a global brand.
Now, what I'm going to say is that we're not focusing on the world anymore, we've turned our eyes to our own land.
Each brand represents a different industry, and our employees serve their clients through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation championships; at the same time, efforts have been made to raise the profile of different brands sponsoring sporting events.
The CEO said, "It's time to become a multi-brand bank, because in private we've been looking for ways to be a better bank for our clients."
It would be a mockery if we were to become a big bank with a lot of brands three years ago.
We're focusing on client needs and I'm sure you've noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and now is the right time.
Dituly won his career at Newmuckett with the success of Predilection.
Newmuckiet's two victories, Dituli, won his profession by 3,000, and then he's wearing champagne to celebrate.
Friday, professional horse jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th victory in Newmarket.
He's got his trainer, John Gosden, on the street, and he's won two victories that night, and he's won 3,000 jobs.
This 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional horse jockey to achieve this milestone in the field of the flat-field race.
The first five are: Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion rider of Ghayyar said, "It's special."
I'm excited because my family was there.
I'm happy about what I did in Newmuckett, because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big race, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's just a normal Friday night with 20,000 viewers.
I'm glad and humble.
After the victory, Daituli brought it in, and the whole place was cheered.
In the barrier field, two jockeys, Sir Richard Johnson, the champion, and Sir Anthony McCoy, the 20-year-old champion, who won more than 4,300 victories in his record career.
Berger was a nine-time German champion. He won 4,493 victories in his career.
Dayturi is one of the best jockeys of our time, so it's not surprising that he's achieved this milestone, and not many people have done so before him.
He's fashionable and he's strong, but he's tactically rational that really made him out of the heavy room.
He's an amazing horseman, and his passion and charm have attracted a lot of fans to this movement over the years.
A few weeks ago, I told Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend with a jockey, he would have won 6,000!
Seriously, it's so important that Datouri is the best horse winner in Britain in 30 years.
He's a very lively man, and it's a good thing for the English horse racer, but beyond that, he's an incredible jockey.
Daytouri celebrates this milestone with his iconic leap.
From jumping through the line to jumping off the horse, for 20 years Detouri has been a typical representative of the British track.
His career is like a roller coaster.
He won a number of championships, including the famous "Seven Leagues" at the Royal Escobar in 1996, but he also suffered a plane crash and was banned from the race for taking the forbidden drugs.
Three years ago, when he came back to the field after the six-month period, he had had a hard time, but he showed an amazing personality advantage and finally returned to the top, giving the skeptics the head.
He may not be able to do it long enough -- he said before that he wanted to be in the race at least until he was 50.
Russian President Putin relieved Sergei Ivanov of his post as Director-General of the Office
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly removed Sergei Ivanov from the post of Presidential Chef de Cabinet.
For many years, Mr. Ivanov has been part of a core group that has gained Mr. Putin's trust.
Ivanov, 63 years old, has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
A Kremlin statement stated that Mr. Putin had "promulgated the removal of Ivanov from the post of Head of the Russian President's Office", but did not give any reasons.
Anton Vaino, who started as Mr. Ivanov ' s deputy in 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Mr. Vaino is 44 years old, a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, graduated from the famous Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he managed the President's draft and government employees, the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Mr. Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of this government is to support the Head of State in drafting laws and controlling the implementation of directives.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov had requested his resignation and recommended Mr. Vaino to take over.
Is that a good smile?
Moscow is confused with this move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest assistants and, like Putin, worked at the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As Chef de Cabinet, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcasted on national television, both claimed that the Chef de Cabinet had requested his resignation.
Despite the smile in front of the camera, there's hardly anyone to believe -- especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of a defeat in some sort of power struggle?
I don't know yet.
But the official argument — that a candidate who was once considered a presidential candidate suddenly chose to dominate Russia's environmental policy — has raised a lot of doubts.
Mr. Ivanov ' s dialogue with Mr. Putin was quoted on the Kremlin website, and he said, "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you to give me this difficult position, even a difficult one, for a four-year term."
"The result is that I've been Presidential Chef de Cabinet for four years and eight months. "
Mr. Ivanov took up this position in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, a former member of the State Security Service.
At the end of the 1990s, when Mr. Putin was head of the Federal Security Agency (FSB), formerly the National Security Agency, Mr. Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he named Mr. Ivanov one of his five most trusted.
At one point, it was thought that Mr. Ivanov might be President of Russia after Mr. Putin's second term, because three re-elections would be unconstitutional.
But the position was ultimately attributed to Dmitry Medvedev, another close assistant to Putin.
Before returning to office three and a half years later, Mr. Putin assumed the post of Prime Minister of Russia.
The mystery fish came out, Banff. A garden.
One of Banff's residents found a fish in his garden and sent a request for help.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could have been saloons from a sea tornado.
Mr. Bain lives about 500 metres from the sea, and he posted this weird scene on Periscope, hoping that someone could explain to him why these two-inch-long fish would be present.
The Quince Ferry Bridge has now reached Farf.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north side of the Queensfery Crossing bridge to the high bridge, which means the bridge is now reaching Farf.
Around the three bridgeheads near each bridge, the bridge windmills are now nearing completion, and the project is the first dragon bridge.
The bridge, which started in Farf, is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It used 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 slant drops.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited the site today and became one of the first people to board the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment in the construction of the Quince Ferry Bridge."
We have all witnessed engineering work on such an ambitious project, and this part of the bridge alone uses more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel.
Although the size and weight of the bridge are enormous, the completion of the dragons between the high bridge and the bridge surface requires fine work and very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79 per cent of the main bridge is now installed, and the last section of the bridge, the concrete bridge, is poured today at Rosyth, which means that all the bridges are ready.
Michael Martin, the director of the Quince Ferry Bridge Construction Project, said, "The first one is a major milestone for any bridge project."
For that remarkable project, this one shows the cutting edge of civil engineering technology.
Once the last section of the road panel is installed and connected to the expanded North Bridge road panel, the remaining gaps on the north side or close to the land side will need to be completed.
To complete this operation, the northern high-rise bridge needs to be moved south 700 mm.
It's a huge operation, and it's a very sophisticated one.
It's huge because it's 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 metric tons and takes about 3% of the slope.
It's sophisticated because the engineering team needs to make sure it's very small, with a few millimeters on each side.
It's good to know that everything's going well.
Simon Bails picks up a female gymnastic champion.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is not affected by all of this.
It's full of energy.
There's more to the balance of the upper wood blades.
Free gymnastics is amazing.
The whole show was brilliant.
Now, at last, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnastics player who took the all-embracing champion on Thursday, fully demonstrated her talent in gymnastics at the Olympics.
She's a 62,298 winner, the Final Five, Aly Raisman, and the bronze winner, Aliya Mustafaina.
Simón-Bails from the United States performed a balanced wood show at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byers helped the U.S. team to achieve four consecutive championships in female gymnastics at the Olympics, where she personally won five medals, further proving that she is the generation and possibly the best gymnast in history.
When I saw my share, Byers couldn't help but shed tears, and she finally ended this long journey.
As a result, Bayers joins Michael-Phelps in the "Ten Years Academies", raising sports in their respective fields to new heights:
Bayers has been known as the Grand Prix for the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold medals. She has been trained daily with a keen will to achieve greater accuracy. Mary Lou Retton, the 1984 Olympic champion, said: "Bails is the best gymnast I've ever seen."
There's a last match in Brazil, but it's not so much a competition between Byers and other gymnastics players, it's a struggle between herself and the pressure of great expectations.
If Byers didn't return to her home in Spring, Texas, with all the gold, everyone would be disappointed.
Simon Bails from the United States hugged with Leisman, who won gold and silver medals at the all-women artistic gymnastics finals of the 2016 Summer Olympics, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August.
Byers won the first gold medal on Tuesday to give a surprise gift to Martha Karolyi, the soon-to-be-retired coach of the national team.
Although Byers insisted that he had no plans for the future in the long run of the Throne, that was not the case.
One of the pieces of Byers' free gymnastics -- the one with her iconic ups and downs -- was accompanied by Latin music, which she used to hear in her home only a block away from the Olympics in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her grandparents as a baby and found by the mother of the coach Amy Boorman during a field trip to the gym has now grown into a strong force.
Since the summer of 2013, Bayers hasn't lost in the All-power game, and if she wants to win, she'll win.
It's just an illusion that Mustafa's two rotations lead a little bit.
Balancing wood with free gymnastics is the world champion Bayers is waiting for.
Her balancewood score is 15,433, and her free gymnastics score is 15,933.
While waiting for the final score to come out, Lesman hugged Byers, and when Byers learned of what he had dreamed of, he left tears behind.
Leisman behaved a little like revenge four years ago, when she was in third place, but she lost to Mustafaina in the finals.
But this time, this 22-year-old captain, called "Grandma" by the Americans, is far ahead.
She was kissing the crowd after her free gymnastics had ended and declared her return, but sometimes it seemed questionable before that return.
Since earlier this week, news has spread virally on Twitter.
6-year-old Mahaj Brown survived the Philadelphia shooting.
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old to be shot this week.
His grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
They say Brown's groin, leg, arm and abdomen have multiple gunshot wounds, but the kid was sober on his way to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body's been hit by bullets, and his grandmother, Delores Meléndez, said to the TV station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone multiple surgery.
His family told the TV station that the child was on the verge of recovery.
He was about to start his first grade in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Of the other three shot, two were 29 years old and one was 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition; the other two were stable.
According to TV, the child and the 29-year-old victim were found in the front seat of the car.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether there were gunmen among the wounded.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like multiple shooters were engaged.
There's a lot of shells of offensive weapons found on the scene, which leads to the inference that they use different offensive weapons.
So, it's definitely a continuous war.
There's shells on the sidewalks on both sides of the street.
So, it can be seen that a number of armed men were in a state of heavy war, and the Philadelphia police chief, Anthony Ginaldi, said to the TV station.
There's been a lot of damage to houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have yet been made and the police are said to be looking at surveillance footage.
Tuesday, a six-year-old girl was shot in the arm by a stray bullet while playing in front of a home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering. The police are still after the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie?
That's how I rate this year's women's Olympic gymnastics for more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984, I've been to every summer Olympics, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Secondly, the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts - Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have been inspiring many colored girls.
The formation of this team is a source of great pride for all because it includes Aly Raisman of Judaism and Madison Kocian of Catholicism.
This team finally looks like the American team.
It also consolidates the peak of black and Latino women in this movement.
In the last four years, the leading female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel were ranked first and second.
That's amazing.
The last Olympics, Gabriel Douglas, "unfortunately" became Olympic champions, cheering America.
Today, the world has witnessed three world champions, Simon Byers, Douglas and Laurie Hernández, who have shaped the conventional gymnastics.
On Thursday, Simon helped the American team achieve four consecutive championships on the Women's Personal Capability Project.
Her teammate, Ali Leisman, got a silver medal.
We're at the top of the sport, but not in the gymnastics class in America.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie have the same access to the Olympics as Ali and Madison.
They're the Final Five, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will be composed of four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year of teaching.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is a costly exercise, that gymnasts are trained mainly in private gymnastics clubs and that their parents have to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel fees (including associated costs for coaches and gymnasts and family members) and that the list of fees is increasing.
Most gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the industry.
All gymnastics training is done in these clubs, and it's a long and expensive expense for gymnastics families.
Aimee Boorman's coach and Maggie Haney's coach from Hernández have been teaching gymnastics since the start of their gymnastics.
We must bring more physical and gymnastics training to the countless young girls affected by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I founded my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we provide free, cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Hispanic Americans) in black residential areas and develop national and world champions.
In September, we will expand Detroit to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this opportunity to learn and who will benefit from this remarkable Olympic movement.
Gymnastics helps to develop body strength, flexibility and harmony, as well as a spirit of hard work, self-discipline and determination.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person ' s health, education and success in his or her work.
I'm encouraged by this team that thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
It's important to be in sports, especially for girls.
It's an exciting moment.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for their wonderful "Girl Power" in winning Olympic gold medals, and for inspiring young girls of so many different backgrounds to begin the path to health, strength and success.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, the primary physician planned to launch a further strike.
The Ministers initially wished to end this change-induced dispute by accepting a modified contract from British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58% of the 37,000 primary doctors who voted opposed the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying that the British National Health Service (NHS) was currently in a vacuum, and that a slight delay would be detrimental to the interests of both employees and patients.
The new contract begins with a reference to the modification of the working practices of primary doctors overnight and weekends in order to improve care during irregular working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Junior Doctors Committee, said in a statement: "The primary doctor still has serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
It's only eight weeks before the first doctors sign the new contract. We need to make progress. We don't have much time.
BMA tries to resolve disputes through negotiation, but people are reluctant to participate and sometimes the government reacts in silence.
Despite that, just last month we got Jeremy Hunt's promise, saying that his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt now needs to act, unenforceable, to address the concerns of the primary doctor."
If he doesn't, the primary doctor makes it clear they're ready for further labor action.
The last strike, which took place at the end of April, resulted in nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 extensions of appointments, as nurses and medical doctors provided cover for doctors on the picket line.
The ministers initially wanted to end this change-induced dispute by accepting the BMA-modified contract.
BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
NHS Employers CEO Daniel Mortimer called on junior doctors to stop playing any strikes.
Mr. Mortimer said: "The labour action has had little effect, but on the contrary, it has put pressure on already dedicated teams and services, leading to fear, anxiety and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have been engaged in ongoing negotiations with the Board of Primary Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other departments, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and whistle-blowers.
Employers wish to continue to actively explore other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, other training for those who have been re-employed after a career interruption, training costs, common knowledge of the syllabus, leave for further education and gender pay differentials in the medical field - which illustrate the importance that employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health attach to the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
The officials recommended that a medication of Pound2 per day be extended to a larger number of patients and that the duration of medication be extended, after which thousands of heart patients would benefit from it.
The anticoagulant replaces the ticagrelor to reduce the risk of a heart attack.
This drug lasts 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a second heart attack.
The National Health and Clinical Optimization Institute (NICE), a regulatory agency of the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS), recommends continuous drug use for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, NHS Regulatory Body NICE recommends a continuous four-year drug for patients to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, one quarter of whom continue to suffer from repeated heart attacks or strokes.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fat matter forming specks of arteries sedimentation.
If the speck breaks, it causes a blood clot, which in turn prevents the flow of blood into the heart and causes a heart attack.
If the embolism moves, it enters the bloodstream, prevents it from flowing into the brain and causes a stroke.
He's had a heart attack. He's more likely to have another heart attack.
Made by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed for a commodity name by Briliko, Cagre will reduce the risk of morbidity by reducing the formation of blood clots.
Today's NICE draft guide recommends that patients take 90 mg for 12 months, and then three years for 60 mg and two aspirins per day.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said, "Although there is effective secondary preventive treatment, as many as a quarter of those who have had a heart attack will suffer from a repeat disease or a stroke, which usually has serious consequences."
Fear of relapse can have a very negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking Cagli with aspirin would effectively reduce the risk of repeated heart attacks and strokes for patients who have had a heart attack.
We are very pleased that the temporary recommendation for Craig will provide more treatment options for thousands of beneficiaries.
The draft guidance does not recommend the continuation of the treatment beyond this period, given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Cagre after three years, in particular the risk of haemorrhage.
Computer culture has made "election fraud" prevalent in Muslim regions.
Tower Hamlets, former mayor of Lutfur Rahman, was brutally dismissed from office last year for corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
The "political correctness" culture, which led to widespread electoral fraud in the Muslim community being ignored, is revealed today in this devastating government report.
Sir Eric Pickles, former Cabinet Minister, accused the police of turning a blind eye to the evidence of electoral abuse by the election regulatory bodies and the City Council for "exaggeration with ethnic divisions and religious issues".
The former Minister of Community Affairs, the current anti-corruption leader, said that the use of religious positions to intimidate voters had a negative impact and that the police should be allowed to set up a perimeter outside the polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggested that voters vote with their identity papers to confirm their identity.
For now, voters only have to give their names and addresses.
The report even suggested putting ink on voters' fingers to prevent a second vote.
Sir Erik said that there should be greater protection for whistleblowers.
He called for increased media access to parliamentary documents and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups ...
"It's not just to prevent electoral fraud, it's also to protect local governments from a widespread culture of corruption and financial fraud that is closely linked to it," he said.
This report was requested by Downing Street after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral tribunal ruled that the incumbent mayor, Rahman, was subject to a series of corrupt and illegal practices and was dismissed from office.
The court found that Rahman "abused the religious feelings of the Muslim community in a very ridiculous manner" and kept silent on allegations of racial discrimination and Islamophobia against him by the sword.
It is said that Rahman "declared during the campaign that it was a religious duty of the Muslims to vote for him."
As many as 300 ballot papers were suspicious, and the voters could have faked someone else's vote.
Sir Eric says there's evidence of electoral fraud all over the country.
He warned, in particular, of the fraud of the post-elections, where senior members of the Muslim community were said to have put pressure on voters to vote for the candidates they had nominated.
Sir Erik made several recommendations for the clean-up of the voting mechanism, including the inclusion of identification documents to confirm his identity.
In his report, he said: "The evidence shows that senior members, especially from Pakistan and Bangladesh background communities, put pressure on vulnerable groups in some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote according to their will."
"They fear that State institutions will turn a blind eye to such acts due to excessive sensitivity to ethnic divisions and religious `political correctness' ... "
Sir Erik put forward 50 proposals to clean up the electoral mechanism, including a strict ban on political activists from handling mailed ballot papers to prevent the "voting harvest".
The report also requires that registration information be scrutinized to prevent the electoral rolls from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
These include the requirement for voters to present their identity documents before voting.
Post-vote ink on voters' fingers to prevent a second vote.
Systematic verification of the ethnic affiliation of voters to ensure eligibility to vote.
Set three years for automatic mailing of voting requests.
Political activists and radicals are prohibited from handling completed postal ballots and mailing ballot envelopes ...
The police are authorized to set up a perimeter around the polling stations.
Amending the legal provisions to make it easier to charge persons for intimidation under the People's Representation Act 1983.
It's illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
Only English (except Wales) is allowed at polling stations.
Increased training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the rule of separate voting halls for voters.
Sir Eric denounced Metropolitan Police, saying that they had not made any criminal charges since the Tower Hamlets incident, and that was a "surprising surprise."
"Rahman and his election officer were subject to numerous corruptions and irregularities and, as a result, were disqualified by the Electoral Tribunal," he said.
According to the standards of criminal proof, he is in many ways unquestionablely guilty.
He also criticizes the municipal election registration department for being a false "check box".
Sir Erik said, "Last year the court's judgment on Tower Hamlets sounded a wake-up call."
My country has a glorious tradition of "the mother of parliament", but the secret election frauds and all the subsequent denials of certain institutions are a cause for concern and a threat to this good reputation.
At the Rio Olympics, the bikers who looked like Princess Kate and the other celebrities who ran into each other were being admired.
This week, the French biker Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who looks like Princess Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was very well received by the audience.
But this 24-year-old Olympic player is not the only gold medal contender at this summer Olympics, at least not in the social media.
So, in honour of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that appeared on the screen at the time, FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympic players who ran into Hollywood stars.
Hunters and Wolves: Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid.
In addition to Kate's face on the bike track, many netizens quickly found out that some archer was Leonardo Dicaprio's twin brother.
The American male archer Brady Ellison has caused a huge commotion in social media since his photo of Wolf of Wall Street was posted on Twitter.
In fact, the archer noticed the social media prank and admitted to being small and someone said he looked like a plum.
"I don't think it looks like it, except for the gills." Brady said to Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome dude, so I guess that's a compliment to me."
One of the most popular contrasts at the 2012 London Olympics will no doubt find more similarities this year: British remote dancer Greg Rutherford looks like a famous actor, Neil Patrick Harris.
Aliya Mustafaina, a Russian gymnastics player with big eyes that speak, has been identified as a Cuban-American singer, Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, for years, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, the lead singer of the Glee.
Reload: The user thinks Nathan Adrian is the sports page of the "Inception" actor.
Another pair of old tennis stars, Rafael Nadal, and actor Josh Hartnett, look like their eyes and lips.
The silver-picked Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova and actor Annalynne McCord have the same brown skin and blond hair, while the American team's family is compared to "the sports pageant Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Woman: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter (right) has similar faces and eyes.
Not the only one: one Twitter user was happy to find that others saw these similarities.
Dissemination theory: According to this user, there may be a reason why the pair looks like this.
A Twitter user recently happyly declared on the Internet that "the other netizens also think Hope Soro and Jennifer Carpenter look exactly the same."
Indeed, this American football star and this bloodthirsty forensic star have very similar faces and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh Jennings, whose smile is almost the same as that of the actress Laura Linney; and Gabby Douglas, a gold medal-winning gymnastics player, whose beautiful and brilliant smile and "Bring It On star" is like the smile of Gabrielle Union.
CBC, the Olympics spokesman apologized for the Chinese swimmer's comment about "slow as a pig."
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comment on 14-year-old Ajún's 4x200-metre free swim relays provoked a live viewer of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)'s Olympics.
A CBC lobbyist said that 14-year-old Chinese swimmers would "go faster than stink" in the game, and then "slow as a pig," and then the CBC was forced to apologize.
The interpreter, Byron MacDonald, at the end of the girl's 4x200-metre free swim relay final, made some observations, when he thought his microphone was off.
The audience heard that the CBC team, Byron, a reviewer with colored glasses, said, "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
It's too exciting to start swimming faster than the smell, but then it's as slow as a pig.
Thanks to her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai has a second stick, one minute, 57 seconds, 79 - the one behind Taylor Ruck in Canada, 1.61 seconds, which has led the Canadian team to narrow the gap with China.
The entire Canadian audience was shocked by this interpreter's tone and language, and they reacted to it on the Internet very quickly.
Emmett Macfarlane goes, "The CBC writer says that 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "slow as a pig"?
This idiot doesn't realize it's live.
The Chinese Xiaomei of the finals of the girls' free swim relay 4x200 meters was described as follows: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
Twitter criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly came on Twitter, and many asked him to withdraw.
When Twitter users heard that Byron McDonald was slow to react, they didn't stop.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wow, Byron MacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and all of us sound like a bunch of racists.
Shortly after, Scott Russell, the CBC radio host, apologized on the air for Byron's statement, saying, "We apologize for the comments we made on the performance of the swimmer on the air."
"We're sorry for the inappropriate wording. "
CBC apologized more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the speech.
Another interpreter, Scott Russell, also apologized for Byron.
The CBC then copied their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users protesting against what Byron said.
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We're so sorry to say that and to broadcast it.
Last night, we moved quickly to apologize to those who watched us live and those who watched us in the social media.
What needs to be said is that Byron's story is about the swimmer's performance, but not about her personally.
That means that the language is inappropriate, and Byron is very sorry about it.
Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the air, saying that his words did not mean a little physical assault and tried to justify his remarks.
"I'd like to take some time to apologize for what he said last night at the end of the women's relay race," he said on the CBC Omnibus.
"I'm just commenting on the swimmer's performance, not on his own."
"Of course, I didn't mean disrespect, and I'm sorry."
Primark, the customer expressed anger at a brazen woman who tried to wear underwear in the middle of the store.
A woman took off her underwear in the middle of a Primark store, and the customers didn't know where to look.
Worse still, she took her panties off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelf and finally put on four pairs of underwear at the Bouvererie Place mall in Folkestone.
This woman kept wearing underwear at the Primark store in the Bouverie Place mall in Folkeston and then put it back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, who was also in the store, said that after trying on her underwear, the mystery woman "dressed again, then walked out of the store and bought nothing."
She said, "Everyone can't believe what they saw."
She's standing in the middle of the store, taking a pair of panties off the shelf, taking off her tights and panties, and putting them on.
"She didn't try to find a hiding place to try it on -- she was just standing there, and it was shameless. "
"When she took off her panties again, everyone was shocked. Apparently, she was still unhappy because she put them back on the shelf."
And then she tried three more like this, and she found out she didn't like it, and then she went out of the store and dressed again.
"She doesn't seem to care about someone looking at her -- or who's gonna finally buy the underwear she tried to wear."
Ms. Davidson, who lives in Kent town, says, "The thought that someone would buy someone else's underwear that they've worn and not washed."
This happened Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "When she leaves, the shopkeeper obviously has to take down the panties, which is a good thing."
"I hate buying home a new pair of underwear, but I find another woman trying to wear it and not being washed."
A spokesperson for Primark said, "Primark has learned about what happened at our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th."
All the problematic commodities are off the shelf.
How to use Maga to protect yourself in a gun attack.
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may give you a sense of security.
We'd like to speak to the master of the Maga School of Arts in New York, Rhon Mizrachi, about how to get close to the gunman.
Whether he comes near you from the front or the back, the video will teach you how to win.
Mizrachi said that if the shooter approached you from behind, you'd first have to turn around so that you could see the attackers and "clean the fire."
Then, put a gun in your forearm and shoulder, and then hit the attacker in the face with your elbow.
Next, his groin is his knee, and when the assailant bends down because of pain, reverses the gun in his hand, hits him in the face with a barrel and a back-up gun, keeps his weapon on him.
If the shooter approaches from the front, a similar technique is used -- to keep your body out of the line of fire, to take the gun and turn it around so that the gunman doesn't fire.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the assailant in the chest, turn the gun from his grip and point it at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video and see how Mizrachi did it.
But remember, if you're not Maga Master, the safest way to get out of the robbery is to hand over the cash.
A rogue family destroyed a rental house in Soltash, Cornwall County, before being evicted.
A rogue family expelled for intimidation of its neighbours destroyed their low-cost rental housing before leaving, resulting in a loss of Pound50,000.
After a long series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and his husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were evicted from a rented house in Soltash, Cornwall County.
After being forcibly removed from the house, housing association officials were surprised to find that there had been serious damage.
The walls are full of holes, the floors are torn, the garbage is all over the floor, the walls are covered in chaos.
After being evicted, the family has been moving and is said to be living in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, the housing manager of the Cornwall County Housing Association, said she was worried that the house would be unsavory.
She said, "This is a nightmare for people living here, and I don't think people can live like this."
There are a lot of things to weigh, because this house is likely to be a bad element in Cornwall County.
The family is notorious. Their names are equally notorious.
According to the police, the family's acts of terror include fighting in the streets with baseball bats, terrorizing the surrounding population, drug addiction, drug trafficking, yelling, arguing and cursing.
In June, a 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received an antisocial behavioral resolution.
Many of the rooms in this house that may have been demolished are littered for a long time.
The floor was lifted in a room that used to trade drugs.
Neighbors say they often see them fighting in the streets, and they often call the police.
After giving them an 11-week extension to move voluntarily, the Cornwall County Housing Association forcibly removed her and her husband from the house this week.
At last, the relieved neighbours cheered for it, saying that life before was a hell of a life.
A neighbor said, "They don't care about anybody."
We've been living next door for 20 years. It's been so bad.
We've seen the cops come to the door on countless occasions.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep."
We're up early because it's too quiet here -- we're not used to it!
They're finally gone. That's great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the community executive of the Cornwall County Housing Association, said the family had failed to cooperate with the local government.
The family has lived in this house for 20 years. The police often visit.
Garbage and old toys are being left on the side of this low-rent weed.
He added: "It is regrettable that the tenant did not bear any responsibility for her and her family ' s actions, and that eviction was the last thought of the Cornwall County Housing Association. "
It's a very difficult case because they behave very extreme, and they do things that must scare the neighbors.
I thank my team for their work, as well as the Devon and Cornwall Police and the community members who bravely provided us with information.
I hope this will bring some comfort to the neighbors and send a message that we will not tolerate antisocial behavior.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said that their three sons lived in this house at different times, but also that they were in their 20s.
After they were removed, a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms.
The housing association workers will soon be cleaning up all the garbage around the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found 70 grams of marijuana, as well as scales, drugs and £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of B-type drugs and for drug trafficking intent.
She claims that the money was used to buy tombstones for Lee Skeldon, the son who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is known that after being homeless Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in this house are covered with graffiti.
According to the police, they will expel tenants who disobey the Tenant Rule.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall County Police said that the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to defy the Tenant Rule.
"This warning is directed at those who think that their actions will not be blamed, and those who have been devastated by them," she said.
Devon and Cornwall County Police will not tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour, and will continue to work with partners to protect our community.
Reed: The elected President of Hilary will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court
Senator Harry Reid, leader of the Democratic Party of the Senate, said he was convinced that if the Democratic Party presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, was elected president, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senator Republicans have been blocking the confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
The leader of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnell, said that the next president would choose him to replace the late Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at a telephone conference on Thursday that he predicted Hilary would choose Garland with "some credibility."
Reed's female spokesperson then said that Reed didn't talk directly to Hilary about whether or not to nominate Garland, and that he was just guessing.
He admired Garland and said that Hilary's team didn't want to spoil it for the new candidate.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States District of Columbia Federal Circuit Court of Appeal.
Reed said that the Republicans who stopped Garland's nomination were the "principal" and "achiever" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit to be president.
"Treats": Naked calendars, both men and women love it.
"Treats" will be working with photographer David Bellemere on a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to find a new generation of top models for their 2017 NUuses calendar, not famous nudists.
Steve Shaw, the president of "Treats" said earlier this year that their magazine, dominated by nudity, was different from the old-fashioned "player," because "the latter was male-oriented."
And we're looking at women.
Apparently, he thought the calendar was the same.
"We need to show the eternal and classic nudity that makes women and men feel comfortable, and this is what we're inspired by." Shaw said at a calendar launch.
Women will be happy to participate in this film because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online, and they can personally go to public recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Video reports show that small sleeping sharks are the longest-lived vertebrates.

Julius Nielsen, who had been studying sharks, said that it had been documented that a female head sleeping shark was expected to be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres old.
The French courts rejected the petition to dismantle the shops in the jungle refugee camp.
A French court rejected a petition by the Galay government to dismantle dozens of temporarily built shops and restaurants in the "circle" refugee camp, where thousands of refugees are currently living.
At this week's hearing before the Court, the Garrett Government argued that the French Government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops in the camp where people sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy beverages, provide hairdressing services, and sell tea at 50 cents (40 pence) or basic meals at several euros in a temporary restaurant.
The Governor ' s Office of Galle believes that these sites should be dismantled because of the parallel economy of non-tax payments and the existence of fire and health hazards.
However, the humanitarian community has indicated to the Court that these shops and restaurants are extremely important because the free food provided by State-sponsored associations and other groups is simply not sufficient to meet the needs of the growing refugee population in the camp ...
They claim that these temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A Ryer court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the owners of the 72 temporary shops, but said that Governor Galay's fears were "explicable".
According to Judge Jean François Molla, these grocery stores, cafés and restaurants are much more than simply feeding refugees who live in extremely dangerous conditions.
He said that these places were a peaceful convergence between refugees and volunteers.
One of the locations threatened with demolition was the "Jungle Book Kids" café in the camp, which provides 200 meals per day, English and French lessons and offers asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was written that the closure of this café would be a catastrophe for these children, many of whom are only eight years old. "
Two charitable organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, predict that the number of refugees in the bush camps has surpassed 9,000 on Friday, the highest level since the summer surge.
"This $5,000 grant is a relief to my immediate needs. "
Xiao Fen, a poor girl from the village of Mi-ho, was admitted to the University of South China.
On August 9th, when she was upset about the school fees, the Committee gave her a grant of $5,000 in time.
For more than 690 students living in poverty, the county authorities have also implemented a grant of 2.83 million yuan for school attendance.
At the same time, in cases where the economic situation of the family is particularly difficult, assistance is provided in the form of social contributions to study, etc.
This year, Hana-chan consolidated over $18.5 million in student grants and raised more than $2.5 million from the financial sector to include poor students in the real bank card within the prescribed time frame.
She was grateful to say, "I thought my father was dead and my brother and I couldn't go to college, and I didn't expect the county to solve our problems in time."
As at 8 August, Hana-chan had secured over $21 million in assistance to 1,140 needy students in the first half of the year.
All needy students in the county have achieved the necessary assistance, which is supplemented.

According to Xinhua, the New South Wales Government of Australia announced on 11th that $200 million (approximately $154 million) would be spent on the largest renovation of the famous Sydney Opera Theatre since its inception.
The New South Wales government has indicated that this renovation will not change the shape of the opera shell.
The Sydney Opera is one of Sydney ' s landmark buildings, designed by Danish architect Jon Utsson, which was built in 1973 and hosts about 8 million visitors per year.
Rory Jeffs, the general manager of the Sydney Symphony, thinks that the Sydney Opera will use this to turn the battle into one of the most effective concert halls in the world.
Non-King citizens who have lived in Kyoto for more than six months and who meet the conditions of legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence, and who are eligible for continuous schooling may apply for a residence permit.
Recently, the regulations for the implementation of the temporary residence permit regulations in Beijing have been introduced, which means that the temporary residence permit will be upgraded to a residence permit.
According to the head of the department concerned, the shift from a "temporary residence permit" to a "resident permit" meant that Beijing would switch from a "managership" to a "managerial service" for non-King residents.
Journalists today learned from the National Revenue Authority that, by the end of June this year, tax authorities had published 2,470 "blacklists" of tax offences.
It is understood that in July 2014, the National Tax Administration took a step forward in the central government functions by publishing, in conjunction with the Tax Credit Management Scheme, the "Investment of information on major tax offences".
However, the facts of the violations, the legal basis for dealing with the penalties in these cases are published and the basic information of the offenders and the persons responsible for the relevant intermediaries are disclosed together with "blacklists".
Quality checks, finance, customs and other government departments have also taken appropriate disciplinary measures against "blacklists".

"Environmental problems manifest themselves in the atmosphere, in water, in soil pollution, but in the production of ways of life."
For example, in 2015, Jiangsu Province had 21 per cent land development, the highest in the country ' s provinces and autonomous regions.
As a result, the problem of high pollution, large energy sources and large landholdings has not yet been fundamentally addressed in terms of a shift from productive lifestyles.
On the one hand, in the light of the results of the creation of various ecological environments at all levels in Jiangsu province, the absolute advantage is paramount in the country; on the other hand, the resource environment is under great pressure.
A solid advance in ecological environmental protection and governance requires a fundamental move towards a transformation of productive lifestyles and the building of ecological civilization for transformation for the benefit of the people ...

Qingdao is the country's 12th pilot city in Shandong province for the purpose of remunerative use and trading of sewage rights.
On 11th, each enterprise went to the Qingdao City Sewerage Trading Centre to submit a claim for sewage rights, which will be followed by payment of a fee for use.
The first list of transactions to be completed also presages the official launch of the Qingdao Stewardship Pilot, which will be the first in the province and the first in the country's city-level Stewardship Trade.
At 11 a.m., Zhao Su-ping, General Manager of Twin Peaches Chemical (Group) Ltd., came to the City of Qingdao's Decontamination and Drainage Trading Center to submit a claim for the right to decontamination.
The company, located in the Old City district of Qingdao, was completely shut down at the end of last year and moved environmentally to the new plant area of Pingdu.
After Zhao Xuping submitted the application form, building the project ' s environmental impact report and so on, the Qingdao City Decontamination Rights Storage and Trading Service Centre began the initial examination of the application.
Based on the prices of Qingdao City, the collection criteria set by the financial and other sectors, the initial estimate for the use of the sewage rights is currently estimated at approximately $642,200, and the staff member will complete the approval within seven working days.
The first list of transactions to be completed foreshadows the formal opening of the Qingdao Drainage Trading Pilot and will also be the first in the province and the first in the country's city-level Stewardship Trade.
According to Zhao Su-ping, the corporate environment is now invested in 400 million dollars, apparently huge, but it has a significant impact on business management concepts, social benefits and space for innovation management.
On the same day, Qingjio Qingjio Shinzhengsaka Motors and Parts Co., Inc., also requested the right to remove the sewage from the 4200 high-iron and interior fittings items produced every year.
The project is a mechanical processor, with an application for initial sewage rights of 0.514 tonnes/year for chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 0.052 tonnes/year for ammonia (NOX).
The right to air pollution is used and traded on a reimbursable basis for electricity throughout the city, and the production of heat supplies priority industrial enterprises.
Existing EVA sewage units acquired by 1 January 2016 are not subject to reimbursable user fees.
" Remunerative access to sewage does not amount to the acquisition of illegal sewage powers and does not release pollutants at will ... "
Qingdao City Environmental Protection Agency Deputy Director Han Hongyan explained that if illegal sewage is still punishable under the relevant regulations, it is not possible to allow illegal businesses to avoid punishment by purchasing sewage rights.
In other words, the legal means of combating environmental offences and imposing severe penalties on companies for excess-marked sewage, thereby protecting the environment and protecting public health ...
Businesses now, for their own benefit, have increased incentives to treat pollution, valued limited rights to discharge and reduced pollutant emissions.
Driven by economic benefits, the reduction of pollutant emissions has been transformed from a coercive act by the Government to a conscious market act by the enterprise, which truly serves the purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature and safeguarding public health.
The right to discharge, also known as "emission rights", is the right to emit pollutants, which refers to the legal right of emitters to release pollutants into the environment within the limits allocated by the Government.
This right is essentially the right of the polluter to occupy, use and reap the benefits of the resources of the environmental capacity ...
The next step is to transfer discharges through currency exchange between internal sources, provided that total pollutant emissions do not exceed permitted emissions.
Since 1968, when the deal was initiated by American economist Dales, the United States applied it in the 1970s to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources.
We have been piloting since 2007 and are now fully operational in 14 provinces (districts, municipalities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, in order to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out an aerial strike against the targets of the Islamic State in Syria, several Russian warplanes have taken up air support from the Syrian Hemeim airbase.
On 22 February of this year, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the parties to the Syrian conflict, which has been in effect since 27 of that year.
According to the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations designated by the UN Security Council, such as the Islamic State's Support Front.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of the Russian military will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if extremist forces were not attacked, they would spread to Russia.
Although Russia and the West have not reached an agreement on joint efforts to combat Syrian extremist forces, Russia will strengthen its cooperation in this regard with Syria, Iran, Iraq, etc.
In September 2015, at the invitation of the Syrian Government, Russia began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces ...
On 15 March of this year, the withdrawal of the main Russian military forces in Syria began, but the Russian side promised to maintain its airbase in Hemimem and its naval base in Tartus.

There are no fixed patterns of rural development, but it is difficult to make spontaneous changes in the countryside, and the most important thing is to get the right people to the village.
The Songjiang District Department in Shanghai recently used electronic police to fix drivers to play with their cell phones. More than 30 cases were detected in a week.
As smartphones become more and more fun, tweeting, tweeting and even playing games, shopping for treasures becomes the norm, and many people seem to have to walk away from their phones, and they can't even stop driving.
The Road Traffic Safety Act specifically prohibits driving mobile phones and defines it as obstructing safe driving.
Unfortunately, this phenomenon has not been adequately punished, due to, inter alia, the presence of lawbreakers and the difficulty of obtaining evidence, and the legal provisions have almost become the norm.
If the authorities are determined to declare war on their mobile phones, and to regularize this measure, the violation will be contained.

Village Secretary Su Chifan: The land area per capita is increasing each year, starting with 50 acres, and now exceeds 100 acres; the average yield is increasing each year and there is room for income growth for working farmers.
Quantified shares to every villager, the greatest highlight of the economic reform of the rural sub-Saharan economies is the clarity of the property rights of the rural collectives and the exploration of the separation of the political process.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations in the rural town of Siem An Town in Si Si City were "distributed" with their village councils, which perform the management of rural public affairs, while the cooperative organizations are mainly active in the business.
The two institutions have two accounts, and they don't "get together" to prevent the corruption of village cadres involved in collective asset management.
The Deputy Director of the Rural Committee of Jiangsu Province, H.E. Paul Ping, said that Jiangsu ' s next steps would continue to promote community partnership reform, encourage farmers to develop jointly and establish mechanisms for the democratic functioning of power at the village level.
To Bien: To move forward with reforms, community equity partnerships, quantification of assets to members, anchoring to farmers, and clear property rights.
Through the Internet+, the implementation of his right to know, to participate in decision-making and to supervise democratic governance, the three rights are given to farmers, and they are indeed translated into a functioning mechanism of regulated equity cooperation.
At present, the country ' s new rural collective economy is dominated by asset leasing, business share, agricultural development, and joint development of four development models.
It is known that the overseas fairs have become an important platform for building the Zhejiang province "a way."
The successful organization of these overseas fairs has generated valuable experience and a good basis for continuing to open up emerging markets along the "one-way" route, building an integrated platform for overseas fairs.
Pike will always be guided by the need to raise the demand for sports among consumers, build a sports industry biosphere and accelerate the strategic upgrading from a single sporting goods manufacturing enterprise to a professional sports service enterprise.
Hamir added that 34 others had been taken to hospital, including 3 firemen who had been lightly wounded and released from hospital.
He also appealed to the residents of the fire apartment to contact the authorities, as some of the occupants were still unaccounted for.
According to the information received, Ms. Mariana Turay, who lived in this apartment for 30 years, said, "It seems that a bomb fell."
According to the information received, the local fire department took one hour and 45 minutes to put out the fire and residents of nearby buildings were allowed to return to their homes after a few hours.

Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "Beautiful hand" has been "reversed" in his career on the road to shooting.
Chang Donghong, from Dong Hong Village, Xiamen, replaced his home's 29-inch old TV with a 65-inch big TV.
The daughter of a common farmer, Zhang Binbin, who won the silver medal for the 50-metre female rifle of the Rio Olympics in China on the night of 11th.
On the night of the 11th, just before this new TV, the Chang Donghong couple and dozens of relatives and friends witnessed the amazing process of getting their daughter up and running from almost pre-game to almost reversal.
During that day's game, Zhang Binbin once came down the middle and seemed to be far from the finals.
But parents and family and friends didn't give up, they kept brushing the text live, and they saw that with the other players out there, Zhang Binbin was raised, eventually locked in the finals, and there was a cheer at home.
In the finals, when Zhang Binbin was one step behind the ranking, the last few shots became more secure, winning silver medals with only 0.2 ring marks.
This year, 27-year-old Zhang Binbin, in his 16-year-old shooting career, almost passed through this hard-earned silver medal.
Her mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told reporters that when they were hesitating, Zhang Binbin came to a few novelists from his village.
These novelists were the same village kids who were also recommended for training, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin took the initiative to go back to Shang An school for reasons such as family difficulties.
But after his enlightenment coach, Zhang Ajay, he went back to the Xiamen.
And after entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once returned home because he was too late to enter the national team, for a time when there was no hope.
This time, not only Coach Zhang Yaji, the head and coach of the Xiamen Shooting Arrow Center and Fujian Province team came to the house and eventually persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the province.
Just like yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl's insistence on a reversal of the shooting path.
"The way in which each coach chooses his team is different, when I see Binbin's hands are pretty, and then I just hit each other."
Zhang Donghong also recalled that, in the training tests, the number of rings produced by her daughter, although not the best, was stable, and that was one of the important reasons why Zhang Binbin attracted coaches.
In training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yaji was most impressed by the input of this peasant girl.
He recalled that more than a year after his entry into the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a standing-up shooting exercise and demanded that the team not move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter had always been a quiet, sweet child, who had always loved drawings and homemade hand-made toys since childhood.
"I used to make clothes at home, stitches and patches, and Binbin picks up some edges to make his own doll."
She said that her daughter often sews her own handmade toys, and that she's good at drawing, from the five officers of the doll to the dress, and she always does well.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family get together so much that they can only go home on holidays, often by telephone.
Parents say that whether we meet or call, Zhang Binbin rarely talks about his own hard work, more about having fun with his parents.
You don't usually see your daughter, and your parents keep her drawings at home as a child, as well as the honors of the years.
Xiaolong showed her cartoons to reporters, "If she wasn't a shooter, she'd still be drawing."
And in the second floor living room of the Zhang Binbin family, there was a cabinet full of medals, medals and certificates she had won.
Zhang Donghong put the medals and medals together, and the certificates were put together in the folders, "These are the honors of more than a decade, and we all cherish them."
In recent days, the Xiao Xiao Xiao Foundation of Hebei Province has sent $16,000 in condolence money to the families of six families in the village of Kui Quan.
This is yet another act of compassion that the Fund has sent out to society in search of lost children and lonely old people in the 7.19 flood.

A good man, Iron, who died to help the district with its compulsory drainage, left behind two-year-old children and a wife with six nails, and a good man, Iron, touched the whole town.
On August 4th, Hwangbei's Tzu Xiao Foundation staff and Hebei's brand volunteers came to the good old Iron family and paid $3,200 in love to the old Iron family.
When the vice president of the brand association, Yelly, learned about the situation of the "old iron" family, he decided to start a "love sale" campaign among the company members of the brand club to help the "old iron" family get along.
Hebei Province Xiao Xiao Foundation, known as Hebei Province Voluntary Service Foundation, Tzu Xiao Foundation, initiated by Hebei Branding Committee, established in August 2015.
On August 12, Hong Kong's "Oriental Daily" reported that there are three major problems with the sale of diamonds in the interior, including a net increase in the price of false diamonds, the weight of false diamonds, and the lack of security after sale.
And Antwerp is one of the largest diamond trading centres in the world, and the local craftsmen's diamond cutting techniques are well known, and the diamonds sold are highly authenticated and very popular with the Mainland lady.
"A little bag, holding hands, a small handful, worth nearly a million dollars, a Lao mother who bought diamonds, described her experience in Antwerp in June this year to the Mainland media.
She said she hid the diamonds in her underwear, went to the bathroom for days, took the showers, and slept tight on her feet.
She claims that diamonds bought in Antwerp are worth about $55,000 per carat, and diamonds of the same quality are sold at around $111,000 in Xiamen.
She sold all the diamonds she bought at 20% of the purchase price, making over $200,000 at a time.
According to Mainland Customs, diamonds are not goods or necessities for passengers in their journeys and are therefore goods in the category of goods that are subject to declaration at the time of entry or exit, or are listed as smuggling, and are severely liable to imprisonment.
According to external sources, on 10 local time, the British Prime Minister's Office, Downing Street, announced that British Prime Minister Teresa May would spend the summer in Switzerland, but did not disclose the exact place of the holiday.
According to the media, after the British referendum, the new British Prime Minister chose "neutral" Switzerland on the European continent for a holiday with some kind of symbolic policy.
The British Guardian commented that the symbol represented by the neutral State of Switzerland played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister's first resort.
According to the British Daily Telegraph, Teresa May chose Switzerland for the first time since Mrs. Thatcher.
The choice of two women prime ministers contrasted with the preference of Blair and Cameron for vacations in hot spots.
It is known that the new British Prime Minister, Teresa May, will return to London on August 24th and await her a series of important tasks and activities.
The British Parliament will resume on 5 September, and the debate will include a request for a second Trans-European referendum on the Internet.
The British referendum on June 23 decided to de-escalate, but the new British Prime Minister did not wish to activate paragraph 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of the year.
There are 1325 intangible cultural heritage projects in the city of Huangshan, both of which are the province's first in variety and in number.
Because the cultural non-genetic heritage of the emblem is largely dependent on oral reproduction, many of the non-receipts are on the verge of being lost and the use of digital technology to preserve and protect them is imperative.
In accordance with the main elements of the work of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to hear the consideration of specific reports on its work and to conduct a thematic inquiry on the implementation of the Banking Supervision and Management Act to serve local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research teams to conduct research in selected municipalities in preparation for thematic inquiries.
According to Han Jianhui, for the first time in my province, the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress, which has heard, considered and conducted ad hoc reports on the work of vertical management, is an active exploration to strengthen and expand its oversight work.
In Xinjiang Qash, the Commanding Department of Exercises, with the orders of the Director-General, the Carabineros in Kash, and the Tata, the troops in the Aksu region quickly proceeded to conduct a mobile regroupment, in accordance with the commanding instructions, and to proceed to the battle zone.
China's Mars program is here.
Our Mars mission is going to be rounded up, landed, patrolled at once, and it's never been done abroad.
The goal of our Mars exploration launch is to go around, land, patrol. This mission is quite difficult.
Because Mars exploration takes 26 months to meet a window of time, experts are working closely on a project to launch our first Mars probe in 2020.
According to Xu Da Chul, although our aircraft have entered deep space, the completion of Mars exploration remains indispensable, and Mars exploration means that China is entering the age of deep space exploration in the true sense of the word.
"Only every two or three years does Mars have the closest opportunity to Earth to launch a Mars detector at this point in time, which is the most energy-efficient for a launch vehicle... "
" Considering the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be carried out by our Long March 5 carrier rocket... "
Our Mars mission is about to be rounded, landed, patrolled at once. This is a form that has never been seen in a foreign country, where it was planned to be rounded and landed, but the landing failed.
Mars exploration involves a wide range of technical areas, especially since, while the Mars vehicle is a space detector, it has a distinct character in comparison to the general space detector.
In other words, the Mars probe must have the ability to determine the route and detect the hazard of the obstacle.
Researcher Pan Kihoho of the China Space Science and Technology Group V said that humans are so interested in Mars exploration because of its scientific, technological and other importance and even its relevance to the future of mankind.
Mars is now the planet with the highest level of human research except on Earth, and the history of human exploration using space detectors runs almost throughout the history of human space.
Human beings therefore hope that one day they will build a living base on Mars and eventually migrate to Mars and turn it into a second home for mankind.
There are also numerous indications that Mars, like the current Earth, was likely to have evolved over billions of years into thin atmospheres, low temperatures and depleted water sources.
As a result, research into the detection or manned landing on Mars can be advanced in order to prevent the Earth from becoming the second Mars where humans are unable to survive.
As of June 2016, 114 lunar surveys and 43 Mars surveys had been conducted worldwide.
However, from the 1990s to the present, there have been 18 Mars expeditions, whereas only 14 have been detected on the Moon.
There are currently five Mars orbital vehicles and two Mars cruisers, but only one month of orbiter and one month of landing vehicle are working.
The world's space-faring nations have developed exploration programmes targeting the Mars system, which means that today's Martian exploration is more hot than the Moon.
On 5 November 2013, India launched the first Mars probe, Mangarian, as the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
Mangarian is used to study the surface of Mars, the atmosphere and mineral characteristics, and to find out if there are signs of methane and life on Mars.
The hardest part of this mission is that the probe enters the atmosphere on Mars with only one chance of aerodynamic and parachute deceleration.
According to Sun Zechua, the Master Designer of the Mars Explorer at the Central Department of the China Space Science and Technology Corporation, Mars exploration missions face many technical challenges.
Mars has very low atmospheric pressure, with only 1% of atmospheric pressure on the Earth ' s surface and high uncertainty.
Scientists don't have a thorough understanding of what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about, what it's about.
Mars often forms dust storms similar to the Earth's dust weather during the summer, which causes the solar light energy received by the Mars vehicle to decline dramatically and must be designed as a "slept" mode to allow it to wait patiently for the dust to pass.
At the same time, the Mars atmosphere has also reduced its impact on solar light, which poses a challenge to the energy supply of Mars exploration.
This requires a larger solar wing of the probe, which needs to be constantly adjusted and directed towards the sun.
Also, the surface gravity of Mars is only 38% of the Earth, but it's much more than the surface of the moon, so the probe needs more power.
"The most central and difficult part of this Mars mission is the process of aerodynamic appearance and parachute deceleration after the probe enters the atmosphere of Mars. There is only one opportunity to ensure success... "
Sunzawa said that because of the distance between the Earth and Mars, the entire process could not be controlled in real time by the ground, and it had to be done on its own by the probe.
Without so many propellants to offset that high speed, the speed of landing on Mars depends on the atmosphere of Mars, which is difficult to simulate on the ground.
Pang Chi-ho said that, in general, Mars is detected in a manner similar to that of the Moon, and it's also "round, fall, cruise, return" that eventually achieves the goal of human landing on Mars.
As Mars is much farther from Earth than the Moon, the detection of Mars requires a series of more complex technical difficulties.
According to the Taiwan media, the president of the station, Lin Qin, announced yesterday morning that the regulations governing the improper acquisition of property by political parties and their affiliated organizations have been in effect since today.
The Vice President of the National Party, Jan Qingxian, said, "A more than a hundred-year-old Nationalist Party, with the commitment and responsibility of society, will not collapse this way."
Lin Bing stressed that if a political party, a subordinate organization or a trustee, among others, violates the prohibitions laid down in the regulations, the committee will investigate ex officio and "statutory" the sanctions and impose a penalty.
Lin has also announced that the Vice-President of the ICAC will be the Vice-Director of the ICAC, Hung Bacon.
He said that the Chairman of the Improper Party Committee was no longer a candidate, drawing on the experience of Hong Beagan in past investigations of related major cases, which would serve as a basis for the Committee ' s identification of related cases of improper party production.
Gen Qingxian thinks that if there's still a party today, no one's going to give you a social donation, and if the whole party is confiscated, the National Party can just ask for social support and sponsorship, "There's really no way to get it today."
Jin Qihyun also stressed that, even if the KNP party had not been completely confiscated and confiscated after the party regulations had gone astray, the rest would still be donated as promised, the party would be given zero, and the party would want everything to start from scratch.
Original title: "Columni of the corridor" Langan Peak v. Tribute host Wang Zhian's honour violation case
The rule of law evening news reporter Wang Zhian, who published a statement on Xinwa Weibo about the corridor doctor, has brought Wang Zhian and Beijing MicroDreams Network Technology Ltd. to court.
Yesterday afternoon, the Heineken Court handed down its judgment in the case, finding that Wang Zhian and Micro-Mine did not constitute a violation and dismissed all the claims in the Landing case.
At the beginning of 2014, a survey of journalist Wang Zhian found that, despite 600 days in the hospital corridor where the Randal Peak was shaped by the media as a sad hero under institutional pressure, there was a lot of false information about these reports.
On March 29, 2014, the corridor doctor programme, produced by the Google News Survey, was broadcast.
There is no evidence to support all the so-called excessive medical information reported to the media by the Lantern.
Wang Zhian is also in the authenticated microblogging, describing the fact that "it's through nature, with obvious paranoia, and so on."
Randal requested Wang Zhian to remove Weibo, apologize to him and compensate him for the moral damage of $100,000.
During the trial, the parties argued whether Wang Zhian had violated the right to honour of the Lantern.
Look at the 12th: The track opening Chinese team is busy with girls rushing on four bikes looking forward to breaking through.
The bike is expected to make the Olympic gold "Zero Break," and the girls will challenge the two world champions, the German team, and look forward to a cooling-up.
Wang Town has been in a prominent state for the last two seasons, with a silver medal in last year's Beijing Athletics World Cup, and a new personal project champion in May this year's World Cup competition.
According to the foreign media, 27-year-old Korean archer, Zhang Hui-jin, won gold medals in the female archery competition, followed by an Olympic gold medal and became a double champion.
Zhang Hye-jin, who was considered to be a very late-coming contestant, regretted not having a ticket to the last London Olympics, is now proud to stand on the highest stage of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Hue-jin won a gold medal in the finals of the female archery competition at the Samba Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, against Lisa On-ru of Germany at a total of 6-2 points.
She didn't shoot for the first time in the fourth grade until she was 27 years old and won the first personal medal in the World Cup in 2014, a late-known player.
Zhang Hye-jin recalled, "Before attending high school, there was no level enough to be able to compete in the national race.
Zhang Hye-jin won only 4th place in the London Olympics competition four years ago, and lost the tickets to the Olympics and only watched his colleague and best friend, Chi-Phi, take two gold medals.
Zhang Hye-jin talked about her gold-digging speech after the female archery award ceremony. "Until the end, he shot as many arrows as he could, probably with good results and satisfaction.
The 28-year-old Korean archer "Sister One", the individual archer of the London Olympics, Chevby, won the bronze medal.
Chivbe lost to Jang Hue-jin in the semi-finals and fought for the bronze medal against the Mexican contestant Alexandra Valencia.
Kifbe is making sure that the battleground is covered with tears from the back of the bronze medals.
First, the coaches have accumulated a wealth of experience in their ongoing research, and secondly, the way science is trained, which needs to be built up over the long term.
Artillery training, night crossing through graveyards, etc., helps the crew to focus and remain normal.
Although not confirmed yet, many sources have indicated that the Apple launch in the fall of 2016 will take place in September and that iPhone7 is coming.
Although Apple didn't respond, the new iPhone feature has been configured and posted, and even online, the iPhone7 "real machine model" picture.
The new generation of iPhones is called "the eyes of the crowd", hot, tight, rich... if you want to buy the real thing the first time, you have to choose a good channel, for example, Sunin.
This adds to people's disappointment with the new phone, "It's longer, but it can't project holograms! This generation of iPhones is terrible."
The iPhone7 is like the other iPhones, with countless secrets before birth.
In addition, several sources claim that a new generation of iPhones will cancel 3.5 mm headphone interfaces and switch to bluetooth connections and charging interfaces, which will provide space for apples to add a second speaker.
Another piece of evidence to support this information is that apples allowed headphone manufacturers to produce headphone products connected by charging interfaces as early as 2014.
These messages are true or false, and the answer will not be revealed until the Apple will be released in the fall of 2016.
But this does not prevent industry from looking at the prospect of iPhone7 -- many believe that iPhone7 is likely to be the last major upgrade of Apple to iPhone.
Although the market share of iPhone has declined, according to data released recently by IDC, the market research institute.
In this case, Goldman Sachs kept Apple stock on a "buy-in" rating, while BMO analysts thought that iPhone7 would reap a historic sales score.
At the same time, the company CEO Hock Tan has indicated that the future increase in apple harvests is likely to exceed 20 per cent, thanks entirely to the introduction of iPhone7.
7% of the respondents indicated that they had plans to buy iPhone7, compared to 4% of those who planned to buy iPhone6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20 per cent of the user groups currently holding iPhone6 or 6Plus are planning to buy iPhone7, which is a significant proportion.
And second, there's expert analysis that most of the fruit powder likes to replace its iPhone in the next generation.
According to statistics, about 26 per cent of all iPhone users have not changed their cell phones for two years, iPhones, which has almost 120 million users for two years.
According to the media, during the production of iPhone7, Taiwan was hit by several earthquakes, "the power production facilities on the station were damaged beyond imagination and could have had an impact on the initial supply of iPhone 7. "
The supply-demand paradox affects ordinary users, and it's time to choose a good channel for the first low price iPhone 7.
According to the sources, Suening's high-level meetings with Apple have been taking place in the near future to prepare for a full supply.
Operators have negotiated with Suning and it is foreseen that, as the parties work together in depth, they will inevitably bring lower prices and more caring services to the users.
"The lowest price, the consumer may be "seven dollars a day to buy the iPhone7'."
There's plenty of goods and a variety of concessions to stop buying iPhone7 from "pressure mountain," and Sunning's logistics will turn this beauty into a more intuitive experience.
Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suninger, your iPhone 7 is here."

The park is made up of more than 100 small circular ponds, with about 300 species of ornamental flowers, sleeping Lotuss, etc.
The rural flower industry has become a bright spot for new rural development in the country, with both its appreciation and its leisure and economic benefits.
According to external sources, the Rio Olympic "Green Pool" has been a subject of concern in recent days because of the shift from blue to green.
However, in the morning of the 10th day, the pool of the pool next to the diving pool also turned green.
The Australian waterball player showed that his eyes were sore and he wanted to shed tears.
Prior to that, the official Rio Olympics confirmed that the pool had turned green and said that the coloring of the pool was due to weak alkaline and did not affect the health of athletes.
But Australian athletes, after winning a race with the Japanese team at the pool, said that their eyes were sore.
The first time after the pool became green, the competition organizers worked late on 9th night to deal with the diving pool, but the color of the pool quickly changed in the morning of the 10th day.
During the Australian and Japanese games, environmental conditions deteriorated in the pool, but officials stressed that they would restore the water quality of the two pools to their original colours on 11th.
The spokesman for the Rio Olympics, Mario Andrada, said, "Today afternoon, the level of alkaline in the diving pool was first weakened."
"We are aware of a range of possible causes for the coloring of the pool, as well as the alkali content of the water quality ... "
The water quality has been tested in a series of water quality tests carried out by the Aquatic Sports Centre, and hundreds of divers and swimmers have used pools to determine that water quality conditions meet standards ... "
"We've been following normal procedures these days, but we may have overlooked the effect that more athletes could have on water quality... "
"But a change in the colour of water certainly has no effect on health, especially on athletes..."
" This independent team confirmed our assessment and the measures we took to restore the pool to normal colour and chemical state... "
"We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the rate of recovery was affected by the rain."
According to the Taiwan Central Service, a prison on the outskirts of Metro Manila was bombed last night, injuring the warden and killing 10 prisoners, including two Chinese.

The Urumqi Travel Agency, which regulates the operational order of the tourist dispersed market, must sign contracts with tourists
Xinjiang has entered the tourist season to regulate the operating order of the tourists ' market. The Urumqi City Tourism Enforcement Branch, in conjunction with the Municipal Transportation Authority ' s Enforcement Branch, conducted a survey yesterday on the irregularity of the travel vehicles in the dispersed market, and the low rate of contracts between travel agencies and tourists.
Yesterday morning at 8 a.m., around the Cabinsky Hotel, there were about 10 buses full of tourists, most of which were on a daily tour to the Tianli.
"Hello, I'm from the Urumqi Tourist Board. Have you signed a contract with this travel agency?"
Urumqi's law enforcement division staff introduced U. U. U. U. U. U. U.: "The excursion bus and the shuttle bus run the tourist passenger project in Urumqi market and are not qualified to do so. "
"A fine of between three hundred thousand and one hundred thousand dollars for overextended operations, and a fine of 2,000 dollars for the driver ' s lack of qualification. "
It is known that previously, Urumqi's tourist law enforcement authorities had inspected the west park, Red Mountain, and other areas where tourists were concentrated.
In combination with the two inspections, Markie, Deputy Chief of the Tourism Enforcement Branch of Urumqi City, said, "First is safety, second is regulation, tourist vehicles are fine, and if there's a problem, they'll all be injured."
" We are jointly and continuously inspecting the market to regulate the use of vehicles by travel agents to ensure the safety of tourists... "
On the morning of 12 August, the Press Office of the State Council held a press conference on the functioning of the national economy in July 2016.
The head of the Department for Integrated Statistics of the National Economy, the press spokesman for the National Statistical Office, Sein, said that, in July, the rate of growth of indicators in the national economy had slowed, but it was still operating in reasonable areas.
Data released by the National Statistical Office show that in July there was an increase in fixed asset investment and a fall in data such as total imports.
Sheng came to say that, with regard to the performance of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow the Prime Minister's saying, "It's volatile, it's still good," which gives a better overview of the characteristics of the economic performance in July.
He explained that "inflexibility" meant that some of the economic indicators in July had actually fallen back.
Export pressure is still high because the domestic and foreign economies are still undergoing deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and the world economy is not recovering as expected.
Domestically, the economy as a whole is still at a critical stage of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is unleashing and the economy is under considerable downward pressure, so some indicators are somewhat volatile.
In July there was also a special case, the floods were more severe, and the heat and heat of the summer had some impact on production operations in some areas.
According to a recent release from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people throughout the country were affected, with direct economic losses exceeding 200 billion yuan.
In terms of industry, investment, transport-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees.
The weekly freight transhipment in July increased at a rate of 3.6 percentage points over the previous month, and the floods had some impact on traffic in these areas.
In view of these factors, it is also normal and expected that some of the indicators will fluctuate in July.
He said that the word "good" meant that, despite a drop in the economic growth rate, the economy was generally stable, steady and steady, and the positive trend remained unchanged.
In July, the CPI rose by 1.8 per cent and the ring rose by 0.2 per cent; in January-July, the CPI rose by 2.1 per cent, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to the Chongqing Meteorological Department portal, high temperatures in all districts and districts are covered by various levels of heat allowance in all parts of the city, except for Xiaoyang.
At least 28 provinces across the country have defined the criteria for the payment of benefits, although the criteria vary from one province to another, while Chongqing receives the high temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance.
Up to 37°C per person per day for a period of not less than 10 yuan per day and above 37°C per person per day for a period of not less than 15 yuan per day.
High-temperature workers above 40°C are entitled to a maximum allowance of $20 per day per month (except in cases where the worker is already legally entitled to a high-temperature job allowance).
According to this standard, Kaiju, which received the highest number of days in heat last month, received $330 and the lowest number of days in the city entrance, 80, while the highest temperature in Xiaoyang, which did not meet the high temperature standard, did not receive the high temperature allowance.
In the past, a lot of units used to use cool drinks to offset the high temperature allowance, and the City Security Bureau said that this was not the way it was.
The employer may not deduct or lower the wages of the worker if the work is suspended due to the heat of the day and the working hours are shortened.
According to the City Affairs Bureau, employees who work at high temperatures and receive no compensation for high temperatures may seek legal rights and interests through the labour dispute mediation agency in which the enterprise is located, or call 12333 to file a complaint.
Workers who refuse to pay high-temperature benefits may file a complaint with the human resources social security authority at the district level or above where the worker is employed.
At the same time, due to the fact that high-temperature benefits are part of the wage and not benefits, they are included in the total wage and reduced by a tax.
Therefore, the high temperature allowance is not covered by the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be replaced in kind with beverages etc.
The newly constructed Urumqi station is located in the high-story area of the city of Urumqi, with an overall area of approximately 100,000 square metres.
One or two floors on the ground are entrances, waiting rooms and offices, commercial rooms, and one basement is exit level.
At present, the Urumqi station is the largest integrated traffic hub in Xinjiang, with high irons, orbital traffic, public transport, rental, etc., that allows seamless docking by various modes of rotation.
There are 3 ticket offices on both the north and south sides of the station level and on the north side of the outer level, with 39 person ticket windows and 34 ATMs.
With regard to tickets, there are 30 passages on both the east and west sides of the waiting hall. Passengers can be checked quickly, depending on the number of the stop on the ticket.
If you need help, you can select from the 41 call buttons set up on the motion station, and you can be provided with timely services.
From July 1st, the old passenger station, the passenger train from the southern station of Urumqi, moved in separate steps to the station of Urumqi.
In other words, all cars and 30 pairs of exterior trains can stop at Urumqi Station.
Now, both stations can buy tickets, and the train between them is about 10 minutes away, and passengers need to be aware of the exact name of the stop from which the tickets are shipped and the terminal.
The official operationalization of the Urumqi new passenger station will be an important platform for building a national integrated transport city in Xinjiang, advancing the Silk Road economic belt and the construction of the new zone.
Grescia is a cute female big-mouthed bird with tropical rainforests all over her body.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the story of the giant mouthbird, Gracia, is well known.
At the press conference on August 10th, the post-operative resonant Grescia finally showed the people its brand-new 3D plastic beak.
A year and a half ago, this big, dying-mouthed bird, finally reborn.
This day not only proclaims that it has recovered 100% of its health, but also that it has moved into the luxury birdhouse and met its human friends who care about it.
Grescia, the new home, is a little rough, but not very often, he becomes alive, he's playing around in the water basin, eating grapes with new beaks.
In order to remind people of the harm it had suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but kept the original white 3D print material.
The bird's beak is a thin layer of angular gills, empty in it, with only fine bone support poles staggered.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the giant mouthbird's beaks are fragile and break when hurt.
The Animal Rescue Center, the Ornithologist and an American 3D printing company, worked together to create several test beaks for Gracia and finally created the perfect beak for it.
Now Gracia is skilled in drinking water with new beaks, eating and even pecking small grains.
"The design of the final product took about two months, and it took 4 or 5 hours to print it out."
"3D printing is not a future technique, it's actually going into your life." Thomas Lange, President of SG3D printing in the United States, said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, at a farm in Gracia, Alajuela province, central Costa Rica, a bloody giant-mouthed gresia was discovered.
Its upper beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, and it was completely unattended and its life was in danger.
Gracia's tragedy, which was reported in the media, has generated an up-to-date outcry against abusive animals both inside and outside Costa Rica.
There are calls for stricter animal protection laws and stronger penalties for abusers.
People came on their own and did their best to help Grace get back to life before he got hurt as much as possible.
Even the 3D print technology inventor, Chuck Hull, was involved in the design of the Gracia upper beak.
"Grescia is in a very special situation, and the rest of its upper beak is less than 1 centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak... "
"We scan Grescia and then design an extended prosthesis slightly longer than the rest of its upper beak and stick it to its upper beak. "
"This will reduce further invasive harm to Grescia... "ranger told Xinhua International.
Prior to the installation of the prosthesis, the staff had to clean out Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection.
A thousand miles away, the story of the giant Grescia touched the famous documentary director, Paula Eredia, and the producer of the Discovery News Channel, John Hoffman.
They recorded a little drop in Gracia's installation of a new beak, and they made a documentary, "The Great Mouthing Bird Nation", which was shown on the Animal Planet Channel this month.
The documentary "The Great Mouthbird Nation" shows people how a small big mouthbird can change a country and involve its citizens in the fight against animal abuse.
Core reminder: Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China's small independent refinery known as the Teapot.
The Japanese media reported on August 12 that the largest oil company in Japan, JX Energy, believed that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for its low level of interest.
The Japanese oil company is particularly wary of the rise of China's small independent refinery known as the Teapot.
China’s quality of petroleum products is getting closer to Japan’s oil products as the Chinese government enforces environmental regulations.
Before obtaining a permit to import crude oil, the Teapot Refinery usually imports heavy oil with a high sulphur content from Russia and elsewhere for refining.
The high levels of sulphur produced from petroleum products and poor oil products are among the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining a permit to import crude oil, the Teapot Refinery was able to import Omani and Russian crude oil with a low sulphur content, and its petroleum products were upgraded in quality.
General Oil Company East Flame says, "As the quality standards of petroleum products in China rise, so does the capacity of refining equipment.
As a result, the quality of China's petroleum products exported abroad has gradually reached the same level as that of Japan."
According to JX Energy, "After the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia" to compete with Japanese products in Asian markets.
Despite the crisis in Japan's high oil industry, the Japanese oil company has only responded with a strategy of "exporting to profitable areas while paying attention to market conditions".
Since Chinese exports of petroleum products have an enormous impact on Asian markets, there is growing interest in teapot refineries.
On May 26, 2016, the Yanko Evening News Sunshine Initiative was launched, and after two months of registration, the total number of poor students applying for scholarships was more than 800.
In the course of school aid, social donations of more than 1.2 million yuan (in five volumes) have been received to help at least 240 Quantico Dream University students.
Contributions are still being made, and the newspaper calls on society to continue to help so that more children from families in need can receive financial support and social care.
In order to ensure impartiality, openness and transparency in the teaching aid programme, the newspaper has since now issued a series of instructions on the basic information of the student student, which is now in its 1,100th place under the supervision of the reader.
The Liam Sunshine Initiative, a famous charitable brand in China, has been in operation since 2003 in Jiangsu, funding over 4,000 poor students.
This activity is funded by admission to undergraduate high school and does not include tuition-free specializations; merit and merit; and family poverty.
According to the Bureau of Statistics, the population increase in New Zealand was only over 2 per cent during the birth peak of the "baby tide" in "974 and the 1950s to early 1960s".
As of June of this year, New Zealand's two-month net immigration inflows of 6.9 million people have been the main driving force behind New Zealand's population growth in recent years.
In addition, during the same period of time, the natural population growth in New Zealand was 28.2 million.
The data show that in the last year, New Zealand's average annual net immigration inflows were 2.08 million, and the average annual natural population growth was 3.23 million.
In terms of population structure, a massive influx of immigrants means a gradual increase in the proportion of the "working-age population" between the ages of 5 and 39.
During the two-month period up to June 20, New Zealand 's working age population grew by 3.6 per cent to reach 580,000.
At the same time, the increase in the number of older persons over 65 years of age was also 3.6 per cent, reaching 700,000.
Yesterday at about 10 a.m., X9003 international cargo squads were taken from the new station in Xian to Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The train's departure marks the successful passage of 10,000 cars by the Xian Railways since the start of the Central Asian International Freight Line in 2013.
It is understood that the class of goods to be transported in this class covers industrial raw materials, mechanical equipment, industrial spare parts, construction materials, food, light products, and 206 varieties.
As of 11 August of this year, a total of 221 trains, 1009 vehicles had been opened at the new station in Central Asia, with a cumulative shipment of 338,000 tons of exported goods, of which 84 were in 2016, an increase of 47 per cent over the previous year.
It is known that the first shipments of the Central Asian class were made by "Sangxi", and today it attracts a large number of foreign sources.
By the end of July, Central Asian class containers had reached 64,000 mark boxes, an increase of 8 per cent over the same period in 2015.
With the encrypting of the Central Asian squadron, the volume of cargo at the new Xian Railway station has increased year by year.
In 2015, traffic at the new station amounted to 24.77 million tons of cargo through the year and, as at 10 August 2016, cargo delivery had reached 15.31 million tons, an increase of 6.7 per cent over the same period last year.
In order to meet future development needs, the Xian Railways Agency ' s plans for the construction of a new integrated railway logistics centre in Xian, centred on a new station, have been put in place with a view to building a new and modern integrated railway logistics park.
An old Indian uncle who had been hit last week by a plane landing at Dubai International Airport, awarded a $1 million prize this week at the same airport.
Muhammad Bashir Abdul Hidar, an Indian from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, has a habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returns.
His 21-year-old son was paralysed by an accident 13 days after being born, and he worked hard to repay his son's medical loan.
"It was God who gave me a second chance to escape from the crash, and he gave me this money to do good," said Hidal.
Even though it's a fall, the power of Autumn Tigers seems to be nothing worse than summer.
Ultraviolet not only darken their skins, but also sunburns their skins. How can they survive the training without getting sunburned?
SPFs and PAs are usually marked on sunscreen packaging, SPFs refer to sun protection indexes, UVB UV, and our common SPF index is 15,30,50 etc.
Products marked with PA are targeted at UVA, so sunscreens can be more effective, and usually PA strength is expressed in +, with an additional + indicating extended effective protection time.
The oily skin should have chosen waterproofing supplies with a high permeability, and sunscreening is a good option.
Dry skins should choose sunscreens of frost; neutral skins are generally not strictly regulated, and any maintenance on sensitive skins is a burden, and pure physical sunscreens are recommended.
Remember to put sunscreen on half an hour ahead, because sunscreen takes time to fully penetrate the skin.
Military training days are long, sunscreens are used every two hours to have lasting effects. Don't be lazy.
Because of the sun stimuli on the skin, the army has been instructed not to use white products immediately.
After the military training, conditions can be used to cover the ice with towels for the burning skin to slow the local heat.
Farmers who purchase agricultural machinery during the fair continue the policy of cumulation subsidies, with farmers receiving up to 40 per cent subsidy for the purchase of agricultural machinery.
The exhibition was aimed at a global audience and, in particular, increased invitation to countries along the "one-way" route and to target market countries.
The exhibition sought to complete 60 contracts, introduce 22 billion yuan in funds, conclude more than 160 trade contracts and $3.2 billion.
According to the information received, the reason for the 7-year-long liquidation of the "Hong Kong Expo" is because the manufacturing industry in Ludi City, Hunan Province, is very well-established and has developed over a long period of time.
As host of the Expo, Lou has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
The Expo has become an important platform for the development of local niche industries, pushing them out of the country.
In some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go further.
The U.S. Air Force is interested in copying this effect, according to the U.S. Mass Science website on August 11th.
While having a stable large number of free electrons in the ionosphere can help people listen to this radio station on the edge of a university radio station, it may not be the interest of the American Air Force.
The electrons-filled ionosphere means that the radios used by the military have a greater reach and that it may provide some protection against solar storms for GPS signals.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of Cube satellites that can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first of all, these teams that have contracted with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
Industry data show that the total coal production capacity in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons, with a national excess capacity of 1.8 billion tons.
In the last 10 years, the State Department has issued five notices to phase out excess and backward capacity.
Although the first four times did not target the coal industry, the target industry has a direct relationship with the coal industry.
Between November and January of last year, the price of 5,500 kilocalories of coal on the island of Qin has been at a long low of $370 per ton, with 90 per cent of coal companies in a loss.
The price of coal has been rising since February, and recently the price of powered coal on the island of Qin has risen four weeks in a row, rising to a 16-month high, once reaching $436 per ton, almost $70 more than at the beginning of the year.
With the price recovery, there are fears that a small coal mine will come back to work.
In response, Xi Xianming, Director of the Economic Research Institute of the China Institute for Reform and Development, analysed and interpreted the situation.
Qing Xianming: The elimination of capacity has attracted a great deal of attention, and today's published report card on the power of the coal industry does cause some concern.
These three surface factors also reflect the relative lag in our past shift in growth patterns, which have not yet been fundamentally transformed by government-led growth patterns.
Second, it is also directly related to the advancement of local governments, where funding and accompanying measures are available in the process of producing capacity, and where differences between regions do appear to be greater.
Third, if some provinces that are currently at a slower pace are to catch up in the second half of the year, they may be at greater risk.
In this case, reliance on central reward funds to advance the process of decapitation may have a negative impact.
First of all, it's not simple to do volume control.
Our aim is to promote structural optimization by phasing out backward capacity and reshaping the new industry of the coal industry as a whole.
In the process of deploying to production capacity, local governments must combine the transformation of the production capacity with the upgrading of the coal industry and vigorously develop related services.
Secondly, if we are to complete this year ' s decapitation mission, we still need to use the full force of administrative oversight and oversight.
Finally, we need to strengthen the social security agenda.
Because the market is directly related to employment, we need to enhance employment skills training for employees and employees.
"The decline in the ranking is due to the expected deterioration in the development of Brazil ' s GDP in the medium term... "
Brazil ' s participation in global direct investment was 3.7 per cent in 2015, down from 5.7 per cent in 2014.
The Bank ' s international investment attraction index includes four sub-indicators: infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and direct investment volumes.
In 2015, Brazil ' s international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, greenfield investment in Brazil (investment model for foreign investment) was $17.9 billion, a 2.1 per cent decrease over the previous year.
"There are 288 `greenfield investment' projects in Brazil, compared to an annual average of 314 from 2003 to 2014".
However, international direct investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion in the first half of 2016, an increase of almost 10 per cent over the same period last year.
Original title: Canadian Police Shooting Supporters of IS: Homemade Bomb Attack near the end of the city's preparations
The taxi company says the taxi was transferred to Delev's house before the police arrived.
In a press conference on Wednesday, the Canadian police indicated that they had received information, including a "Sacrificial Video" from the FBI, about the young man's imminent attack.
According to the German Voice, a man wearing a black Balaklafa cap is reading the Koran, referring to crimes against Muslims, and swearing to attack a city in Canada soon.
In the video, he said that the attack would take place within 72 hours and at a peak.
The incident was the first time that the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been killed by the police in front of a terrorist suspect since he took office last year.
The upgraded Jinghangen canal branch channel, the Old Van Fortune, has been charging tolls since 1 September on the North Great Leakway.
The two tributary routes were built in the form of social financing, and the charges were approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The old Van Fu channel runs through Kim's village, the fish towers, and the Southyang Lake leads to the main channel of the Jinghang Canal, which is 32.5 kilometres long.
In accordance with navigational needs, the old Vanford channel has been modified in a conservation and preservation manner, with deep dredging of the local water depths, stubbling of the local bends, and so on, and improved navigation conditions.
The channel runs through the county of Kim, Xing City, and passes Southyang Lake into the main channel of the Jinghang Canal, which is 19 km long.
The renovation of the two routes began in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015 with the construction and operation of the Anping Canal Logistics Centre in Jinning City.
In accordance with the principle of "loan construction, fee repayment", the Jinning City Anping Canal Logistics Service Centre collects tolls on the way tolls based on the rates approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Office.
Of this amount, base tolls are calculated at $1.75/heavy tonnage, and mileage tolls at 0.05/km heavy ton.
Tolls will be collected from 15 June 2016 to 14 June 2019.
According to the reporter, there are currently four toll lanes in Jinning's territory: the Su River channel, the White Ma channel, the North Big Leakway and the Old Van Fort.
The four channels are tributary routes of the King Hang Canal, which are upgraded by means of social financing.
The Su-Water Waterway Upgrading Project was the first to adopt the "Government Plus Market" model for a project to build the riverine infrastructure in Shandong Province, with the government taking the lead in investment, and the social capital replenishment gap.
The sea lanes of the White Horse River, the Old Hail River, the Great Northern Leap River, are based on a purely marketed approach.
The funds allocated by the State budget do not meet the construction needs and limit the pace of the upgrade of the course.
Social funding for public infrastructure development is in line with national policies and serves as a means of breaking financial bottlenecks.
Ning Zeto's performance in the 100-metre free swim semi-finals has left many Chinese viewers speechless.
But in the 50-metre free swim premonition, Ninzawato refreshed people's bottom line.
The fact that 50 meters of free swimming is not Ning Zetao's theme, his performance and best grades at the Kazan World Cup also determine that he is unlikely to make a breakthrough on this project.
As you can see, the Hong Kong authorities' "big communiqué" revealed that the biggest cause of Ninzawato's loss was his loss of interest in swimming.
There are many factors out there that may have had a great impact on his thinking about the future, and he may now be more interested in entering the entertainment world.
After the Kazan World Cup, Ninzawato became a net red with his super-colored and good grades.
So, the names "national husband" and "sweet meat" and "beautiful man" and so on became labels on him.
All kinds of business come to the door, the good money, it's a golden path.
In this case, even if Ning Zeto chooses to retire from the entertainment business at this time, it is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable path.
After all, he's 23 years old, and with a certain amount of learning, he can do a TV show or two with his personality.
But Ning Zeto needs to see if he has sufficient qualifications to compare himself with those of his predecessors.
The 2000 Sydney Olympics, 21-year-old Liu Xing, have come to the end of his athletic career.
Ms. Liu's appearance has quickly been remembered and laid the foundation for her future career in the entertainment world.
After he retired, Liu Xiang appeared in a number of TV dramas and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tanya took part in the single-double-tone 10-metre games of the two Olympics and won 2 golds and 2 silvers.
But after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympics single-man 10-meter race, Taomi's game fell and was fired from the jump team.
And he and his daughter went to a variety show like "Where Daddy goes," and he made an eyeful.
The golden generation of gymnastics, Yang Wei, Li Xiaoping and Chen Iixing are high-profile for all kinds of art.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li Xiao Peng led China to the 2008 Olympic Boys League, and Yang Wei received his personal gold medal twice, known as the All-power King.
Chen Ician, while leading China to the 2012 Olympics, became the King of the Rings.
And after the London Olympics was misjudged to have lost the gold medals, Chen's move of ice made him so much.
But these athletes still have their main energy on the playing field, and they're just like dragonflies -- they run off.
But both retired and active athletes, getting the favors of the entertainment business requires winning grades.
After all, athletes enter a new field, whether they're capable or they're connected, they're blank.
Even the old people who've been in the entertainment business for years, even if it's Ta-soo, the average audience is talking about them, more about their performance at the Olympics.
And Yang Wai, Lee Xiaojun, the newcomers, when they show up, they're all Olympic champions, without exception.
The title of Ningzawato as a swimming champion is still a little thin compared to the others.
Moreover, the negative impact on the image of Yugumi, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others may be incalculable if Ning Zetao were 23 years old.
After all, when it comes to athletes, people are asking for "no fight, but no risk," which is far from Ningzawato.
Ten thousand steps back, Ning Zeto is handsome and can count on face value to gain support for thousands of brain powders.
It's not as difficult as training to get back in the way you should.
The way of life is a matter of personal will, but how to choose, Ninzawa-Tao must have known it.
On the face of it, social networking has expanded the social circle and reduced people's sense of loneliness.
The growing influence of cybersocialization not only replaces traditional telephone connections, but even penetrates into the real life under the line and changes the social life of the current population.
The benefits of online socialization are obvious, such as convenience and speed, so they are particularly vulnerable to young people.
A survey of the social habits of university students showed that 57 per cent of university students spend more than five hours a day using their mobile phones, and that daily life is basically "stopped."
" Social networks are low-cost, fast-transmission, multi-person communication, etc., and meet the needs of contemporary university students... "
Expanding the circle of relationships, talking more equally and avoiding social concerns is the main reason why we're talking more and more in love.
Newcomers like to communicate with colleagues on the line, "because they don't know each other very well, they get a lot closer than they used to be on social platforms."
Friends are also used on the line, "I haven't been able to communicate with friends for some time because of some misunderstandings, and then I'm in a big group before I get back together."
The IT engineer, Wu Xin, is a deep network social lover, and most of his social life is online, and the number of online contacts is several times higher than the number of people in the inner circle.
Wu said himself to be more "fish and water" on the Internet.
"You can answer your friends at your convenience, because there's a lot of time to think, and the expression can be clearer ... "
"You came to me under ID to avoid face-to-face human collisions and not only gave me room to spin, but even gave each other more time and space to think and act. "
"People of different identities have the same right to speak and the same efficiency, and social concerns in real life seem to have been eliminated in cyberspace..."
But his friend Wu-Nin thinks he's a very boring man.
Peng and Wu Xin knew each other in a large group, because they were both active speakers and soon became acquainted.
Peng thinks that if Wu and the Internet are two people who don't speak freely and don't express their opinions, it's like, "Oh, yeah, yeah," or "I'm gonna check this online."
The mausoleum police are now involved in the investigation, and the mausoleum traffic department will step up its efforts to combat the illegal operation of vehicles.
"The conflict police of 4 August has yet to find out, and the taxis of two other drivers were smashed again at their place of residence on 11 August at 0100 hours ... "
"Most of the tricycles now operate illegally at night, and it is hoped that the authorities will also step up their efforts to deal with them. "
The South China Sea Network journalist learned from the Police Department of the Autonomous County of the Mahilai, that the police are now seized of the two cases and that the causes of the two cases, who committed them, whether they were connected or not are under further investigation.
Wang Wenyi, Director of the Traffic Control Station of the mausoleum water and transport department, said that the mausoleum transport department had begun the clean-up of illegal camps carrying three-wheelers at the beginning of the year and had banned 613 illegal camps carrying three-wheelers.
As a next step, the transport department will apply to the county government for a joint multi-sectoral effort to clean up illegally operated vehicles such as tricycles, motorcycles, black cars, etc. throughout the county.
On August 11th, at 8 a.m., a reporter from the Tsiru Evening newspaper followed the Healthy China Line team to the village of Lake Town, West of the East Port district.
The remote location of the village, approximately 24 kilometres from the city, with more than 200 households living in the village, has caused inconvenience to many elderly and middle-aged patients due to economic, transport and physical constraints.
It's a more comprehensive project, internal medicine, surgery, respiratorys, psychiatry, dermatology, pediatrics.
A lot of villagers have been waiting in the small squares of the village to hear about the medical experts coming.
67-year-old Mrs. Xue suffers from a congenital spinal curve, and in recent years she has been suffering from asthma, which has caused her to breathe even on the previous slope.
The doctor told Mrs. Xue that chronic bronchitis was not likely to be treated for it, and that it would be easier to insist on medication.
At the dermatologist's clinic, an old man in his 60s came with her grandson.
Old man's grandson is 11 years old, and since he was 3 years old, he's been suffering from foot breath on his left foot.
The doctor told the old man that it wasn't a foot gas, it was a seasonal wet rash, and don't take any medication to delay treatment.
"In this village, we offer medical and B Super, while the other team provides free medical check-up services in the village of Qiu, in the village of Huen, in the village of Suen City.
This visit is only one part of the `Healthy China Line', and other activities will continue in the days to come. "
51 Talk Free English is considered a milestone in building an online education industry biosphere.

The Central Bank renewed its licence for payment of 27 non-banking institutions, including payment of treasures, for a further five years.
In order to consolidate operational resources, achieve economies of scale and increase regulatory efficiency, this extension of the payment agency for the proposed merger of "paying operating licences" will adjust its scope of operations accordingly.
The consolidated paying agency shall complete the payment commissioning within six months of the date of the announcement.
The People's Bank of China will have the relevant "paying business license" cancelled and exchanged upon completion of the commissioning.
This extension reduces the scope of operations due to serious operational irregularities by some paying agencies, stagnation of operations or the type of operations that have been voluntarily requested to be terminated.
The relevant agency shall cease to perform the related payments in an orderly manner within six months of the date of the announcement, as required.
The People's Bank of China will continue its work on the renewal of the payment licence in accordance with the law.
No casualties from the 4.4, 4.5 magnitude earthquake in the Tibetan Nyma district

The news agency Avesta of Tajikistan quoted the central bank of Tajikistan on 11th, stating that the rate of inflation in Tajikistan was 3.7 per cent for the first seven months of the year.
According to reports, the rate of inflation in the Tatmadaw for the first seven months of the year was 3.7 per cent, of which 0.6 per cent was in July, compared to 6 per cent in the last year.
According to reports, the goal of the Tatmadaw is to keep the annual inflation rate at 7.5 per cent in 2016, compared to 5.1 per cent in 2015.
In addition, reports indicate that there is a certain discrepancy between the Government and the projections of some major international financial institutions with regard to the development of the country ' s economy and inflation in 2016 ...
According to the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development ' s projections, growth in Ta ' s economy will reach 7 per cent in 2016, and the country ' s inflation is also largely above that level ...
The Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided different projections for the development of the Tajik economy and inflation in 2016.

On August 11, when the journalist interviewed Huang Elin, who had returned to his home in Sichuan, she said, "It was too urgent for me to think only of saving people!"
Huang Elin is a class 2015 student at the Central and Southern Linco Gardens Institute.
Huang Elin, who studied urban and rural planning, wanted to go to Sichuan to study the local architecture, and then went to the family.
On August 8th, at about 10 a.m., Huang Elin's father rested at the hotel, and the mother and daughter came out to hang out in the Middle Ages.
I just walked away, and suddenly I saw a bunch of people screaming and walking around out of curiosity.
"The little boy's gone, the little girl's in the water, she's got her little head on the river, and she's sinking from time to time." As a kid, Huang Elin, who learned to swim, jumped in a hurry to save people.
After the water went down, a 165-centimetre- tall Huang Elin found out that she couldn't get to the bottom!
The water looked calm before, but it's full of currents!
But she still swims to the little girl at all costs.
Huang Elin said that the river was thick and fast, less than five meters away, and that almost all her strength was spent.
She did everything she could to push the little girl to the dyke, "The slopes are particularly slippery, and I'm afraid I'm going to sink. "
So Huang Elin called for help from her mother, heard her daughter's call, and Ms. Yoon was ready to go into the water and was stopped by tourists next to her.
On August 10, following the spread of Huang Elin's escape, Ms. Yoon received a lot of condolences from her family and friends and was also "accountable" by them.
"To be honest, my heart is breaking when the children are dying on the river's embankment and calling for help. "
Ms. Yoon said that, despite the danger, she would still support the daughter's choice and she was proud of her daughter if she were to be in that situation again!
Since she was forced to swim, Huang Elin rarely came in after learning to swim, "I didn't think this skill was really useful."
According to Chief Chen of Huang Elin's class, Huang Yillen is a well-known "teacher" of Ben's class and is willing to help.

Northeast Tiger, currently listed as endangered (EN) species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Endangered Species.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, data from joint monitoring in 1998 by countries such as the United States and Russia show that there are only 4 to 6 wild north-east tigers and 3 to 5 north-east leopards in Jilin Province.
According to the Chief of the Protection Service of the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, Changchun, the protection of wildlife has been increasing in Jilin Province in recent years, Northeast Tiger and Northeast Jaguar populations in China are growing significantly and the distribution area is expanding.
The latest monitoring data for 2015 show that 27 wild north-east tigers and 42 north-east leopards were monitored in Jilin Province alone.
Cooperation between China and Russia as world wildlife conservation flagship species in the region of the border between China and Russia is important for the recovery and reproduction of wild northeast tigers and leopards.

Sun Fook-jin, as a leader of the party, lost his idealistic beliefs and seriously violated the party ' s discipline, and after the party ' s 18th year, he remained unsettled, unstoppable, undisciplined, bad nature and serious circumstances.
After this case, after many media reports, it became the focus of the case, and the social impact was extremely bad.
After the incident, the head of the criminal police unit of the Haiguchi Public Security Bureau attached great importance to it, and immediately organized a team of strong police officers to launch an investigation.
The police immediately pursued the suspect online, took a variety of measures to locate him and, by contacting the police in the field, investigated the whereabouts of Wang's country.
As the suspect is a repeat thief, he has been dealt with repeatedly by the public security authorities, has a strong counter-detection capability and, together with his long-term drug addiction, is often used to interrogate drug addicts, and interrogations are very difficult.
Greenland sharks, also known as small sleeping sharks, are widely distributed around Greenland and Iceland in the North Atlantic, reaching a height of 4-5 metres when they reach adulthood.
But they grow very slowly, sometimes only about a centimetre in a year, which suggests that Greenland sharks may have the life expectancy of Foreign Minister Ge.
Traditional year-to-year methods usually use animal calcification tissues, some sharks can use fin ridges, but this calcification tissue is very rare in Greenland sharks.
The new study led by Julius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, turned to an eye crystallized Greenland shark for the Year of Radiocarbon Measurement.
This method was previously used to determine the age of whales, but for the first time to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis shows that the life expectancy of the largest shark is estimated to be 392, with an error of 120 years.
That means that this shark is at least 272 years old, possibly 512 years old.
In addition, female Greenland sharks are said to be about 4 metres long for their sexual maturity and converted to age, i.e. at least 156 years.
As a result, researchers wrote in their papers that Greenland sharks are known on Earth, the longest-lived vertebrates, more than the previous Longevity Champions of the Worm (211).
Over the past year, the exchange rate of the renminbi has remained generally stable, and the foundation has been laid for the internationalization of the renminbi.
In terms of market performance, the two-way fluctuations of the RMB over the past year have been marked by increased exchange rate elasticity and the expected overall stability of the exchange rate.
To date, the renminbi has fluctuated over 100 points in the median dollar, but the process has become counterproductive.
Last year's last transfer before the 8/11 transfer was implemented in 2005, with a significant appreciation of the renminbi against the United States dollar over a decade.
Since the introduction of the new remittance, the renminbi has changed its previous appreciation, with the median exchange rate depreciating by about 8% over a year.
On 1 October of this year, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the renminbi as the weight currency of the SDR.
This week, the statistics published by the China Customs Administration show that China ' s exports and imports for the first seven months of the year totalled 13.21 trillion yuan, a decrease of 3 per cent over the same period last year.
In the month of July, China ' s total exports and imports fell by only 0.9 per cent per year, especially exports, which increased by 2.9 per cent per year.
According to the experts concerned, despite signs of stabilization of imports and exports in July, expectations should not be overestimated.
In July, China ' s exports and imports totalled RMB 2.09 trillion, down 0.9 per cent from the previous year.
Of this amount, exports of RMB 1.22 trillion, an increase of 2.9 per cent; imports of RMB 873 billion, a decrease of 5.7 per cent; trade surpluses of RMB 34.28 billion, an increase of 34 per cent.
Although total exports and imports have declined over the years, export data have increased, which is also the fifth consecutive month of export growth since March of this year.

In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will travel to Kenya to attend the 6th African Development Conference, according to the Chinese Voice News Night Summit.
The Conference on African Development, led by Japan, had been held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, and would therefore be the first to move Africa.
In this regard, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan stated that the convening of a local conference in Africa would help draw attention to Japan in Africa and Europe.
In conjunction with Shinzo Abe's visit, according to the Joint News Agency, the Japan Democratic Party will send a parliamentary delegation to the countries concerned.
It is no coincidence that Japan's path to "normality" began in the early 1990s, and that the African Development Conference, launched by Japan, also began in 1993.
With 53 seats in the United Nations, Africa is an important ticket warehouse for the United Nations. How can Japan, if it wants to be “normal”, abandon Africa?
There will also be an exchange of views with national stakeholders on the response of extremist organizations, the Islamic State, and terrorist activities.
Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau.
The Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Man-sung Akada, also recently stated his intention to the United Nations Security Council in connection with the African Development Conference.
Abe announced on this occasion that, for the sake of stability in sub-Saharan African countries, 100 billion yen (approximately 6.1 billion yuan) would be provided over five years.
Observers generally agree that Japan ' s generosity to Africa has been aimed primarily at two objectives: first, to increase the sense of Japan ' s presence in Africa; and second, to win the support of African countries on the issue of normality.
The Japanese expert on the Yang Bojiang has analysed it as saying, "In political terms, Africa, although relatively developing, has a relatively large number of countries, so Japan has always considered it as the so-called `big ticket field'. "
Japan will not give up in the future, it will not end its work in Africa and it will continue to grow.
On the economic front, because of Japan ' s relatively strong productive capacity, the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the context of the ageing of young children, where domestic demand is currently relatively low.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi 10 years ago, to Abe 10 years later, Japan has repeatedly launched the usual "sprint" and has returned.
The Japanese expert on Japan, Yang Bojiang, believes that Japan's usual intentions are obvious, but the path to normality is bound to be difficult.
In order for Japan to achieve its goals, it must first establish relations with neighbouring countries, in which Japan needs to adopt a correct attitude, whether in geopolitical or ethnic disputes or historical awareness.

The opening of the Hong Kong Vi Garden with the introduction of a new light from traditional practices.
The music of drums, traditional snacks, fancy decorations, crowds.
Hong Kong's largest Xinan victory was held in Victoria Park from 12 to 14 on the occasion of the 2016 Xianan Cultural Festival, hosted by the Hong Kong Congregation.
In addition to the continuation of the existing "single races", it has added the "maternity-baby-battle races" to which the whole family can participate.
Not only is the history of Xinan culture presented in cartoon form, but there are self-profiling areas for the Xinan theme 3D, traditional snack areas and traditional handicraft mobile classrooms, which attract a lot of young people and people from abroad.
A couple from France spent almost three hours at the event and experienced it in a mini-fashion mobile classroom.
"We found this special holiday online, so we decided to come and see it fresh."
They said that, while France had a similar holiday to those of its ancestors, the atmosphere was heavy, unlike here, there was music and food to learn traditional crafts.
She said, "In such a busy financial city in Hong Kong, you can also see such a large, organized ritual worship of your ancestors."
" Not only does the diversity of Chinese culture manifest itself, but it also allows more people to understand and transmit these traditional crafts ... "
"We don't want to set up Xinan cultural festivals to be horrifying, especially for children."
"We want to make young people aware, through the rejuvenation and organization of the scene, that what is behind the Xinan culture is filial and gratefulness... "

The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience impressed the young actress and actress.

On the morning of 12, Liu Tsigui hosted a symposium to hear a briefing on the progress of the Sanya "During the Twin Cities" pilot and the suggestions of the departments concerned.
Liu Jigui has given full recognition to the phased results of the pilot exercise and the good experiences that have been generated.
Liu Chigui stressed that Sanya must seize the opportunity of historical development and use the two-city pilot as an important tool to play a leading role in the economic and social development of the province.
To play a leading role in raising the internationalisation of international tourism islands, starting with a drop in detail, enriching international elements, and building international excellence.

The Secretary-General of the Provincial Council, Zhang Qi, Vice-Governor Wang Lu, and the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Hoshio, participated in the research workshop.
During his 14 years of sports career, Deng Yaping won 18 world championships and became the first person in the history of the Chinese Olympics to win four Olympic gold medals.
She's ranked first in the world for eight years in a row, the oldest sportswoman in the history of Ping-Pong.
On 26 September 2010, he served as Deputy Secretary-General of the People ' s Daily News and General Manager of the People ' s Search Network Holding Company, and was a member of the Bureau.
Today, she will work with Yu Minhong to build the country's first sports industry innovation platform.
There are also such a group of star coaches on China ' s body: they have won countless honours for the country as athletes; after retirement, they have taught the lessons learned for many years to those who have won the championship.
As the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yu Bin opted to take the whip.
From female coaches to male coaches to chief coaches, Huang Yu Bin built an Olympic gold band, and even better team achieved 9 gold and 1 silver and 4 copper myths at the Beijing Olympics.
Since then, Tanyo has been advertising, and more recently he's been playing such important roles as "Cowboy" and "Rayfon".
A lot of NBA players have proven their strength, but some progress and others fall.
Whether due to age or time constraints, there are some players who show up in every season that are regressing.
Of course, some "regress" may just be a reduction in data, and these players may not be losing their strength.
Even if Wade was one of the best scoring guards in the league, he wouldn't be as hot as a bull.
He's got a limited range of rear range with Lundo, and the three-point hit of the player Butler is only 32.8%, which will crowd them in the next season.
When the wind comes, the lightningman must give more power to Butler and Londo, probably choosing the way to feed himself in the regular races.
The situation in Okafu was awkward, and as a first choice for 76 people in the last season, he had to compete with Simmons and Embeld for time and rights in the new season.
The race may not be fast, Simmons will have to adapt to the NBA, and Embide will recover from the injury and illness as soon as possible, but it is still a question whether or not Okafu will be in the 76 long-strength.
Last season, Okafu scored 32 per cent from low-level attacks, which were higher than Coxins, Vuchevich and Brooke López, and his use was also high at the top 40.
As Simmons has shown a remarkable front-loading potential and Embide has a better figure for the NBA, it's probably hard for O'Cafford to be as strong as ever.
In the last two seasons, Thompson's usage has stabilized to the top 20, and these are the two best seasons of his career.
But the problem is that with Durant's arrival, Thompson's use is going to drop, and that's going to affect his performance.
This effect will not only affect the number of hits, but will certainly be significantly reduced in the next season, which in some ways will make it less difficult for his opponent to defend himself.
Durant's coming will have to shrink the numbers of the warriors, but the most serious of them will be Thompson.
But that doesn't mean that the Tang Gods are falling back, and it's more like that he sacrificed for the team as a whole.
Parker did better than the data in the last season, not only because his basket efficiency was at its highest, but also because of his chemical reaction with Aldridge.
Duncan retired, Ginobli announced another year of war, and the combination of GDP finally ended, as the youngest of the three, with little gas in the tank of the French running car.
With the third championship ring, only Jabar, Jordan and Russellby James won more regular MVPs, and Jordan was the only one with more FMVPs than James.
Oh, by the way, James just brought Cleveland's first professional sports championship in the last 52 years.
James who came to the 14th season of his career needed better physical strength to prepare for the after season.
So, in the conventional race, James's data is likely to fall further, and he's going to give Owen more weight, but he's still going to be the first three players in the league.
"It is important to build on the skills we have learned in Russia."
On the 12th of local time, the president of the Federation of Chinese Diasporas in Moscow, Huang Jing, was excited to say when he saw the news reporter from China and China.

When you return to Moscow, you must contribute to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture with the knowledge and skills you have learned.
Yan Wei, Secretary-General of the Chinese Cultural Promotion Association of Russia, who also participated in the course, felt the same way.
She said that she had made great progress with the help of the teacher of the course and felt the burden of being an overseas distributor of Chinese culture.
Yan Wei said that when he returns to Russia, he will spread and promote Chinese traditional culture among Chinese and Chinese-loving Russians.

Deacon Haumen's representatives are known in China as Bainmunich, Dotmond and the famous football star Thomas Muller, Ram and Grate.
In conjunction with previously online tweets, cool and micro-letter platforms, the team looks forward to providing Chinese fans with wider and more accessible access to the latest news of the tournament.
The British team won silver medals in a seven-man football game, and the Fiji team won gold medals.
On Thursday night, in the finals of the seven-man football game, the British team failed to continue its outstanding performance in front of the Fiji team and was defeated by the Fiji team at the Rio Tiodoro Stadium at 43-7.
The Fiji team won the gold medal with its impeccable performance in controlling, seizing, evading, collaborating, running and power, the country ' s first Olympic medal in history.
The silver medal was also a great comfort to the defeated British team, which was the third silver medal the British delegation had won that day. This was enough to make the British football team proud: they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on the first seven-man football game to enter the Olympics.
Earlier that day, the British team won the South African team seven to five, which could have affected their status in the finals.
But in any case, the Fiji team now is enough to defeat a full-hearted 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the British team, but it may not be.
It's not easy for the British team to get what they're doing today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's teachings, they didn't win a seven-man football game in Adelaide.
And now they're only one step away from the champion.
They've been hit hard, but they've also made remarkable progress.
Fiji's opening was an advantage, leaving the British team helpless.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it's like bumping into a series of buses running.
Only four minutes after the race, Jerry Towley scored right-wing touchdown again.
Twelve to zero. The British hardly ever hit the ball.
Mitchell's powerful interdiction has left Leon Nacalava, a giant, with no third score, but it's only slowing Fiji's score.
At seven minutes, Yassa Willey Malu hit the right corner. 17 to 0, the British team is getting worse.
Then Karava gets another point, and the first half of the game is one minute away.
And then, Vatmo Rawovo broke into the British defense and went straight to the score line.
In the middle of the break, the score is already 29-to-one.
Fijians seem to be born to play seven-man football, while the British are still the first.
That's the way it is.
The British team made a big change in the second half and hit the Fijian line for four minutes, which was good for the first half, but then the Fiji team made a great team, with Joshua Tuesova again.
Dan Norton gave the British team an opportunity to score, to change the score to 36-7 on the left corner, but the race was already under the control of the South China Sea Island, and their fans sang loudly on the platform, waving flags, dancing songs.
The performance of Fiji's team has made it necessary to clapping.
Marta William stopped a frivolous attack on the Fiji team at the last minute.
The final whistle was blown, the Fijians hugged together, and the defeated British team left the scene with regret.
Earlier that day, the Fiji team defeated Japan with 20 to 5 in the semi-finals, while the United Kingdom managed to win the South African team in a fierce semi-final.
The first half of Kyle Brown helped the South African team take the lead, but Dan Norton broke the door in the second half with an excellent foot.
After that, England's Antony's brother Marcus Watson secured the team's victory with a brilliant intercept, and the British finally won the silver medal.
Helen Graves and Heather Stanning, inspired by their cancer coach, won the gold medal.
No exaggeration. It's the most moving piece of gold.
From the first rowing to the present, Helen Graves and Heather Stanning have received 220 punitive pull-out trainings, and the gold medal they took at Estacio da Lagoa has a more extraordinary meaning.
Although only two of them were the rowers, the voice of one of the men on board — Coach Robin Williams — was always accompanied by their impact on the second consecutive female pair of Olympic medals — the British first pair of girls on a boat that reached this height.
They've had 39 undefeated records, with absolute advantages.
What we're seeing is these two talented athletes walking on the surface gracefully, but it's not all about this victory.
There are many volunteers behind each of the gold medals, and it is their constant dedication that has created a difference, and none of this can be helped more than a coach who learned 30 months ago that he was suffering from cancer and wondered if he could live to see this day.
As he said, death could come at any moment.
I had bladder cancer, and they operated on me.
If we don't do it, the cancer will spread to the whole body.
That way, it'll be much worse.
It'll change your mind a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment early in 2014, minimizing the impact, although it might not be appropriate to say so in this case.
I need to get paid, so I have to get better.
It's an incentive for me.
I live in a hospital, and they say a few steps is enough, but I walk around the ward 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet.
That's the beginning of everything.
The sport itself is a journey, which makes it a little longer.
At the moment of the gold harvest, the first thing they thought about was Williams this morning, William Musby, was a little bit of a talk, in order to overcome his anxiety.
When Stanin, who was the head of the Royal Artillery Corps, went to Afghanistan, she said, "I'm in a bad mood this week, probably a bit extreme, but this gold medal is really important."
It tells me how important it is to me, how hard I, Helen, and Robin have worked.
That's Helen, Robin and I trying for three years.
Without Robin, we'd be nobody. Thank you very much. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have found a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen Grave and Heather Stanning have not lost in five years.
The punishments imposed on the combinations are beyond their competitor's control.
Even at the last 500 meters, New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanin and Grave still had huge physical reserves.
It was quite a shock.
Helen says, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It's really important not to be influenced by your opponent.
We had a good start, and we didn't expect anything to happen.
We didn't think about the glory of today, we just wanted to row every oar and win this race, and we did.
It took a year for the combinations to decide their own future.
Graves will marry Steve Bucksall next month as a television explorer.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say this is my last game.
It's putting too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It's a whole new experience, and I'm very nervous.
It's been about four minutes now.
She said, "I feel better."
The amazing structure of the L.A. Central Library was a surprise.
The American Society of Architects and Historics in Southern California organized a salon with the authors of the new book "L.A. Central Museum: Its History of Art and Architecture" by Arnold Schwartzman and Stephen Gee. The event allowed viewers to learn more about the history of the Central Library in the city center.

To celebrate the 90th anniversary of the L.A. Central Library and the release of new books.
First inflation in Bulgaria in 8 months
The results of the national statistics show that the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1 per cent in July.
This is the highest inflation rate in years (since June 2012).
Average annual inflation rate (measured by the consumer price index) for the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8 per cent.
Compared to June 2016, the consumer price index was 101.0 per cent in July 2016 and the monthly inflation rate was 1.0 per cent.
This year-to-date inflation rate (July 2016 vs. December 2015) is -0.2%. Annual inflation rate in July 2016 is -0.2% compared to July 2015.
The prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7 per cent), transportation (1.8 per cent), recreation and culture (6.3 per cent), restaurants and hotels (1.2 per cent) and other goods and services (0.3 per cent) increased in July 2016 compared to the previous month.

Snapchat's "motion" effect has been criticized for sarcastic Asians.
Snapchat suggests that this filter is self-inflicted, but some observers think it's racial.
Snapchat's 150 million daily users can change reality and make people look ridiculous through their filtering tools.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein.
These lenses have the effects of passivation, bending features, generating more than 30 million self-records per day.
Any mistake will be immediately brought to the attention of the public.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized for encouraging black people to play or be beautiful with white skin.
So, when the application this week provides some users with a filter that creates slashed eyes, weird teeth and powder face effects, some commentators call it racial irony against Asian "yellows".
They even think that these recurring problems mean that the company has a bigger problem with diversity.
After Snapchat said it was deleted, the Wednesday report of The Verge and Motherboard provoked anger.
The company explained that the filter was a tribute to the moving role, not a sarcastic Asian.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the harmful stereotypes of reality.
Others are very opposed to these oscillations.
A Korean-American artist who tweeted about the photos and was widely shared in an e-mail said that the filters were "at least painful and uncomfortable".
She also said, "It's hard to distinguish between the odious image of Asia and the effect of the filter."
Although the filters are not just yellow, the yellow people are extremely devalued.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural bottom lines.
From company boards to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusiveness.
The large youth group of Snapchat may be very sensitive because it is more racially diverse than the older generation.
When a snapchat filter created an insulting image of the user, 25-year-old Jukati said in a Thursday interview, "This kind of thing is harder to escape than it was before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer in Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article and a telephone interview for Medium, she stated that she believed that the racial controversy reflected the lack of ethnic diversity in the recruitment process of Snapchat.
Ms. Chu criticized the company's employees, most of whom were white, and the leadership, all male, and added a label at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.com.
As a Chinese American, Ms. Chu said: " Either their employees are not of all colours, so they can make such a decision, or some of their employees are colored, but their position is not open to them."
Other observers shared her complaint that she had not been answered by Snapchat.
The company did not publish data on employee diversity and stated that it was a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his staff, but one speaker stated that the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on the lower proportion of the population and promote internal inclusion.
Ms. Chu said that she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us against this behavior."
According to the Congressional team, military officials distort ISIS intelligence
In a report released on Thursday, a Congressional team noted that officials of the United States Central Command had changed their intelligence reports to describe the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than the actual situation.
This interim report is drawn from a special working group formed by the President of the Republican Party of the Military Committee of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Sub-Committee of the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee ... The report states that there is "wide displeasure" on the part of the Central Command intelligence analysts who indicate that their superiors are tampering with their assessment of the war between the United States and the Islamic State.
Central Command (Centcom) in Tampa, Florida is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news article on the report, "Information reviewed by the senior leadership of the Central Command describes United States counter-terrorism operations more optimistic than reality and has always been more optimistic than analysis by other intelligence agencies."
The representative of the Republican Party of California said, "The behavior of the Central Command is unacceptable.
The question of the leadership of the Central Command extends to the highest levels of the agency.
The report details the persistent problems of the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing the training of the Iraqi army by the United States ...
Although there is no conclusive evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration have ordered changes to these reports, according to their description, these analysts feel pressured by leaders of the Central Command to express more optimistic views on the threat posed by the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
According to the report, "in the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and parliamentary testimony were far more optimistic than the actual situation."
For example, an official of the Central Command has publicly stated that a major military operation could be launched to recover Mosul as early as April or May 2015.
The second largest Iraqi city, Mosul, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
In a statement, the representative of the Republic Party of Kansas, Mike Pompeyo, said, "After months of investigation, this result has become evident."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the high-level intelligence officers of the United States Central Command manipulated the Command ' s intelligence products and concealed the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq.
The Republicans set up a special working group after they learned from the analysts that information about the Islamic State had been manipulated.
As the investigation continues, more will be discovered after the report released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence has also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Members of the Democratic Party of the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives published their findings on Thursday, which are consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
In a statement by the Democratic Leader of the Commission, Sheinda, stated that between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command had developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of the Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeeping forces ... "
According to Mr. Sheanda, the process "impedes the release of information", reduces the morale of analysts and "cannot accept different opinions."
But Mr. Sheinda and the Democrats also stated that they had found no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on the central headquarters analysts, so that their conclusions were consistent with "pre-set or political narratives."
The Beast Daily reported on the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon Attorney General had opened an investigation after receiving a complaint from the central headquarters analyst.
The Pentagon spokesman, Major Patrick Evans, in a statement, stated that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on this parliamentary report until the investigation by the Attorney General had been completed.
But he said, "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security topics."
The impact of this investigation has exceeded the success of the United States-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria (as claimed by an increasing number of Defense Ministry officials) ...
Last year, however, these claims called into question the extent to which President Obama could trust the assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas issued by the Central Command.
The criticism of ISIS intelligence is reminiscent of the controversy over more than a decade ago, when the Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hook wrote a research article in which it was stated that George W. Bush's government, despite the opposition of many analysts, insisted on sending small troops to Iraq and had little regard for the situation following the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook played a key role in this opposition campaign on Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials stated that Mr. Hook ' s team had come to the conclusion that the air strikes against ISIS oil refineries had not significantly reduced the economic revenues of terrorist organizations, which had built temporary refineries and continued to sell oil on the black market, in contrast to the statements made.
According to the Times Weekly in September, the Central Command did not publish the discovery.
When many lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about over-optimistic assessments of the war, Central Command Commander Lloyd Austen III was criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April and is currently being replaced by Joseph Waters at the Central Command.
The United States won four consecutive championships at the Women's Hockey Competition and will win the British.
Katie Bam, the only three-dollar winner in the six-to-one victory over Japan, took the lead on Thursday for the American Women's Hockey Team, and helped the American team beat India by three-0.
Two games with five balls could be amazing, but 27-year-old Bam said she didn't know she was doing so well.
She said, "I don't know anything about it."
I'm not the kind of guy who remembers how many balls he made.
What she knows is that the United States team won four consecutive rounds of the Olympics and will be number one in the British team that won the Japanese team by two to zero on Thursday.
Britain and the United States meet on Saturday at the last round of the game.
Both teams will be promoted to the quarter final, which will determine who will be first in the team.
The team that gets the team first will avoid encountering a strong Dutch team, which will be able to go further.
In Saturday's game, the American team made a miracle with amazing performances, you know, four years ago at the London Olympics, the American team was down in 12 teams.
Bam was in that team.
Barm grew up in Brubel, Pennsylvania, first picked up a hockey stick when she was three years old (her twin sister was in Drexel for this sport) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming the youngest national team ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn't get on the final list.
In 2012, neither she nor her teammates were seen.
The next year, the British Craig Panham was the coach, and everything started to change.
Bam said, "It's a change of culture, mentality and substance."
We didn't reach our current level in London.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam pulled his head out in the first half of the game with a close reflection.
India has not won yet in this game, but this team has shown remarkable perseverance and has kept the score of 1-0 near the end of section three, when Bam broke out.
She runs a long way along the left side of the field, cuts inside to the middle, pulls into the net, and the U.S. team leads two to zero.
Melissa González shot her last ball in the middle of section four.
For the first time in the game, the American counterpart, Jackie Bridges, had a single goal in the first three victories.
This time she's playing too much.
And so is Bam.
Panam says, "We're in good shape right now," but it depends on the results of the Saturday game.
The cold and acidic food of the Great Depression.
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected President, sat in his office for lunch.
As a cuisine, President Roosevelt likes to eat on Fifth Avenue, like foie gras and Maryland's stew.
On that day, his menu was very simple: ketchup devil's eggs, mashed potatoes and pastries as snacks.
Jane Zigman said, "It's for food to share with the suffering people."
Her husband Andrew Co. added: "It also reflects the way Americans eat."
The couple living in the Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Mr. Cobbs' last book is about American Chinese food, and Ms. Zigman in her book "97 orchards" tells the lives of slum tenants through food.
The book they co-authored, "Big Foods", will be published by Harper Press on Tuesday, describing the food history of the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some common food insights, they met a journalist at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a simple lunch counter in the iron district that has been open since the collapse of the economy in 1929.
Mrs. Siegman, age 54, ordered a creamed cheese with a broken olive sandwich, while Mr. Ko, age 57, ordered turkeys, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The press ordered a meatloaf, and the couple thought it was a good idea to discuss diets during the Great Depression.
Ms. Zigman said, "The bread was very popular."
There was peanut bread, liver bread, soy bread.
They're made of a raw material and a cheap rinse that can pour on the raw material.
Imagine, your dinners are peanuts.
Mr. Cobb's got a weird face.
He said, "They must be like lead in your stomach."
In the years before the Great Depression, Americans were serving buffets, especially in the suburbs.
A bunch of women cook for men farm workers, breakfast, lunch and dinner with fresh pies.
In World War I, it was the Americans who gave food to hungry Europeans.
Mr. Ko explained why he and his wife were writing this book: "Food had become a major issue for Americans at the time."
Another unpleasant topic was the new food: the "frozen food" of bread and stew became the main dish, the "best way to cook leftovers", which Ms. Ziegler said was because the cooks could use butter from the sauce to hide the bad food.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat that has been leading the American table for years has become a rare luxury.
Strange groceries are about calories, compared to the taste, even basic cooking common sense, and nutrition is the first thing people think about.
In the course of studying the book, including the various recipes, Ms. Zigman made a roasted onion filled with peanut butter.
Mr. Coe said, "It's not common at dinner tables."
Ms. Zigman said, "It's too strange."
Peanut oil and roasted onions can't match.
It's a feature of many family meals.
Family economists influence the country ' s eating habits, such as Louis Stanley and others who worked as chefs of the Federal Bureau of Family Economy from 1923 to 1943, which is unprecedented in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines to encourage women to "tell" and be brave in turning bad foods like creamed pasta and carrots into food.
A great meal is a great "historical treasure".
Especially interesting is the government's response to hungry people, such as the President's citizen Herbert Hoover's "I can't handle other people's business."
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse as a child, his diet was as delicate as a millionaire.
Mr. Coe said, "He likes to eat European food, like fish and cucumber."
He was wearing a tuxedo and eating in a gold-plated restaurant.
He's obviously separated from the people.
If his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to set an example on the diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As this book says, the butler that Ms. Roosevelt hired has no interest in the taste, so "food in the White House is not only the worst food in Washington, but also the worst food in cooking."
As soon as the United States gets back into formality, many of the Great Depression's cooking methods are abandoned.
Ms. Ziegler said that what remained was our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
This means that when they wrote this book, they learned more about Mrs. Zigman's mother's eating habits, like how she didn't throw away her food.
Mr. Ko said, "She's very afraid of wasting food."
Ms. Zigman recalled: "She actually made many people sick."
Like there's been a Cream Puff incident.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Ko pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: this is the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
Ms. Zigman said, "It's called creamed fruit, "and added that the name of a new tide for a normal dish is "the usual trick."
There's no cream in this dessert, just fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
It's hard for all of us to make the picks deep into the sticky brown paste.
Surprisingly, this dessert tastes good.
Mr. Cobb ate the second and the third.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert, and he said to his wife, "Breaking walnuts would be better."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July and that Saudi production was even higher.
The report does not prohibit the market from questioning the credibility of OPEC, and the road to a recovery in oil prices is still, I'm afraid, full of thorns.
This Monday, the OPEC Chairman-in-Office and Minister of Energy of Qatar, Sada, indicated that OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on 26-28 September.
The monthly reports published by OPEC on Wednesday show that the production of the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, rose by 46,000 barrels per day in July to 3,311,000 barrels per day.
OPEC also stated in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have led global refiners to produce more refined oils, thus increasing market oversupply.
As a result of this information, combined with the projected increase in crude oil production in the United States and the unexpected increase in crude oil stocks, international oil prices fell for two consecutive days.
By Wednesday, the prices of light crude oil futures delivered by the New York Commodity Exchange had fallen by 2.48 per cent and London Brent futures delivered in October by 2.07 per cent.
Reuters believes that the proposed oil-producing countries conference is unlikely to result in a clear tightening of supply, and that the data published by the United States Energy Information Agency will depress the market.
Iranian official news agency Fars Wednesday, citing the statement of the Iranian Minister of Oil, Zangane, stated that Iran ' s daily crude oil production amounted to a maximum of 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
As soon as the news of the meeting came out, Russian Minister of Energy Novak said that there was no need for a new round of frozen negotiations under oil prices.
The last meeting of oil-producing countries was held in April, and no agreement was reached on any measures by the OPEC member States.
BMIResearch Oil and Gas Analyst Emma Richards states that the market and media may overreact to the meeting to be held by OPEC.
Helima Croft, head of the Grand Commodity Strategy of the Royal Bank of Canada, said that OPEC would change the mood in the market by releasing the signals that they would promote the agreement.
It's like a smoke and mirror that distracts people.
According to Eugene Weinberg, the head of the German commercial bank's bulk commodity research, OPEC was considered to have a low probability of attempting to stabilize the market through the September conference.
This could further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all, the organization played "The Wolf."
Medical advertisements for irregularities are published in all regions, complaints are concentrated, even though the focus is on spot-checking in medical institutions that have been repeatedly punished.
In due course, the National Board of Health and Planning, the National Board of Medicine and Medicine, will organize inspections of selected provinces for special supervision and inspection....
According to the media, the current homogenization of products has become a serious problem due to the massive influx of capital into Internet medicine, the tide of investment has dwindled and capital has entered the wait-and-see period.
Also, according to data from the Alipei Hospital Management Research Centre in Hong Kong, Internet health companies die in large numbers in one year of business, and about 20% of start-up Internet health companies no longer exist.
However, as most Internet-based health-care enterprises struggle on the A or B financing path, several of the leading firms in the subsector still have access to capital.
It seems that Internet medical start-ups can't be "a bee," but rather depend on the market demand, so they can stay focused and do their job.
Fish jumps of $1.2 million, or 40 per cent of registered capital, and Kyushu public equipment companies contribute $18.00 million, or 60 per cent of registered capital.
In recent years, the integrated supply chain management system has gradually moved into hospitals at all levels as national policy support for medical informatization has been made electronic.
This jump in cooperation with Kyushu Chase is precisely targeting market demand and helping hospitals build up advanced supply chain management systems as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet-based medical companies, iBaby has been focused on the vertical area of Internet obstetrics since the beginning, on both pregnant mothers and doctors.
Pregnant mothers are not only free of charge for 24 hours and one-on-one visits by a competent doctor, they can also pay for targeted medical consultations.
At the doctor ' s level, iBaby breaks the geographical limit by organizing online lectures by specialists to grass-roots doctors, peer-to-peer exchanges, case discussions, etc.
At present, there are three sections at the doctor ' s end, one for continuing education, one for socialization and the other for help.
Provision of services including e-learning, case discussions, academic exchanges; social platforms with hospitals, with clinicians; medical relationships or legal assistance needed for personal life; entrepreneurship support, etc.
According to media reports, King CEO recently said Ali's health was "willing to sink" to take the big health data.
Internet companies, data companies lack professionalism, and writing methods on the same phrase are not uniform.
Ali's current profile in the field of medical health is divided into three sections: Ali's health, the Sky Cat's dispensary and the payment of the future hospital.
Wang said it would be harder to start a healthy business than any other business, "It's not just how much it costs, it's too much to sink, it's too lonely to do it."
It's easy to break the heart to stay up all night watching the Olympics.
The Brazilian Olympics are going on like a fire, and even if they are aired in the middle of the night, many citizens will stay up and watch.
In this regard, the doctor specifically warned that there are health risks to staying up late for the game, which could cause cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up for a long time, the hormone will continue to be highly secretive, the human body will remain tense, unable to recover normally, prone to a contraction of the blood pressure and, consequently, cardiovascular disease.
Han Chi-won particularly reminds that groups with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat, smoking habits, family history and other cardiovascular risk factors are more likely to cause cardiovascular disease if they stay up late.
If you stay up long enough, not only cardiovascular functions but also gastrointestinal functions, immune systems, neuroendocrine systems will be affected, and even the risk of tumours will increase.
For old friends, Han Chi-won suggests that we try not to stay up for the Olympics, especially for groups with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last World Cup football game, Han Chi-won had a patient in his 60s with myocardial infarction or with the effect of staying up all night watching the game.
He said that, since the beginning of the year, his office has been treating patients with myocardial infarctions or strokes at the age of 25, largely as a result of the patient ' s long-term overnight lifestyle.
1. Do not stay up all night and occasionally stay up and watch the favorite sports items, other items may wait until the next day to see the event.
2. To stay up late at night to replenish water, eat more fruit, prevent vascular congestion and increase the immunity of the body.
On August 12, Beijing Time, the Chinese old General Durie won a bronze medal in the 2016 Rio Olympics.
Durie became the 4th of the Olympics, and the 4th Olympics took four medals of gold and 1 silver and 1 bronze.
In 1998, he entered the Shandong shooting squad and followed Coach Wong Devon for professional shooting training.
In June 2003, the gold medal of the female 10-metre gas rifle at the Croatian World Cup and breaking the world record with a 504.9 ring...

The film is expected to be broadcast early next year on central television and at the premiere of music and will also be launched for the first time in the VR Panorama.
The documentary "The Polars" is a large piece focusing on the third great pagoda of the Earth, telling stories about the convergence of Tibetan traditions with modern times and the interaction of Tibet with the world from a new perspective.
The greatest advantage of VR works is to give the audience a unique sense of immersion, which makes the filming process even more demanding.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war in the US and Soviet Union.
The event was seen as the culmination of the cold war, known as the Cuban missile crisis.
But what is not known is that, also during the cold war, a strong solar storm was about to lead the United States to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, which was only announced for the first time by researchers on August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm disrupted U.S. military radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the United States ballistic missile early warning system for monitoring Soviet missiles.
This paper, completed by researchers from the University of Colorado, United States, interviewed United States military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analysing the Sun and consulted non-confidential literature.
The paper wrote that in the 1960s, in order to prevent a sudden nuclear war in the Soviet Union, the U.S. Air Force always had a fleet of aircraft with nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
The U.S. military commander did not know that the main cause of the interference was the Sun Storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the aircraft to be ready for combat.
Fortunately, the solar activity of the United States military, which began in the late 1950s, and its study of Earth ' s electromagnetic interference, ultimately prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he compiled information from the United States Air Force Aeronautical Weather Service and submitted a detailed report.
As a direct consequence of this solar storm, the United States military has since considered space weather to be a combat concern and has established a stronger space weather forecasting system.
During their daily travels, citizens find that cars are blocked by strange vehicles and can use the "MicroMork" function to solve this problem without contacting strange car drivers.
On August 11th, the Xian traffic police micro-mail service, Xian traffic service, launched the Xi's mobile service.
When this service is introduced, citizens in everyday life can solve such problems by using the "MicroMork" function if a strange vehicle obstructs their vehicle in the absence of the driver.
This new service function is one that is fast and saves administrative costs; two that respects and protects the privacy of citizens; and three that is round-the-clock and full-time.
It is very easy to operate on its own, as long as the citizens have a little bit of trust, in a way that makes it easier for both parties to move cars to meet each other in a friendly and easy manner, to ease parking problems and to reduce the incidence of traffic-related security cases.
On the other hand, with respect to owners of vehicles who refuse to move, illegally park or obstruct passage, Xian traffic authorities have indicated that the traffic police will then take different measures, depending on the circumstances of the case, and will do so as appropriate.

In conjunction with the building of spiritual civilization, the Commercial Loc Power Company, Tang Fung County, actively organized the event "Emergency in the City of Toyote" and our festival of the 7th of July.
The participating company workers say, "The main energy they usually devote to work and learning, lack of time and a platform to communicate with colleagues, friends... "
"This company has given us such an easy, happy and harmonious platform, which I very much like, meaningful and interesting. "
The 7pm event was widely well received by the youth workers on the scene, and it was hoped that the company would hold more such events in the future and that more youth would be able to communicate and communicate with them.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly published a new edition of the US-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role around the globe.
This was the day when US Secretary of Defense Carter, U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Arida Man-sung and Japanese Defense Secretary Nakagawa attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that the Chinese civilian think tank has published a Japanese military assessment report and the fourth time it has been launched in English.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including general policy adjustments, military strength, defence budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, institutional reform, military training, external military security cooperation, military security relations with China, etc.
According to the report, 2015 was the year in which Abe's Government took office for several consecutive years to advance major policy adjustments in the area of security ...
Since then, Japan ' s initiatives in the area of security will be primarily at the operational level of rule of law, strategy implementation, policy implementation, etc., rather than at the operational level of framework, mechanisms, and significant changes and changes in policies.
The report stresses that Abe's Cabinet is trying to achieve, through the above three-point breakthroughs, the "normal nationalization" of Japan, the departure of the Self-Defence Forces to intervene in international security matters, the strengthening of the Japan-United States Alliance, and the multiplicity of objectives of the anti-Chinese system.
Previously, the China Society for the Promotion of Strategic Culture issued assessments of Japanese military force on 5 June 2012, 19 July 2013, 23 July 2014 and 30 June 2015 ...
The British Financial Times released a set of atlases of the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to China on August 12.
In contrast, according to the article, the United States Ambassador ' s residence, by its appearance, could be considered a safe house in the next film, adapted from John Le Calle ' s Cold War spy novel.
The residence is grey and heavily guarded with perimeter fences, second floor inner walls, barbed wire and vehicle barriers.
Completion of short panels for public sports facilities
The black coal farm warehouse, turned into a football field of green grass, and the red brick-top factory, turned into a modern sports hall.
On National Fitness Day, the South Falling Horse Camp Sports and Culture Park, outside the Gang Gate in Hangzhou, opened the veil of mystery.
This was a coal mine, which was idle after closing for over a decade, leaving a lot of illegal buildings and living garbage.
This has been reformed to become a sports culture park, which will be officially opened to the public in November, offering free sports places to the public, and will undoubtedly create a new fertile ground for sports for all.
This reminds me of the Hangzhou Chen Meng Tsai School, the Chinese poolhouse "Hang Po military school" that has many world champions.
The name of the swimming altar will continue to emerge, interpreting vividly the relationship between competitive sports and sport for all — a rich popular base that provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely linked to the basis of sport for all, which in a sense depends on sport for all, and sport for all depends on the conditions of the site.
It is reported that, as of 2015, our per capita area of sports is 150 times that of the country when the new China was founded, but it is still far behind the sports powers.
In June of this year, the State Council published the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020), which focuses on the development of mass sports.
In order to complete this short sheet, on the one hand, the relevant departments must take fully into account the layout of the stadium in their urban planning.
On the other hand, established public stadiums, including those in schools and others, should be as open and efficient as possible.
The current Rio Olympics, like the flames of fire, inspires movement and awakens a sense of participation.
Gillid got a lawyer's fee in competition with Merk's Hepatitis C patent.
According to the judgment of the U.S. District Judge, Gilled Science is entitled to legal fees arising from patent proceedings for hepatitis C against the U.S. Merk Group, a pharmaceutical company.
In June, following the discovery by United States judges of violations by Merck, including perjury and other immoral acts, Gilled was exempted from payment of $200 million in compensation for two violations of Merk's patents by Sofé Bouvet and Havoni of Gillid's best-selling drugs.
In the proceedings on Thursday, the United States District Judge, Beth Ramberson Freeman, stated that Gillid was not required to bear the costs of the defence.
Merkers is trying to catch up with Gilled Gilled, who rules the new generation of Hepatitis C drug markets, to cure more than 90% of the hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gillid and Merk sued each other, and both claimed to be the active part of Gillid's drug -- the owner of the laboratory work in Sofibwe.
The US-backed forces announced that they had taken Manbitt back from the Islamic State.
On Friday, the spokesman for the force said that all remaining ISIS soldiers in the city had left, and the United States-backed forces had taken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city after the departure of the radicals who have taken refuge in the city.
Sharon Darwish, the ADF-Manbitt Military Committee, told Reuters that they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians abducted by militants.
He told Reuters: "Manbitt is under our control now, but we're still sweeping."
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2 per cent of the federal tax.
Hillary Clinton published his 2105 tax return on Friday, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax.
In 2015, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton's charitable donations amounted to $1 million, the bulk of which went to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speech fees amounted to nearly $5.3 million, while the former Secretary of State earned $3 million from the publishers Simon and Schuster on a book about her work in the State Department.
Clinton's campaign partner, Senator Tim Kane of the Federal State of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, have published a 10-year tax return.
They paid 20.3% of the federal tax in 2015.
In a statement, Clinton ' s campaign assistant, Jennifer Palmieri, said that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane would continue to be the poles of financial transparency ... "
In contrast, Donald Trump concealed and retracted his previous commitment to publish tax returns on false grounds.
Although not required by law, it is customary for United States presidential candidates to make public their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers used the IRS audit as a reason to refuse to publish tax returns.
Bill Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, on Twitter, said you were in charge and attached a link to the Democratic candidate's tax return.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Counsel, Michael Cohen, indicated to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish the tax returns until the audit had been completed.
Critics of Trump, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, and other Republicans, stated that Trump ' s refusal to publish tax returns would raise questions about their net capital, charitable donations, commercial transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
In the wake of the intense criticism of the issue, Clinton released a video on Friday highlighting the high-profile Democrats urging Trump to publish his tax payments.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in a speech on economic policy in Michigan.
She said to people, "For decades, he refused to publish his tax returns like any other presidential candidate."
According to Politicians News Network, in two years in the 1990s, Trump had barely paid a single cent of the tax, and the New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, saying that the situation might still be the same.
Federal taxes have become a major problem in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named Warren Buffett, a billion-dollar investor, a rule that guaranteed at least 30 per cent of taxes for people earning more than $1 million a year.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett says he's also being audited by IRS, and Trump's "fearing" is not a tax authority, but a voter.
The earliest tax returns published by the Clinton campaign team are for 2007.
The average federal tax rate paid by the Clintons, currently residing in Chabak, New York, between 2007 and 2014 amounted to about 32 per cent, and the combined rate was about 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 tax returns of the Clintons show that, unlike most Americans, they earn only $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons' dividends and interest income were $109,000.

The Jewish film producer criticized the Berlin Hotel for removing Israeli phone code -- Reuters News -- according to the Arab client's request.
A French film producer of Jewish origin revealed to the media that the Kebinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli telephone codes and that the hotel staff said that it was in accordance with the Arab client's "request" and that this provoked a public outcry.
Claude Longzman, author of the Holocaust documentary, expressed his disappointment at the Cabinsky Hotel and published an open letter on the "Frankford Report" in Germany.
During his recent stay, Lunzman wanted to find Israel on the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can speak directly from their rooms.
Israel disappeared in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Rantzman wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel via the Call Center at the Cabinsky Hotel.
In an attempt to find an explanation, the film producer asked about the hotel's front desk.
In his letter, Lontzmann said that he was shocked by the answers he received from the front desk.
The hotel people say it's "a deliberate decision by the manager of the Cabinsky Hotel."
And the reason for this is to make the film producer angry.
Rantzman quotes the employee: most of our guests are Arabs, and they ask for Israel ' s code to be deleted ... "
According to the Nande daily, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas Handelsmann, called this a "surprising insult".
We were surprised to hear about it.
This is a great shame in itself.
And what happened in Germany and that hotel chain is a disgrace.
There's no need to explain this.
"We want the hotel to come to the right conclusion," said the officer.
This incident has sparked much debate on the Internet, and we all think it's a scandal.
Some think that the Cabinsky Hotel is simply "bow-down" to meet the demands of Arab clients.
Another post refers directly to the hotel, "What a shame," and states that this street on the famous Kudam Street is near a synagogue.
According to the Sunglasses Weekly, the hotel quickly clarified all the charges, claiming that everything was "neglect" and expressing its apologies to Lanceman.
The Nande daily quotes Kebinski: "There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the rapid dial-up list."
The newspaper also states that Israeli code has been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to drive out the protesting Brazilian students.
On Thursday, in São Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with the police in protest against the reform of the Government ' s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters.
The reason for the incident was that law enforcement officials tried to disperse the students, and the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the march and expressed their dissatisfaction with the programmes.
In an effort to save money, the Governor of São Paulo, Oakmin, plans to close 100 public schools, and 300,000 students will be transferred.
Some of the students participating in the protest expressed their dissatisfaction with interim President Michel Temel through graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before a recent protest, protesters collectively took to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the National Senate.
The Scottish biker, Kalm Skinner, won the medal of the bike.
The Scottish bicycle rider, Kalm Skinner, last night at the Rio bike races of men's races helped the British trio to organize the successful Olympic medals after the 2012 London Olympics.
The 23-year-old Glasgow biker who replaced his fellow Scottishman, Sir Chris Hoy, became the backbone of the team.
Four years ago, the British team was amazing, and Hoys took the fifth of a man's six Olympic gold medals.
The British team was ranked sixth in the March London World unicycle championship, and Hoy has since retired, and then the British team is brilliant again.
During the Beijing Olympics to London, the problem with the British team was to replace Jamie Staff.
That's what the convoy did when Schindler showed up.
Hoy's retirement also left a gap, and Gene Emady and Matt Clapton both wanted to fill it.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's coaches insisted that he be elected to the national team, and Skinner eventually didn't fall short of expectations.
Skinner's partner was Schindler and Kenny, who won the gold medal with Hoy four years ago, who updated the Olympics' records in the qualifying competition, but this was overtaken by the New Zealand team in the first round.
And these three British bicycles finally beat their opponent and won the gold medal.
Although Schinds is a little behind, Kenny is leading the team, and Skinner is holding this lead to the end.
The change of strategy is the key to this reversal, and Schindler chose the larger flying wheels, so it's slower, which allows Kenny, especially Skinner, to maintain the speed.
Hoys watched the game as a BBC commentator.
Twenty-three-year-old Glasgow biker Skinner said, "It's flattering me."
I'm just doing everything I can to make myself famous.
We made the Olympics in the finals and beat the world champion.
This is unbelievable.
There's nothing better than this victory.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 London Olympics, Schindler admitted to falling deliberately on the track in a bad start.
Later, he withdrew his comments, and the British team's opponents were unable to appeal.
And this victory has no such problems.
"It's like in London, where all the stations are British flags."
We just formed a team three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world champions, so it's amazing to be able to defend Olympic champions.
It's just a game, a gold medal, for the 7-dollar British team that won the 10-site bicycle medal at the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, we will continue to succeed in the bicycle hall for the next five days.
According to Kenny's state, it's not impossible for him to repeat the three gold medals he won at an Olympics.
If that were the case, Behoi, 12 years old, and also on March 23rd, would be born with six gold medals and one silver medal.
This score is the same as that of Hoy.
Kenny's next battle begins today, with a three-day race.
The 28-year-old Bolton said, "I'm going to focus on this game for the time being.
Team games are always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly, it's a little lonely for one to win.
Schindler said, "If he gets two other gold medals, he'll be awarded a jazz seal."
It was the only game that had won a medal that day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wilkins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doyle were promoted to the 4-km group with the fastest grades.
Their grades are 351.943.
The 2012 London Olympic gold medal winner's world record is 351.659.
The first and finals will be held today in the second race, and Wilkins will undoubtedly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday he had an argument with the competition officer before the qualification, who gave him the height test.
Laura Trot, Joanna Rosell Chand, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archibald from Milgay were promoted to the new world record of 413.260.
The British team, relying on its powerful field bicycle team, took the initiative and won many medals in the middle of the Olympics.
After displaying its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British bikers were a little disappointed in their journey to Rio.
There were many swings during the period, including the resignation of Technical Director Sean Sutton in April on allegations of gender discrimination and bullying, and the retirement of legends such as Hoy, Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night of the bike house is proof of the legend that the British team will once again rise to the peak of a critical moment.
When little lives come to this world, parents are responsible not only for their children's physical health, but also for their spiritual development, which is education.
If you fail in the education of your children, then even if you succeed in your career, it will not make up for the lack of life, the failure of your family.
When a new life arrives, the new parents will need time and energy to look after and educate their children and be responsible for him.
And responsible, in addition to caring for the body and making it healthy, is spiritual education, which is how children learn how to be human, how to be adult, how to succeed.
Good family education means that parents need to accompany their children on a regular basis, to care for them, to be patient, to teach them to behave in a civilized manner, to learn better and to improve their intelligence.
A parent's words and actions affect the child's development, and they imitate their parents, as they say, the dragons, the phoenix, the mouse's son, the father's and the child's.
So parents need to set a good example in front of their children, shape their words and deeds, develop their own good qualities, which indirectly help them shape good hearts and make them better.
Amy's a smart, beautiful girl.
She's very active, able to get along well with her friends, and able to adapt to the environment.
But Amy had a little secret in her heart: she couldn't focus for long on what she was going to do, what she was doing.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time.
Even with fragmented, modular time to learn and work, she can basically accomplish her tasks and achieve good results.
But when the task is heavy and the time is tight, Amy feels very painful and painful.
The resistance of individuals to self-exploitation and their emotional experiences is aimed at not putting their self-awareness and self-esteem at risk.
There are also behavioral psychologists who interpret resistance as an insubordination of individuals to correct their behavior.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise to calm herself down and feel the pain.
And once she left that trapped situation, she felt relaxed and regained her freedom.

Uber entered the Taiwan market for four years, which had a considerable impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
On August 12, the Taiwan Joint News reported that more than 100 taxis had bypassed Taiwan's Administrative Court in the morning to protest, causing serious traffic paralysis in the surrounding area.
However, the Governor of the Taipei City Drivers' Union, Jung Liqah, said that Uber had been on the stage for four years, that the authorities had only met at the end of the month and that the drivers could no longer wait.
But the government won't believe it.

Original title: 2,000 chickens from the Jiangsu I farm who were arrested by the court and sold without permission
After the judgement came into force, Wang sought enforcement from the court in Xiaoyang because Li failed to comply automatically with his obligations as determined by the judgement.
On 16 October 2014, the court of Xiaoyang issued a civil decision in which it ruled that the 2000 eggs and chickens in one of Li ' s farms should be seized and not transferred without permission.
After receiving an arrest decision, Li-Xiao sold some of the eggs held in the farm without the permission of the court of Xiaoyang.
As of March 8, 2015, at the time of the survey by the Xiaoyang County Public Security Department, there were only 142 eggs and chickens in the farm.

No one shall use the Beijing Olympic Committee emblem for commercial purposes without the permission of the Beijing Olympic Committee.
The head of the Industry Coordination Division of the National Development Reform Commission pointed out here today that overcapacity in steel is a global problem.
In recent years, our capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average and higher than in countries and regions such as the United States and Europe.
We have taken resolute and effective measures to address excess capacity, and the results are gradually being realized.
The head noted that the Party ' s Central State Department attached great importance to the global problem of excess iron and steel production.
All sectors, regions and regions are actively following up on the deployment of the State Council and are working hard to reduce crude steel production by about 45 million tons this year.
In view of our national circumstances, we do not encourage the export of steel, but rather take a series of practical measures to control the export of steel.
The Officer-in-Charge emphasized that international trade in iron and steel products was essentially market-based and derived from the needs of importing countries, and that consumers had chosen to take into account factors such as value for money for products.
The implementation of trade protection measures will not help to address the root causes of the development of the global steel industry, but will, on the contrary, only further impact on the international trade order.
Turning to debt, the Officer-in-Charge stressed that debt resolution was an important issue that needed to be properly addressed in the process of resolving excess capacity.
Because of the size and scope of the assets of the steel industry, the complex debt relationships of some enterprises may give rise to regional risks if not disposed of properly.
According to the head of the department, in recent years, as the downward pressure on the economy has increased, aggregate social demand has gradually diminished, productivity in some sectors has declined, and production and operations in enterprises have become more difficult.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changing market environment and are unable to sustain or even close down their production operations, but are constrained by a number of institutional factors that create more barriers to market-based exit and become "zombie enterprises".
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces factor resource efficiency, increases social management costs and impedes the establishment of a level playing field.
The main causes of the loss are the same as the global iron and steel industry — weak market demand and low capacity utilization.
The main approach in the country is market mechanisms, economic instruments and the rule of law, and the Government is primarily working to ensure a fair and equitable market order by working for workers and social stability.
The Officer-in-Charge stressed that the next step would be to stay firm and keep up with the ability to produce and ensure that the five-year target of 100 million to 150 million tons of rough steel can be addressed.
In the afternoon, as soon as the Chinese tourist police opened their eyes at the Red Square in Moscow, attention was drawn to the fact that Chinese tourists waved with surprises and that local and foreign tourists could not stop visiting.
On the same day, members of the tourism police unit of the Sanya City Public Security Bureau of Hainan Province, the first professional tourist police force in China, came to the Red Square in Moscow and studied with the local tourism police on duty.
The Moscow Tourist Police are on patrol in three teams at Redfield, Nikoliski Walking Street, Gum Department store, and the Chinese Tourist Police are studying together. The process lasted more than an hour.
Policewoman Lucinne, in her 20s, knows English and Spanish, just joined the Tourist Police last year.
On his way, he carefully observed what the Russian colleague said and did, and he interacted with her from time to time.
When Spanish tourists came for advice, the Moscow Tourist Police gave each other a patient explanation in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Ice.
"Moscow Tourist Police, each of whom knows a foreign language and some more than two, has touched us very much... "
" Hainan, as an international tourist island, is giving increasing attention to attracting international tourists, and we want to improve our ability to match the status of international tourism islands ... "
On the same day, the Chinese Tourism Police went to Moscow City Tourist Police Station to interact with their Russian counterparts before following their studies.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists, and I am very happy to see them travel to Russia. "
"The question they usually ask is how they walk, where a monument is, how they rent it, how they get back to the hotel... "
The head of the Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade, Resakov, said that the urban environment and the tourist climate in Moscow had become more and more favourable in recent years and attracted more and more foreign tourists.
In response to tourism development needs, a tourism police force was set up in July 2014 to patrol and secure major attractions and assist and channel tourists.
At present, all Moscow tourist police officers are proficient in English and, in part, in Spanish and German.
The police force divides them into nine teams according to the level of foreign languages, taking two classes a week to learn self-defense techniques, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
"There are two tourist policemen who are now learning Chinese, and they're doing well, and we're going to continue to raise their standards in Chinese," says Rezakov.
Rezakov told journalists that the Moscow Tourist Police had gained some experience since its formation, hoping to inspire Sanya's peers.
In his view, cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police services would enhance the sense of security of citizens travelling to each other's countries.
"Moscow Tourist Police personnel, police models, equipment and good interaction with tourists have inspired us, says Chen Xiaokun.
Chinese and new Internet journalists have found that at least nine provinces and cities, including Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing, have issued regulations for the implementation of residence permits.
With regard to the conditions for obtaining a residence permit, it is generally suggested that the requirement of more than six months of residence is one of the conditions of legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence and continuous schooling.
Chinese and Chinese online journalists have noted that the range of public services and facilities provided in some areas has expanded in comparison with the national editions of the various "golds" in terms of the treatment provided by residence permits.
These areas have increased the facilities available to children to participate in the local upper secondary examinations under the relevant conditions ...
In addition, many places, including Beijing, have clearly called for the progressive expansion of the provision of public services and facilities and their regular disclosure to society ...
For example, Fujian proposes that the scope of public services and facilities available to the holder of a residence permit be made public to society at least once every three years ...
The Provisional Ordinance on Residence Permits stipulates that the public security organs shall produce and issue a residence permit within 15 days of the date on which the residence permit is processed.
With regard to the time frame for the issuance of certificates, most regions agree with the national version, i.e., within 15 days.
Hebei makes it clear that a residence permit shall be issued within three working days from the date of receipt of the complaint by the police station of the place of residence, provided that the information is complete.
Jiangxi stipulates that the public security organs shall produce and issue a residence permit within five working days of the date on which the application for a residence permit is processed if it meets the requirements for obtaining a residence permit and the certificate is fully documented.
In accordance with the provisions of the Temporary Ordinance on Residence Permits, all the above-mentioned areas have expressly applied for a residence permit for the first time and are exempt from the payment of the fee for the work of a certified worker.
For example, Sichuan requires that authorized fee lines and rates be strictly enforced at local public security police stations or commissioned community services, and that any over-extension, over-standard charge or hitchhiking be firmly prohibited.
On 27 July 2016, Chen Yangxia, former Secretary of State Committee for Dingnan County, reported to the Provincial Disciplinary Committee as head of the Party Party ' s Parliamentary Control Unit (in the rank of Deputy Director for a trial period of one year).
The wine you drank that night was provided by Li Yu personally, and the rest was paid by someone else.
The Jiangxi Provincial Disciplinary Committee reported that Chen Yangxia, Cheng Ziqiang and others had organized and accepted an invitation at a private meeting, in violation of the eight rules of the Central Committee and in violation of the Party ' s discipline.
Borgba ate two yellow cards in the Italian cup last season and automatically banned one game according to the rules.
Even though he's back in England, he's still pushing his accumulated ban on the English Super.
So, in the August 14 guest fight against Bernmouth, Borgba will watch the wall, and his return to the League's premiere will be extended until the 20th match with Southampton.
As the first round of the 12th new show in 2014, Saric will officially land on the NBA next season and join the 76th team in Philadelphia.
As a young European player, many fans didn't know him well, but through the Olympics, it was believed that Sarić's performance was very impressive.
Last time in the Croatian race to Spain, Saric managed to seal off Paul Gazor's attempt to drag the race into the add-on basket.
In recent days, the Commander of the 76th Brigade, Bret Brown, has given a very high profile to Sarić, who is believed to have seen the shadow of Manu Ginobiri in his youth.
Apparently, Saric has shown his talent and has made 76 people look forward to him.
In the first two competitions in Croatia at this Olympic Games, Sarić received 24 points, 17 baskets and 12 reinforcements.
In the first half of the game, Saric showed his ability to open up space in his presence, and after breaking through his teammates, he was shot out of a three-point line.
Although the 76 people are currently hoarding a lot of talented young players, they do not have the outer power of Sarić.
From caps to long-range rapid attacks and completion of the offensive, there are only a few insiders who can do that in the NBA field today.
Since the beginning of the Olympic Games, Sarić has received 13 points in each of the three games, eight baskets and five reinforcements, with a complete performance.
Since the decision to return to the Knights in the summer of 2014, James has signed two successive contracts of one plus one.
As NBA enters its final year, James will be at the forefront of collective agreement negotiations as Vice President of the NBA Staff Council.
In view of the significant increase in the Alliance's revenues, thanks to the new television transmission agreement and the fight between the boss and the players over how to deal with this money, there's a fear that the NBA will stop next summer.
But for James, he doesn't have to worry about being a free player next summer, because he's renewed a three-year contract with the Knights.
No matter when the 2017-18 season starts, James is in the contract.
Since the iPhoneSE stunned, the mobile phone market has also hit the tide of a small screen.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched its first work in the Z11 series: nubiaZ11mini.
Nubia Z11mini has continued its usual excellent photo genetics and has been equipped with a 5.0-inch screen with easier hands to hold, easy-to-use back-to-print identification, which has led to an extraordinary experience of use.
The nubia-flagged little screen camera phone Z11mini, just listed, dropped by $200 from the original $1499 to $1,299.
In terms of appearance, nubia Z11mini uses a 5-inch 1080-P screen, which is still the classic "Red Circle" design on the front.
The middle frame is the metal material and the bottom is symmetrically designed and configured for the Type-C data interface.
The future of Portland Smelter is fraught with uncertainty due to the cancellation of the power contract.
As the power company that supplied the plant revealed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract, thereby rendering all supply contracts ineffective, the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria and hundreds of factory workers are now facing an uncertain future.
This initiative took place after the Victorian government decided not to continue paying subsidies for the operation of the guaranteed plant.
This 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
Two thousand workers at the Aluminium Company Portland factory are likely to be unemployed.
As soon as the factory closes down, up to 2,000 people may be unemployed, directly or indirectly.
And since the plant has about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity output, it may also have a chain reaction.
In 2014, Aluminum shut down the Hanley Corner Smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesi power plant last year.
The Aluminum company Portland Smelter is currently losing and at risk of closure.
This was done after projections of the plant for the coming years, initially because of the strong Australian dollar and, more recently, because of the price of the factory ' s products.
AGL provides power to this large aluminium smelter through the old Eryan power plant in the Rutloub Valley. The company predicts that the owners of the other three plants will terminate their agreement.
The largest shareholders in the plant were a joint venture between USA and Aluminium Oxide, while China’s Sino-China group and Japan’s Maroon Society also held small shares.
According to the joint venture, "AGL expects that the Portland plant will continue to operate, meaning that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand. "
AGL states that these contracts were "squilling contracts" that should have been in effect since November 2016.
The period of termination of the contracts is 12 months and they will therefore be terminated in 2017.
The company said, "So, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue for the 2017 fiscal year."
Any potential revenue impact on AGL since 2018 is currently being viewed positively by futures markets for bulk electricity prices.
AGL states that the company has written down $187 million in contract value in "termination expectations".
Aluminium stated that the decision to terminate the contracts "will not affect the ability of Aluminium to operate the smelter or to secure its electricity supply".
The United States company indicated that it had signed a 20-year contract with the old Eyan in 2010, which would have entered into force in November of this year, but that it had not explained why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle will close down because of the bad economic situation in the industry.
In response to the analyst's comments earlier this week, the AGL operator, Steven Michaelson, stated that Portland had about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and the Tomago plant about 900 megawatts per year.
If two factories close down, the demand for electricity markets will be greatly reduced.
He said, "As an electricity company, it's not good news for us."
One hundred and sixty thousand people are denied access to community law centres every year.
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are denied access to community law centres every year.
In Queensland, three out of five people are denied free legal advice and representation, most of them older persons, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to confront unfair evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and is now facing further funding cuts.
Since June of next year, federal funding for these legal centres will be reduced by a further 30 per cent.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Centre, stated that according to the latest report of the National Community Association Law Centre, thousands of people are denied access every year.
Mr. Farrell said that the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change the existing decisions.
He said, "The community law centre in Queensland is chronically under-funded, which means that thousands of people will not be able to access the essential services they need."
Those who need to stay away from violence, those who bear huge debts that cannot be repaid, those who face broken families, squeezed workers, those who face problems at the legal level, and the report shows that they are unable to obtain the help they need.
The federal government will cut another 30 per cent from June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to face complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately rescind these cuts so that people can get the help they need when facing legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Attention must now be paid to community law centres and their responsiveness to the needs of the community, and the government of Blanche must be invested in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team is being prosecuted for pulling their guns.
New York: Trump's campaign team was indicted for not acting after the head of Northern California had pulled a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, former software trainer for the state campaign team, described the incident on Wednesday in the state court in Charlotte.
Bodini said he wanted this to be resolved internally, but after months of waiting, he realized that "it can't happen."
According to Bodini's description, the head of the man named Earl Phillips pulled out a pistol, put his right index finger on the plate and pointed his gun at Vincent's kneebone. "
Having complained to the leadership of the local and regional electoral teams, Bodini learned from the file that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
Bodini, in his complaint, said, "Do not shoot does not cause harm. "
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate in North Carolina told the public that if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and selected the judge she loved, then "the second amendment" - that is, the gun holder and the gun lover - might act, and that speech provoked outrage.
Trump's campaign team said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he did not advocate violence.
Bodini, in his complaint, demanded that the campaign team pay compensation for his negligence and also that Philip pay compensation for his assault, beatings and psychological harm.
The Trump spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to this information.
No contact with Philip.
According to WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, Philip recently left the campaign team.
His consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services did not respond to calls immediately.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign team is controversial.
In this case, the parties are the Presidential Election Corporation of Bodini and Trump, 16-CS-14300, General Division of the High Court of Mecklenburg County (Charlott).
The United Kingdom must deliver the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport.
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, to London and to the country as a whole.
For me, it's Heathrow's charm, as we did at the 2012 London Olympics to ensure that our countries and regions could benefit from these events.
The Olympics will benefit Stratford and the East Side.
And by creating opportunities for local people and businesses around Heathrow to benefit the region once again.
For our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and free the young people around the airport from unemployment.
As in the run-up to the 2012 London Olympics, some think Heathrow's expansion is too large.
I was told that Britain will not be able to prepare for the Olympics and that we will be humiliated in front of the world.
Doubters are wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and their doubts about the Heathrow project will also prove wrong.
Although there are always obstacles to overcome, Heathrow is solving every problem he faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not a few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and generate £211 billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of technology and employment around the airport and throughout Britain.
We have an excellent Heathrow team, which has completed 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment on time and within budget, including the T5 terminal, which was elected for five consecutive years as the world's best airport terminal, and the T2 terminal, which is located between the two of the world's busiest runways.
Now, they're going to build the third runway with 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The United Kingdom successfully organized the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe the Heathrow airport expansion project will be a great success.
This is a good time for us to pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow airport so that we can protect our future and create a technological and employment wealth that makes Britain proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Heathrow Airport Board of Directors and former Business Counsellor of the British Treasury.
A woman killed herself on the Swiss highway.
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to kill herself was run over by several cars on the highway in the morning of Thursday.
The accident occurred on the A1 highway near Morgee, Vaud, on Thursday morning.
According to the Vaud State police, a woman was lying on the road "dry" at night and was run over by a number of cars.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman with a clear intent to commit suicide.
This woman died instantly.
The police have revealed that several of the drivers involved have been investigated, but some of them have still not been confirmed.
According to the Geneva Tribune, a criminal investigation has now been initiated, according to Mr. Gilles Hovenstein, which is the normal course of events of this kind.
But it's not yet known if the pilot will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
"It's up to the prosecutor to determine."
Based on the results of two other similar cases in the last five years, the driver will not be responsible.
According to the newspaper, both cases were caused by people walking on the freeway late in the night, and the final verdict was that the driver could not have expected a pedestrian to cross the freeway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was accused of negligent deaths in August 2014, when she hit and killed a man on the A1 highway near Payena.
The court was told that the 22-year-old victim passed the road after drinking.
After the investigation, the judge stated that the driver of the police officer was completely legal, that the man was on the road "unfortunately and unexpectedly" and that the police officer called the emergency number afterwards.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near Morse on Thursday should call 021,644,8346 or 021,644,4444 to contact the police.
NASA Climate Model: Altitude for human habitation on Venus
According to NASA's prediction of a new climate model, Venus used to be suitable for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA Goddard Space Research have developed a model that explores the past of Venus and uses very similar tools and algorithms to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether the surface temperature, the waterless and the atmosphere's carbon dioxide-filled Venus has ever had an environment similar to the Earth.
Previously, scientists thought that Venus was slow to spin because its atmosphere was thicker.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thinner atmosphere similar to the Earth and was also slow to rotate at that time.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
Venus may be dryer than Earth, but there was enough water and geographic change to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early on, the light on Venus was 30% darker than the Earth.
At a press conference, Anthony Del Genio, scientist at the Godard Space Research Institute, explained: "In a model simulation at the Godard Space Research Institute, Venus slowly rotates its side of the day for almost two months. "
It warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds that block most of the sun's heat like an umbrella.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually a few degrees lower than the Earth today.
The model simulated the evolution of Venus in close proximity to what former planetary scientists had assumed.
Although life may have existed on Venus, it was exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet light over billions of years.
The ocean on the planet evaporates and the water steam burns out of ultraviolet light.
With the escape of hydrogen, only the thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and the deadly greenhouse gas effect have been left, forming the Venus that we know today.
Researchers published simulations of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Newsletter.
Patrick Roy resigned as Chief of the avalanche team.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from his position as coach and vice-president of the Colorado avalanche hockey team, stating that he had no say in the team ' s decision-making.
Joe Sachs, Managing Director of the Executive Vice-President of Colorado, confirmed the news and said that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
In a statement, 50-year-old Roy said, "In the last three years, I've been living up to my responsibilities as coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche team. "
I've been thinking hard all summer about how to improve this team and make it more powerful.
To that end, the goals of the coach and vice president must be consistent with those of the club.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
But for now, these conditions have not been met.
Sachs hired Roy on 23 May 2013 to thank Roy for his contribution to the team.
Satchise said, "Patrick told me his decision today."
We thank him for his contribution to the club, and we hope that he will be well in the future.
Roy was nominated as the best coach of the Jack Adams Awards for the first season of the Avalanche Academy in 2013-14.
He helped the club get 112 points, number one in the middle, but the Colorado team was eliminated from the Minnesota team in the first round of the post-season race and lost its hand in the last two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the avalanche team won 39, 39, 4 times 4 and eventually lost its second card from the Western Great League.
Roy won four Stanley Cups as a celebrity watchman and two for the Canadians and the avalanche in Montreal.
North Sea oilfield workers stopped the strike and continued the negotiations.
The chief negotiator said that workers in the North Sea oil fields had stopped the wage strike and that the parties to the dispute had begun a new round of negotiations.
There were several strikes on the North Sea oil platform operated by the Dutch Royal Shell against the oil company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute resolution process."
We will start early next week with a number of full-day meetings in the coming weeks to revisit these issues.
The trade union indicated that its recent action was to protest the possibility of a 30 per cent salary reduction, which was the first action taken by the union in 25 years.
Wood Group has reduced North Sea contractors' remuneration by about 9% this year due to market pressure.
Prior to this pay cut, the company reduced the remuneration of the marine contractor by 10 per cent in 2014.
The company said that a further salary cut would help the company survive the depression.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because of the company ' s need to streamline its operations following its merger with the British Energy Corporation ' s British Gas Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices and the British de-European decision of June.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute of the North Sea generation.
He said that the North Sea was vital to the region ' s economy.
In his statement, Dave said, "In the North Sea and in the country as a whole, we need an economy that serves the majority, not a few."
In 2016, new North Sea projects are expected to spend no more than $1.4 billion, while the average project expenditure for the past five years has reached approximately $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of the stars of the Orion.
The latest mission of the Caper Space Telescope has helped astronomers to capture the most complete velocity of the Orion cluster.
New data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the constellation have different rotation speeds and how the cycle is connected to the planet.
In a press conference, Luza Rebur, research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the Pasadena Institute of Technology, stated: "We want to understand the relationship between the mass of stars, their age, and even the history of their solar systems by comparing our results with other clusters. "
The Orchestra is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are now just reaching adulthood.
They've reached the highest rotation rate in their lives.
At the highest rotation speed, these mature stars emit large amounts of star wind.
When these stars wind through the magnetic field of the stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.
As the age of stars increases, their rotation starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time of the appearance of an identifiable star's black child (like the sun's black son).
The latest spin-rate data sets indicate that larger stars are moving slower than smaller stars.
Rabel compares stars to dancers, and larger dancers rotate at a slower pace than smaller dancers.
Rabel says, "In the Ballet Show of the Orchestra, we find that slowly moving stars tend to be of greater mass, while the fastest moving stars are often the lightest stars."
Because of the proximity of the Orchestra, it can be the ideal cosmology laboratory for comparing star mass and rotation speed.
Rabel says, "The Orchestra has laid the foundation for a two-way rotation theory model for young and old stars."
We still have a lot of knowledge to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spins and "take up their shoes."
Rabel and her colleagues have elaborated on their latest analysis of the speed of the Astrology Group in three new papers, which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
The Chief of the Water Management Section of South Lake Park, Cheng Jianjun, explained that the bottom of the South Lake is more than 10 metres deep and that people who do not know the water under the circumstances are likely to be in danger.
"Although the South Lake Rescue Team is very professional, it is hoped that the vast number of rowing tourists will wear life jackets, refrain from illegal actions on the lake and play safely ... "
Surrounded villages have a unique marine environment and are host to two major recreational tourism resources, natural and human.
" However, the individual owners who purchased the spaces in the area, fearing that this would affect the rental price of their spaces, and suspected that others were self-inflicted, continued to sabotage their backs, resulting in the renovation of the spaces being put on hold... "
There is still a diversity of views on when the potatoes are introduced by whom.
In the prevailing view, the introduction of cassava has three main lines.
The most influential of the three routes introduced by the cassava, and the most widely distributed, is that Chen Zhenlong was introduced by the Philippines into Fuzhou.
The Beijing Municipal Office for the Management of Social Groups will be carrying out a special inspection of the use of the unified receipts of social groups ' contributions as of that date.
Inspections are conducted on a unit-by-unit basis and on a case-by-case basis.
The head of the municipal association office explained that the scope of the inspection included the provision of a unified receipt for membership in the municipal association for the period 2013-2015.
In its 20'2 Olympic communication strategy, the Rio Olympic Committee said, "The success of the Olympic Games is defined by those who share stories in social media."
And from the coverage of the Olympic Games, the media have changed much more than before in terms of modes of communication, product patterns, language styles, news perspectives.
The IOC and media practitioners from all over the world seem to have come to terms with this round of challenges.
On August 11, Gwang Da Securities H entered the last day of the open sale.
According to a domestic certificater analyst, Eastern securities are not good on the port base, and management of business under the flag is the chief Eastern Officer.
The experts noted that, as securities markets returned to a low level since the beginning of the year, the performance of many coupons had declined, but that it could not be said in general terms that the company ' s own business would have to look more at the development of the company ' s own business when it was listed.
With this new regulation, Suzhou will be the first second-line city in the country to reopen the buyout.
Second-line cities that have or are about to have a city management policy are not just Suzhou, but also Yutsu, Nanjing and others.
Prior to that, Humpty had taken the lead in issuing a loan-restrictive policy, and banks would refuse to provide mortgage services to home buyers who had two flats under the same name and had an open housing loan.
