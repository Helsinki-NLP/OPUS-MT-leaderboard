The Welsh Congressman was worried that he looked like a puppet.
Some of the senators were dismayed by the suggestion to change their designation to MWPs.
This is because it is planned to change the name of Parliament to the Welsh Assembly.
Councillors from all political factions are worried about the possibility of making fun of them.
A Labour Congressman said that his organization was concerned that "it's going to have a Pwp rhyme with Twp."
For readers other than Wales: twp in Welsh means stupid, pwp means poop.
A Welsh congressman said that the organization was "unhappily" and offered an alternative.
A Welsh conservative said that his organization was open-minded about changing its name, but pointed out that the MWP to the puppets were a short road.
In these languages, the Welsh letter w is pronunciation similar to that of the Yorkshire letteru.
The committee is currently drafting legislation to introduce a name change and states: " The final decision on any description of a member of the council is, of course, the decision of the member ... "
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the committee released the results of a public consultation on the proposal, which found broad public support for calling the council the Welsh Assembly.
With regard to the title of the congressman, the committee is oriented towards the Welsh congressman or WMPs, but MWP has received the most support in public consultations.
The congressman obviously suggested it, but it was hard to get the consensus that might be a headache for Congress President Erin Jones, who was expected to submit draft legislation on change in a few weeks.
Legislation on reform will include changes to the working methods of the Council, including rules for the removal of membership and the design of a committee system.
In debating the legislative process, the senators will take a final decision on what they should be called.
The Macedonians are putting a national referendum on changing the name of the country.
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of the country to "North Macedonia."
A referendum was set up to resolve the decades-long dispute with the neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbour represents its territory and repeatedly opposes its accession to the European Union and the North Treaty.
President Georgiinov of Macedonia was the opposition to the change of name vote, and he said he wouldn't give a damn about the vote.
But, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's supporters of the referendum, the change of name is only a price to pay for joining the European Union and the North Treaty.
The bells of St. Martin's church were silenced in the Harlem church battle.
Mr. Adams said, "From history, there's a bar with a church in every corner of the old man's speech I've spoken to."
"And home, both of them are gone."
He said it was understandable that the bar disappeared.
And he said, "The way family socializes is gone."
"The bar is no longer a community living room where everyone will go."
As for the Church, it's afraid that the money sold will not last as long as the leaders expect, "they will return to where they started."
It adds that the church may be replaced by an apartment building full of people who don't want to help the rest of the neighborhood.
"Most of the people who buy apartments in these buildings are white, "He says," so the churches will close fast, because most people who move into apartments are not likely to be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan area in 1870, while St. Martin's church was 10 years later.
The original white councilman moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that's been doing church service around here has taken ownership of the building.
The black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Jensen took over the Church of St. Martin and led a campaign against the 125th Street retailer, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but when Father Jensen's parish residents developed the reconstruction plan, they commissioned the clock.
Father Jensen, the successor to St. Martin's Church, Reverend David Jensen, is proud to call this the "Clock of the Poor".
The experts who played the clock in July also called it "Culture Treasure" and "Indefensible Historic Instruments".
This Tiffany Ng expert at the University of Michigan also pointed out that this was the first big clock in the world played by a black musician, Dionycio A. Lindh, who moved to the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's church did not replace it.
In the past few months, the Church of St. Martin has had a complicated story about architects and contractors, led by secular church leaders, and brought by Anglican parishes.
The parish committee is made up of secular leaders - in July it wrote to the parish, worried that the parish "will transfer the fee" to the parish council, even though the parish council has not been involved in the construction and contractors of the denominational church.
Some of them complain about the lack of transparency in the parish.
A 13-year-old boy in California was bitten by a shark while diving for lobster.
Officially, on Saturday, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for lobster on the opening of the California lobster season.
The attack took place before 7 a.m., near the Beach of Becken in Ensientas.
Chad Hammel spoke to KSWB TV in San Diego, who was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy cry out for help and then sailed with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
He said he thought he was only excited to catch lobster, but then he realized he was yelling, "I got bitten!
I got bitten!
His whole clavicle was torn open, "Hammer said, he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I told everyone to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' "Hamel added.
The boy was flown to the Reddy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was classified as critical.
The shark species that caused this attack are unknown.
At the press launch, Lifeguard Captain Larry Jarth said that a shark had been found a few weeks ago in the area, but was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim was injured in the upper part of his body.
For investigative and security purposes, the 48-hour passage from Punto Beach in Casablanca to Swamy Beach in Esinitas has been officially closed.
Giles points out that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The Seinesbury Company plans to march into the British beauty market.
The Seinesbury Company is competing with Bozi, Super Pharmacy and Debenham to set up a department store-style beauty tunnel, a professional assistant.
As part of the qualitative push for the British beauty market of £2.8 billion, the market continues to grow at the same time as the sale of fashion and household goods returns, and the larger beauty shelf will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and if proven successful, it will be in more stores next year.
While investing in beauty, supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space of the formerly sued TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Seensbury said it would double its beauty products to 3,000, including the brands of Louvre, Essy, Dixieman and Dr. Pumpkin.
Olya, the existing product series of Mabelian and Bees will also be given more space, with brand areas similar to those of shops like Bozi.
Supermarkets will re-launch the series of fine cosmetics so that most of the products are vegetarian-friendly -- and this is the demand of a growing number of young buyers.
In addition, the perfume retailer's fragrance store will operate on a licensed basis at two shops in Seinesbury, the first of which opened last week in Cleden, south of London, and the second in Birmingham in the second half of this year in Selina Oak.
The transformation of online shopping and the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more work to convince visitors to visit.
The Chief Executive Officer of Seansbury, Mike Cooper, said that as the chain supermarket tried to counter the discounts with more services and non-food, Aldie and Lidel would become more and more like a department store.
Since the purchase of these two chains two years ago, Cynsbury has been setting up the Agos Olythes store in hundreds of stores, and has brought in a few properties, and the company has said that it has facilitated the sale of the grocery store, making it more profitable.
The supermarket failed in its attempts to transform beauty and pharmacy.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Seinsbury tried to establish a joint venture with Bozi, but there was a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds of Bozi stores in supermarkets, and the cooperation between the two parties ended.
Three years ago, Cynsbury sold 281 of its Pharmacy Stores at a price of 125 million pounds to the owner of the Pyloyd's Pharmacy.
He said that Lloyd would play a part in the project by adding a series of luxury skin brands to the four shops, including LaRish Springs and Vizzy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, head of business at Seansbury, says, "We've changed the look and feel of beauty corridors to improve the environment of our clients.
We've also hired trained colleagues to give advice at any time.
Our brand series is designed to satisfy the needs, the attractive environment and the convenience that means that our home is an attractive destination for beauty, challenging the old way of shopping. "
Peter Jones, after the 11 million quid deal out of Holly Willoughby, "breathed angry."
After the TV show host Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million quid deal in his lifestyle brand business, focusing on a new contract with Martha's Plumbing and independent television, the dragon cave star, Peter Jones, left.
Willoughby has no time for their domestic clothing and accessories branded Truley.
Their business was once compared to Gwyneth Patro's Xupu.
The 37-year-old host of "Tomorrow" announced on Instagram that he would leave.
At the last minute, Holly Willoughby withdrew from their lucrative lifestyle branding business, focusing on a new insurance contract with Martha's people and independent television, which set the dragon cave star Peter Jones on fire.
It has been reported that on Tuesday, at an intense meeting in Malo, Buckingham County, the women of television reputation admitted that their new contract, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that they would not have enough time to go into their home-dressing brand of Truley, and Jones was "excused."
This business is considered to double Willough's wealth of about £11 million compared to the Gwyneth Patro brand.
When a 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would leave Truley, Jones flew out of England and went to a vacation house.
It's said, "To date, Trurie is Holly's top priority.
This will be its long-term future, and it will be seen in the next few decades.
The decision to quit was a shock to everyone.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday. It's too close to the market.
Marlows has a warehouse full of sunken goods for sale. "
Experts believe that the departure of the host of this morning's column, one of Britain's most valuable stars, may have cost the company millions because the company invests heavily in products ranging from seating and candles to clothing and domestic clothing, and may be further delayed.
And that could mean the end of a long period of friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Taracap, for 10 years.
Willoughby founded the Truley company with Cape in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the Board in March.
And on vacation with the couple, Jones owns 40% of the shares of the TV company in Baldwin.
Willoughby will become M.S.'s brand ambassador and replace AnteMaplin as the host of the independent television station, "I am a celebrity."
A source near Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business business."
Hard talk, "and then we fall in love."
He's joking because he's making a comment that he thinks he's a "non-president" and that he's very active with the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and he's going to be criticized by the press.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump used it to simulate the news anchor.
"I didn't give up anything."
He pointed out that Kim Jong-un was interested in holding his second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June, and Trump praised it as a big step towards the denuclearization of Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations are at an impasse.
More than three months after Singapore's summit in June, the top Korean diplomat Lee Yong Ho said to the world's leaders on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would not accept any form of negotiation.
Instead, he pointed out that the United States was continuing to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his lecture.
"We did a good job on the Korean question," he said.
"We're going to war with Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
And we have a very good relationship. "
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong-un had yielded positive results - the rocket tests had been completed, the hostages had been released and the bodies of American soldiers sent back to the United States.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim Jong-un.
"It's too easy to be president, but it's not about 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, but about 200 people standing there."
Indonesia's seas and earthquakes destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, in the aftermath of the Loon Island earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of the island has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, and this is a prelude to international aid.
Ms. Sampen says, "Unfortunately, in a number of cases, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so there will be challenges."
Although the Save the Children is setting up a team to go to Palu, it's not sure if foreign workers will be able to work there.
According to Mr. Sotopo, a speaker for the National Disaster Agency, Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Pale to determine whether international agencies are allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given Indonesia's constant earthquake, the country's anger at nature is still inadequate.
Although a beach shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not common on other coasts.
Despite the fact that the alarm is in force, Palu obviously has no warning system, which could be one of the causes of the loss of life.
At the best, it's challenging to travel between many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters complicate logistics.
A medical ship to treat earthquake victims on Long Island is going to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Sacovedo has made the infrastructure that improves Indonesia's damage a central part of his campaign, investing a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the shortage of funds has been bothering Mr. Zoco's government, because he's about to be re-elected next year.
Mr. Zoco is still under pressure from the unbecoming sectarian tensions in Indonesia, and the majority of Muslim members have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced out of their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought with machetes, arrows and other rough weapons in the streets.
Look: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool evened the score in the competition with his opponent.
On Saturday, at the Stanford Bridge Park in London, Daniels Trech saved Liverpool's life at the British Super Bowl with one goal in the 89th minute.
Stuart got a pass from Sheldan Shachry at about 30 yards from the driveway gate, when his team fell down at 1 to 0.
He hits the ball on his left side and kicks it to a remote pillar.
When the ball goes to the upper right corner of the door, it's so high over the penalty zone.
The ball finally fell to the jumping capa Arisavaraga and fell to the net.
Stuart said to the Liverpool Football Club, "I'm just trying to get into a position, grab a ball, like Sark always kicks as far as I can, so I'm just trying to make time for myself."
"I saw Canter pass, I set the ball, not so much, I just shot. "
After getting a score in the 25th minute from the Belgian ball star, Eden Hazard, in the middle of the field, one-zero.
The blue front is reciting Pymat Okovačić in the course of the competition, then turns around near the center and enters half of Liverpool.
Kovačić made a quick concession in the middle of the field.
And then he shot into a beautiful straight pass, bringing Hazad into the restricted area.
Hazad went past the line of defense, left foot to the door, across the Arizona Baker in Liverpool, into the remote pillar.
Liverpool competed with Naples at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at St. Paul's in Italianapolis.
Thursday at 3 p.m., drivers meet Videoton in the European Union, in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian Ocean rose to 832.
On Sunday morning, Indonesia’s disaster facility said that the number of people killed by earthquakes and tsunamis had risen to 832.
The institutional speaker, Sutop Prvo Nugro, at a press conference, said that it was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and that the waves of the earthquake were up to 20 feet high.
There are more than 380,000 people in Palu, and there are fragments of collapsed buildings everywhere.
Police arrested a male, 32 years old, suspected of murdering a woman, leading to his death.
The police opened a murder investigation following the discovery of a female body in Birkenhead, Massachusetts, this morning.
This 44-year-old woman was found stabbed on Grayson Street, John Road, at 7:55 a.m., while a 32-year-old man was accused of murder.
Police have urged witnesses in the area to report.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagen, "the investigation is still in its early stages, but I hope all of it is that we can be contacted if we see or hear anything suspicious on Birkenhead John Street.
At the same time, I appeal to anyone, especially the taxi driver, to contact us if your car recorder has any low-level information, which may be useful for our investigation. '
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who found the body was from Birkenhead, and that the body was found to be an entry into a house.
This afternoon, the person who knew the woman arrived and asked her where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still going on, and the police say they've informed the victim's family this morning.
A taxi driver from the Grayson Building tried to return to his apartment but told the police not to enter or leave the building.
When he learned the circumstances of the case, he said he couldn't help it.
The building residents were told it would take a few hours before they could be allowed into the building.
A man heard from the police that the entire area was thought to be the scene of the crime.
A woman on the scene cried.
He kept repeating "worst."
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars are inside the perimeter, and another cop is outside.
The entire police force is inside the perimeter and is watching the apartment.
If anyone finds any information, contact DM@MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact the Crime Prevention Section at 0800,555,111, note 247 of 30 September.
The Kronwell statue of the council became the latest commemorative event in history.
The deportation is more symbolic for the Taliban who believe in the destruction of many British culture and religious art by their followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "smugly" and "intended to rewrite history."
According to John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Association, "the removal of the Oliver Cromwell statue outside the Westminster Palace as a goal is inevitable in today ' s discussion.
The sacred worship of the British civil war was neither a command nor a practice by Cromwell.
Or the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of what his great-grandfather Thomas did in the last century.
Sir William Hamor Sonikrovt's ambitious description of Cromwell confirms the view of the 19th century and is part of the history of characters that many consider to be worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith wired to Sunday: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, thought that Cromwell was the champion of the Council against external pressure, of course he was the monarchy. "
The subject of a complete and accurate representation remains a topic of discussion in history.
The 17th century conflict, of course, led to the development of our country after Day, and Cromwell was a representative of the other party to the conflict.
His achievements as the Protector of the Nation are also worthy of our celebration and remembrance. "
A Chinese farmer was bitten to death by a pig.
According to local media reports, a farmer in southwest China was bitten to death by a pig in the market.
According to the South China Morning Post, on Sunday, the man named "Yuan" was found dead in a severe arteries breakdown in the six-plate water market in Guizhou Province, where he was exposed to blood.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Sinning City, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to inject pigs from pig farms.
He was planning to go to the market with his cousin on Wednesday from the isolated province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found his body and found the door to the pighouse next door open.
According to him, there's blood in a giant male pig's mouth in a pig's den.
According to the report, the forensics confirmed that this 550-pound male pig had bitten the pig farmer.
"Youyang Evening News quotes the victim's cousin Wu, "my cousin's foot was bitten to the bone.
The surveillance footage shows Yuan went into the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed him.
He was found dead about an hour later.
The pig that bit the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the evening news that the pig had been locked up in case it attacked anyone else, while the police were gathering evidence.
Yuan's family and market manager are said to be claiming compensation for Yuan's death.
Even though few, pigs attacked humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to her husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer on the floor until the farmer's wife scared the pig.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba and a CBC news pig usually don't show offensive but blood smells like a fire line.
"They just want to play.
They're pigs, curious pigs... and they don't want to hurt people.
All you have to do is show them proper respect, "He said.
Stormy Rosa's wind has brought widespread storms to the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as she moves towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But next time Rosa will continue to bring heavy rains to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
As early as 5 a.m., Hurricane Rosa reached 85 miles an hour and was still the first-class hurricane, and on Sundays eastbound, 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure trough is forming over the Pacific Ocean and heading east in the direction of the western coast of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to Mexico's local area on Monday.
Next, the interaction between the heat of the water vapour and the near low cyclone will bring widespread and heavy rainfall to the southwest.
One to four inches of rainfall in a local area will cause flash floods, mudslides and landslides.
Hot water vapour will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in some parts of the region, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially Arizona, rainfall can reach 2-4 inches.
Because of the dispersed nature of the hot water, there is a high risk of explosive flooding in the face of conditions of deterioration.
The hot rain conditions strongly suggest that no risk of walking to the desert.
Heavy rains will turn the canyon into a floodbed, and thunderstorms will bring local wind and dust.
The low-pressure tanks that are about to land will bring heavy rainfall to the local parts of the Southern California coast.
Total rainfall may reach half an inch, leading to small mudslides and wet roads.
This rain will be the first rain in the rainy season.
A few sporadic hot rains are expected to arrive in Arizona on Sunday night and early on Monday morning, and the wider rains will be on Monday and Tuesday next week.
Heavy rains will cover sector 4 on Tuesdays and next Wednesdays.
In October, with the warming in the Arctic, there were some dramatic changes in temperature across the United States, but the hot zone remained relatively warm.
Sometimes it causes sudden changes in short-term temperatures.
One obvious example is that the Central American region experienced a very strong temperature differential on Sunday.
In Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, St. Louis and Moines, Iowa, the temperature difference is close to 20 degrees.
In the next few days, there will be a much wider summer sun.
It is expected that most parts of the Middle East of the United States will be warm in October, covering 80 percent of the south plains to the northeast.
New York's temperature can reach 80 degrees Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the United States will have temperatures above average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Canova's hearing.
More than 20 million people on six television channels watched Thursday's impeccable testimony by the Supreme Court nominee Bret Canova and the woman who accused him of sexual assault.
At the same time, political deadlock persisted, and the regular show was broadcast on TV on the last minute of Friday: a one-week investigation of the charge was ordered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flyck by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100% sure that Canova was in a high school line to touch her while drunk and try to take off her shirt.
Canova was in his passionate testimony that he was absolutely certain it never happened.
According to Nelson, there are more than 24 million people watching it.
The company's average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
This includes PBS, C-SAPN and Fox Business's failure to immediately calculate the data.
It's usually Nelson who's hard to figure out the people he sees in his office.
In one way or another, the size of this crowd may be similar to that of the football season or Oscar's audience.
Nelson said that 5.6 million viewers at the hearing throughout the day saw the discussion director of Fox News News, who strongly supported Canova's identification.
ABC received second place for 3.26 million viewers.
Nelson says the CBS is 3.1 million, the NBC is 2.94 million, the MSNBC is 2.89 million, the CNN is 2.52 million.
The audience is still very interested after the hearing.
Frank was at the centre of the Friday drama.
Following a statement from the office of the Republicans of Windhoek that he would vote in favour of Cavanaugh, the protesters shouted at him on Friday morning when he was being haird by CNN and CBS cameras when he tried to take the elevator to the judicial board hearing.
CNN broadcast him standing up for a few minutes because he was accused of being depressed.
"I'm standing in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he'll tell the whole nation the truth?
He was told, "You have power but many women don't."
Frick says his office has issued a statement that he will speak more at the committee hearing before the elevator doors close.
After a few hours of live television and radio broadcasts, the JJC voted to bring Cavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
But Frank said that he did it only to understand that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominees next week, and that the few Democrats had been urging it.
Blake and his friend, Senator Chris Cowens, convinced him.
After talking to Cooney and a few senators, Frick made a decision.
Frank had a choice, because it's obvious that without an investigation, the Republicans would not vote for Cavanaugh.
President Trump has granted permission to the FBI to investigate the charge against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of the "politics" of the British retreat from Europe.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused her plan to leave the European Union of "politics" that undermined the future national interests of the United Kingdom.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived in Birmingham, England, on September 29th, 2018 for the Conservative Party conference.
In an interview with her in another newspaper headline, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Cheksdeno project, saying that the British and the European Union should ask each other to collect tax revenues "is totally ridiculous."

"That's what you've been worried about." Wade said.
Volcanic ash in Mexico City
The ash from the Bobocattel volcano has reached the southern community of Mexico's capital.
Saturday's National Disaster Control Center warns Mexicans to stay away from the crater, which has recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center is monitoring a number of rumblings and tremors.
Images from social media show a thin layer of ash covering windshields in Mexico City, including Xochimico.
Since the September 2017 earthquake in central Mexico, the geophysicalists have noticed an increase in activity in this volcano, 45 miles southeast of the capital (72 km).
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
On the eve of Independence Day, the police clashed with Catalan separatist forces.
Saturday, thousands of people from Barcelona took part in a demonstration against the first anniversary of the independence of Catalonia, and six pro-independence demonstrators were arrested in clashes with riot police.
A group of masked separatists were stopped by the riot police, who threw eggs and powder paint at the riot police, and the streets filled with tourists rose to smoke.
There was a clash that night when the police used the baton to control it.
The pro-independence groups chanted slogans "Don't forget, don't forgive" for hours, and they shouted "Heil Spain" to the union protesters.
According to the local media, 14 people were in need of medical treatment for minor injuries during demonstrations.
One year after the October 1 referendum celebrated by the Catalan separatists was recognized by Madrid as illegal, the situation in the region, which was dominated by the idea of independence, remains tense.
The voters chose independence by the number of negative votes, but the low turnout and the majority of the voters against the referendum boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, in the past, the police tried to stop violent clashes at polling stations in the region, injuring about 1,000 people.
Support for independent groups camped all night Friday night to stop demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but was forced to follow other routes.
A 68-year-old electrician, Nassemmer, joined his wife in a separatist demonstration and said he no longer had any hope of independence in Catalonia.
"We had the best time in the past.
I saw my parents crying because they could vote, but we were trapped, "He said.
Despite the crucial victory achieved in December in the local elections, the Catalan pro-independence parties are today trying to maintain this trend, although many of the well-known leaders are either exiled or awaiting trial for organizing a referendum and proclaiming independence.
Joan, a 42-year-old electrician, used his cell phone to document demonstrations in support of the police and to claim that the conflict was caused by two politicians.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Olyjan Kras, one of the nine leaders of the pre-trial prison in Catalonia since the end of last year, announced that he would be participating in next year's elections to the European Parliament.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn democratic values and the Spanish government we've seen," he said.
A man was arrested after a car hit his house.
Three men aged 33,34,39 were arrested after a number of car crashes in Delhi, London.
The incident took place on Thursday at 19:30 in the new month of Barinagard.
Detective Bob Blooming's story caused damage to the doors and the main body.
There's also a burning arrow in the car.
Munga's goal has allowed Livingstone to win the Vagrants at 1-0.
Dory Munga's first goal is to ensure that Livingstone wins.
This is Steven Gerard's second defeat in the 18th game.
Dory Munga's goal proves this difference. Gary Holt's team moves to the second place in the Hebrew border.
Gerard's team has still not won the tournament in the season, and next Sunday they'll face their eight-point leader, the Bullseyes.
Before that, the Travellers will be fighting against the Vienna Express on Thursday at the main European Union tournament.
At the same time, Livingston expanded his non-defeating record to six, and since last month's replacement for Kenny Miller, Bishop John Holt is still trying to win.
Livingston missed a chance to deal with an unattended guest.
Holt's direct attack created all sorts of trouble for the homeless, and they should have taken a lot of lead before the goal.
Scott Robinson was trying to get the ball out of the way, but then Alan Riggs had to push backwards, and Craig Halkert got behind the ball and went past the door.
The main team knew they could make trouble for the guest team on the locator ball and let the vagrants attack in front of them.
That's the key to the goal.
The Vagrants gave Livingston a random ball, Livingston made an empty file, Declan Garah and Robinson worked together to pass the ball to Monga, and then scored right in the restricted area.
During that time, the Travellers took control of the game, but found that the main team was inconspicuous, and that the door was almost undisturbed by Liam Cory.
Although Alfredo Morelos forced Corey to rescue, this pattern continued in the second half.
The Travellers' door stopped Alan MacGregor from using his foot against Scott Pittman, and Risco hit another locator ball in Livingston.
Livingston's restricted area continues to enter and unwind, and the two dots — Halcett's offensive replacements, Gertrude Middleton and handball — are found to be ineffective.
"Amazing" Livingston -- analysis.
Alsdale Lamont of the British Broadcasting Corporation, Scotland, is at Tony Macaloni Stadium.
Livingstone won with remarkable performance.
For one person, they're excellent, and they're continuing on this upward trajectory with an unexpected performance.
They've hardly changed their game style and people since they got back to the top, but it's all thanks to Holt, who inspired the team since he got here.
He's got a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkert's super-capable, organized a structured line of defense, and Monga took Conner Goldson and Joe Wallal to watch him for the rest of his life.
However, the Travellers lack incentives.
Under Gerard's leadership, they do well sometimes, but they're far from the standards.
They're missing the door -- they've only torn the main gate once -- and it's kind of like a alarm clock for the middle-water vagrants.
Erdoğan's resonance in Cologne is mixed.
Saturday, the weather was clear, the Turkish and German leaders were smiling and having breakfast in Berlin.
This is President Erdoğan’s last day of his visit to Germany — a controversial visit aimed at restoring relations between the NATO allies.
Their arguments include human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdoğan then went to Cologne to unveil a new, giant mosque.
This city is the largest Turkish concentration outside Turkey.
The police, for security reasons, prevented 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but as a result, many supporters saw their president nearby.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdoğan — many of them Kurds — have also expressed their feelings by condemning Erdoğan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him.
The protests on both sides reflected their disagreement with the visitors, with some German Turks commending him as a hero and others denouncing him as an dictator.
A car accident in the city of Dettford: a car crash, a bike rider's dead.
A bike crash and a car crash in London killed a bike rider.
At about 10:15 a.m. on the summer hour in England, the accident occurred in the southwest of the city of Dettford, near the corner of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, a busy part of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died instantly.
Another biker died a few months ago in a hit-and-run on Childs Street, about a mile away on Saturday.
According to the London Police Department, the police are in the process of identifying this man and notifying his next of kin.
The road was closed, the bus was rerouted and the driver was advised to avoid the area.
Six officers were injured in a riot.
Prison officers said six prison officers were injured in a riot in a heavily guarded men's prison.
On Sunday, at 9.30 p.m., there was a riot at HMP Luddy Prison in Uster County, and it's still going on.
The tornado expert was involved in the riot and eight inmates were held in the side hall.
The police officers who suffered minor facial injuries were treated on the spot.
The representative of the prison service said, "The trained prison staff have been trained to deal with the ongoing HMP Director Latti prison incident.
Six injured workers have been treated.
We do not tolerate prison violence, and we all know that those responsible for it will be handed over to the police, who may spend more time in prison ... "
HMP has more than 500 prisoners in Latif Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in this country.
According to reports, the director of the prison was treated in a hospital after an attack by a prisoner in June.
Last October, the bomb squad was placed in prison to deal with this serious riot, in which people were attacked by pool.
Hurricane Rosa caused flash floods, threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. Dry drylands may benefit.
Although it is rare to hit Arizona with hot low air pressure, it could happen early next week, as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, bringing the risk of flash floods.
The National Meteorological Agency has issued weather alerts for Mondays and Tuesdays, from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstick, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
It's expected that Hurricane Rosa will go straight through Phoenix on Tuesdays and there'll be rain some nights a week.
On Twitter, the National Meteorological Office in Phoenix said, "In 1950, within 200 miles of the city, only 10 hot-band tornadoes remained in hot-band storms or low-air pressure!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) is within 40 miles of the AZ border ... "
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts a 2-4 inch rainfall, but the Mogolon region in Arizona will reach 6 inches.
Other parts of the southwest desert, including the central L.A. mountains and large basins, may have between one and two inches of rainfall, and the total rainfall in different regions may reach four inches.
For areas beyond the risk of flash floods, the rain of Hurricane Rosa may be a good thing because these areas are suffering from drought.
Although the floods are a serious problem, some rainfall may benefit the southwest, which is currently experiencing a dry environment.
According to the Dry Drought Monitoring Center in the United States, more than 40% of Arizona is in extreme drought, which is the second-highest level, "weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path passes through the Mexican peninsula, landing in Lower California.
Hurricane Rosa is still in a storm on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punyugnia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm hits the colder seawater in the Pacific Ocean, and it weakens.
So it's expected to land in Mexico on Monday afternoon or at night with the intensity of the hot storm.
In parts of Mexico, rainfall can be very high, causing severe flood hazards.
"The projected total rainfall from California to the north-west of Sonora is expected to reach 3-6 inches, with a maximum probability of 10 inches,"weather.com reports.
Hurricane Rosa will travel north of Mexico in the form of a hot storm, then arrives on the Arizona border in the morning of Tuesday in the form of a hot low air pressure, then up through Arizona and into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main hazard of forecasting a hurricane, Rosa or a residual storm is the heavy rains in the north-west of Lower California, Sonora and the south-west desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center says.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods, desert mudslides and landslides.
Midsumer Norton attack: arrest of four attempted murderers.
After a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
On Saturday, at about 4:00 a.m. at summertime in England, a wounded teenager was found in the Ekselceiatles area of Midsumernoton.
He's being taken to the hospital, and the situation is stable.
Evan and Samuelsett said they arrested a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man overnight in the Evanmouth area.
The police are calling for anyone who might have filmed the incident on their cell phones to come forward.
Trump says that Cavanaugh is "deprived" and "anger" by the Democrats.
Trump said at a rally in Welling City, West Virginia, that "voting to Judge Cavanaugh is a strategy to reject the indifference and arrogance of the Democratic Party."
Trump says that Cavanaugh was "smugly" and "anger" of the Democrats in the nomination process.
Cavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Tuesday, strongly and vehemently denying that Christine Bryce Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers more than a decade ago.
Ford is testifying against her at the hearing.
Saturday, the President said, "The American people saw Cavanaugh's talent, integrity and courage that day."
He said to a group of supporters in West Virginia, "The vote for Judge Cavanaugh is proof that he is one of the most successful legal figures of our time, a judge with a record of high public service."
When the President spoke about the importance of Republican voters in the mid-term elections, he referred to Cavanaugh's nomination in a crutch.
"Five weeks from the important election of our lives.
I wasn't running, but I was running, and he said,
"That's why I fought everywhere for the great candidate."
Trump thinks the party's mission is "resistance and obstruction".
A high-ranking assistant Republican leader told CNN that the Senate would vote on the first key protocol of the Cavanaugh nomination no later than Friday.
The Indonesian earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds of people, and the number of deaths is rising.
On Saturday, according to official sources, there was a massive earthquake and a tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesia, which hit the beach with waves and left at least 384 people dead.
On Friday evening, hundreds of people gathered to celebrate on the beach in Palu City, where a huge wave of 6 metres (18 feet) stormed the shore, swept many people to death and destroyed everything they had been.
After the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, many people were on the beach, not running away immediately and becoming victims, and the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency BNPB's spokesperson, Sutopol Puvo Nugroho, said in the Yagada briefing.
Nugroho said, "It's not the only thing that comes, it drags cars, timber, houses, everything on the ground, and, before it hits the coast, it crosses the open sea at 800 km per hour (497 miles per hour).
He said that some people had survived the tree to escape the beach.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pale.
The aerial photographs released by the Disaster Reduction Agency showed that many buildings and shops had been destroyed, bridges had collapsed and a mosque had been surrounded by water.
The aftershock continues to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The area where 2.4 million people live feels the series of earthquakes.
In a statement by the Indonesian Institute of Evaluation and Technology Applications (BPPT), the energy released by the Friday earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bombs that were dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
It says that this city is at the end of a narrow, long bay, and that this geographical location could widen the size of the ocean.
Nugroho used the word "substantial" to say that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that under the rubble of the collapsed building, the bodies of some trapped victims were found, 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and damage could be greater in the coastal area of the north coast of Palu, 300 km (190 miles), closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Nugroho says that the communication in Tangara is completely disabled, with no information.
More than 300,000 people lived there, and the Red Cross said in their statement that their employees and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
It says, "It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not informing the beach about the attack on Pale, despite the official's statement that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In a video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of the building shouted madly at the people down the street, warning everyone that the sea was coming.
The wall's water hits the shore in a few minutes and takes the building and the car.
Reuters can't immediately confirm the true nature of the film.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused power outages around Palu, and communications were cut off, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate search and rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military began sending cargo planes to transport aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees were still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for disaster relief only and will be closed until October.
President Zoko Victor arranged a Sunday visit to the Palou shelter.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian Ocean rises to over 800.
It's very bad.
Dozeba said that the staff of the World Vision Gala had arrived safely in the city of Palu, sheltering the tarpaulins built in the office yard, and they passed through the disaster zone.
He said, "They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed."
It's very bad.
As relief organizations began their rescue efforts, some complained that highly qualified foreign aid workers had been prevented from going to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, overseas funds, assets and personnel can only be opened when disaster sites are declared a national disaster area.
It's not announced yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level." The Indonesian Red Cross speaker, Olya Aryani, said.
"As soon as the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we open the door to international aid, but it's not yet in this state."
After Friday's earthquake and tsunami, Palu came on the second night and the families and friends of the missing supported changing the depressing storyline of the natural disaster, hoping that miracles would happen to the people they loved.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue crew rescued a woman who had been crushed for two days with her mother's body.
Two of the glider activists trained by the Indonesian National High-Air Drilling Team, Genton Subandono, have disappeared and completed their Asian Games training in Indonesia early in the month.
Including Mr. Mandage, the rest of the students who were trapped at the Hotel Rialoa.
"As a deep sportsman in the field of high-altitude parachute, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Ghenton recounts that high-altitude glitters spread the news of the fall of the Hotel of Roa Roa, and that in the next few hours he tried to send WhatsApp information to the contestants who were participating in a beach event in Palu.
However, his information was marked with only a grey hook, not a pair of blue hooks.
"I don't think that's a successful message," he said.
At the Newport Fashion Center, the thief took an extra $26,750 from the ATM.
According to news from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, at the Newport Fashion Center, Brink's employees stole $26,750 from a thief while adding money to an auto ark.
The driver of that car keeps collecting money from the buffet at the entertainment center, and he's getting ready to deliver more money, D. Dennis McCarthy wrote in his release.
He's busy, and another man, running behind Brink's staff, stole a big bag of money he was supposed to deliver.
According to the information released, several suspects were found to have fled the scene, but the police did not know the number of people involved.
If you have any information about their identity, please call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The singer changed his name.
The singer Kanye West changed his name -- yeah.
On Sunday, he announced a change of name on Twitter, saying: "The official name is Kanye West. "
Forty-one-year-old West has been using his nickname as the eighth album in June.
This change occurred before it appeared on Saturday night, and it is expected to launch its new album, "Yandhi."
The founder of the show said that he had replaced the singer Eleanor Grande, who had canceled the show for "emotional reasons".
With the exception of the initials of his current career name, West used to say that word religiously.
I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means 'you' in the Bible,' and West spoke to the big boy on the radio in the first half of this year when he talked about his album name.
"So I'm you, I'm us, we're...
He's become clean from the only Kanye, but we're good, we're bad, we're confused, we're all reflective.
This album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's one of many renamed famous rappers.
Sean Kums is called "Puppet Daddy", "P. Didy" or "Dedy," but this year he announces the names "love" and "brotherly love".
West's former collaborators, Jay-Z, also use or do not use hyphenation and capital letters.
Mexican president AMLo vowed not to use the army against the civilian population.
Mexican President André Manuel López Obrado vowed not to use military force against civilians on the 50th anniversary of his country’s bloody revenge on students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tratloco Square on Saturday that "no force will ever be used against the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire on peaceful demonstrations in the square, killing over 300 people, while the left-wing student movement was taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly supplements to learners and by opening more free public universities.
He said that joblessness and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the amount of AI.
The investors and artificial intelligence entrepreneurs who used to work in cereal songs, microsoft and apples, Lee Clement, said that the US should double its research spending in China as it became more active in the field of artificial intelligence.
These comments were made after the announcement of artificial intelligence by various departments of the United States, despite the lack of a formal strategy of artificial intelligence in the United States.
At the same time, China launched its project last year: its goal is to become the first place for artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
Lee said, "Since all the other countries have fallen far behind the United States, doubling the budget for AI research will be a good start, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI."
In an interview with the CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the amount of money would double the next major artificial intelligence achievement in the United States.
Lee, his book, "Amnipotent Wisdom Superland: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", was published this month by Horton Mifflin Harcourt, Chief Executive Officer of China's Creative Investment Corporation, which invested in Face++, one of China's most famous artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie Melon, developing a single-man intelligence system, defeating the highest-ranking American Othello chess player, and then acting as a top executive at the Microsoft Institute, and as CEO of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee could use the technical competition of the former U.S. government, such as the Mob Challenge of the Department of Defense ' s Advanced Research and Planning Bureau, and ask when the next competition will take place to help identify the next person with a vision.
Lee said that researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get government funding.
Lee said, "It's not China, it's business, it's China."
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently hired talented people from universities to work in artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its artificial intelligence work.
He said, "I think Dr. A.I. should get green cards all the time."
In July 2017, the Chinese State Department launched the Next Generation Artificial Wisdom Development Project.
Lee said that the National Science Fund of China would provide funding to academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, to American researchers, but that the quality of Chinese research work was low.
This year, the United States Department of Defense established a United Artificial Wisdom Center to attract industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Commission on Artificial Wisdom.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, U.S. legislation has attempted to establish a working wisdom NSSC, but it has not been acted upon for months.
The Macedonians will vote on whether to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia held a referendum to decide whether to change their country's name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", which would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which had prevented it from joining the European Union and the North Treaty.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, which insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents an opinion of its territory and refuses to join NATO and the European Union.
In June, the two Governments reached an agreement based on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents believe that the change would destroy the ethnic identity of the majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Georgi Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and that the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the minimum voting rate would reach 50% of the minimum required for the referendum to be effective.
The question of the referendum was: " Are you in favour of joining NATO and the European Union and accepting the agreement with Greece... "
Among them are the renaming supporters of Prime Minister Zoran Zayev who believe that Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged after the dissolution of Yugoslavia and is worth the price of joining institutions such as the European Union and the North Treaty Organization.
In Skopje, 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska said, "I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for young people in Macedonia, and for them to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means that all of us will be safer."
Although not legally bound, there are enough council members who have indicated that they will abide by the results of the vote and make it decisive.
The change of name will require more than two thirds of the Congress.
According to the National Electoral Commission, there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
Sixty-two-year-old Gjos Tanevsky, a candidate from Skopje, said, "I voted for my little friend, Europe is our place."
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife, Zorika, and his son, Duško, voted in Macedonia on September 30, 2018 to change the name of the country, which will open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the conference building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vlakimir Kavaldakov is preparing a pavilion and is setting up a bench in front of a tent built by those who boycotted the referendum.
Kavadakov said, "We support NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with a sober mind, not through the service door."
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to be Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia to become part of Europe's individualization.
According to Prime Minister Zayev, joining NATO will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I'm sure most people will agree, because more than 80% of our citizens support the European Union and the North Treaty."
He said, "Approved" would lead to "a confirmation of our future."
A poll released by the Macedonia Institute of Policy Research last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would vote -- a lower than required turnout.
Another poll conducted by MacedoniaTelma shows that 57% of the respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they'd vote for it.
If the referendum is to succeed, it must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first severe blow ever to the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
Look: Sergio Argüello of the Man City team crossed the entire Brighton defense line to score the goal.
On Saturday, at the English Manchust Ittihad field, in Man City 2-0, the Big Brayton game, Sergio Argüello and Rahim Sterling broke through Brighton's line.
It's hard to believe that Argüello's goal at the 65th minute of entry.
The Argentine front caught a pass in the middle of the game.
He ran between the three Brighton guards and headed for the void.
Aguiro found himself surrounded by four green shirt players.
He went around a guard and crossed the borders of Brighton.
Then he passes the ball to the left and finds Sterling.
The British front was using his first touch ball in the restricted area to return the ball to Argüello, where Argüello shot the ball to the right side of the door and defeated Matthew Ryan at the Brighton Gate.
Man City manager Guardiola said to the reporter, "Aguiro struggles for his feet."
"We talked about him kicking 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're so lucky she made a goal at the moment. "
But it was Sterling who made the Sky Blueball team win the original advantage in the British Super Bowl.
The goal was in the 29th minute.
Argüello got the ball deep in Brighton's defense area.
He sent a beautiful direct transmission to Balroy Sanay on the left.
Sana's made touchballs several times before drawing Sterling's shot at the pillar.
The sky blueball team's front line is prowling the ball into the net before it slips out of the world.
On Tuesday, at 12.55 p.m., the Man City team at the Rhineneka Stadium in Simsem, Germany, competed with the Hovenheim team.
Shelzer wants to play the saboteurs in the battle.
There's no reason to force the team to start again.
But shelzer, who has always won, wants to be on Sunday's competition for the Colorado Rocky team, but only if the Rocky team still has the effect of the end of the season, and they lead one of the Birochs in the West of Carolina.
The Lokis won the Nationals by 5-2 on Friday night, locking up at least one card, but they still look forward to locking down the first district champion.
"Although we did it for nothing, at least we can hold the pitchboard and know that Denver's audience and rivals may be the highest playing climate of any of the points I've ever faced this year.
"Why don't I want to be in this race?"
The National Guard didn't announce Sunday's first pitcher, but it's said they're inclined to pitch in the circumstances.
The 34th launch will be hosted by Sherser, who trained in the cow shed on Thursdays and will pitch on Sundays during normal break hours.
The Washington right pitcher casts a 2.53-point mark of 18-7 in the 220-2/3 season with 300 strike-outs.
Trump's having a rally in West Virginia.
Speaking of the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term elections, the President referred to the situation of Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh.
"All we do will be threatened in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This time it's very, very important -- I'm not running, but I'm running, so I'm fighting for good candidates everywhere, he says.
Trump goes on to say, "You see this very, terrible democracy group, you see it happening.
They're determined to take back power by whatever means necessary, and you see the mean, the nasty behavior.
They don't care if they hurt the side, if they have to run over the side to gain power and control, they want power and control, and we don't give it to them. "
He said that the Democrat's mission was "resistance and obstruction".
He said, "In the last four days, you can see that," and called it "Democrats," angry, mean, dirty, hypocritical."
He mentioned the first member of the Senate ' s Judicial Committee, Diana Einstein, as the first member of the Democratic Council, which caused the crowd to brag.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Are you leaking the file?
Well, well, well.
No, no, no. I'm waiting for a really closed body language. It's the most closed language I've ever seen. "
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
He can't stand people who say what they think.
It's not surprising when my party's Momentum radicals voted against me.
After all, I'm the latest in a group of workers who have been told that they're not welcome because we're talking about our ideas.
My co-worker, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because he was determined to stand up against anti-Jewish.
As far as I'm concerned, I condemn the criticism that I don't agree with Jeremy Colbin's point of view.
In terms of the importance of responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, in Europe, the irony is that Jeremy doesn't agree with previous leaders on similar issues.
The announcement of the Notting Han East Labour Party meeting on Friday says, "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
In the eight years I've been a member of the local Labour Party, this is the case with the GC meeting on Friday night.
Sadly, today, it's not the tone of many meetings, and the political promise of "more friendly, more gentle" has long been forgotten, if it's really the beginning.
It's becoming clear that the opposite is not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is judged on whether or not it is accepted by the party's leadership.
This happened after Jeremy became leader, because I thought my colleagues with similar political perspectives had started to expect me to make a 180-degree shift to take a position that I would not have agreed to -- either in terms of national security being a single European Union market.
Every time I make a public statement -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- there's a lot of talk in the social media calling for the cancellation of the election and the condemnation of middle-class politics, so I shouldn't join the Labour Party.
And this isn't just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because it's always political to comment on me.
I fear the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face sexual discrimination or racist insults every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that the level of damage has been normalized.
Jeremy Colbin said last week that the Labour Party should develop a tolerant culture.
The reality is, we're not going to be a broad church, and as every "no trust" move or rule changes, the party gets narrower.
In the last two years, I've had a lot of advice urging me to keep my head down, not so loud, and then I'm gonna be fine.
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Thirty-two years ago, I was a junior student, and as a result of the neglect of the Chaicher government, my class at the joint school really collapsed. Ever since I joined the Labour Party, I've been trying to get better public services for those most in need - either as local councilors or as government ministers.
I would never hide my political position, including in the last election.
In the Nottingham East, no one has any doubts about my policy position and the differences with the current leadership.
For those who moved the motion on Friday, all I wanted to say was that when the country was trying to get out of business, it would cost families, businesses and public services, I couldn't understand how to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leaders of the Workers' Party.
But in fact, one of the information I'm going to send is not about Pinodin Han, but about my people, whether they're members of the labour party or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that whatever the threat of withdrawal or political expediency, will not prevent me from acting in the best interests of all of us.
Chris Leslie is a senator at the Nottingham East.
Al-Air 38-17 Melrose: The undefeated Alden Top
Two attempts later may have led to a deviation in the final outcome, but there's no doubt that Al is worthy of victory in this wonderful Tanant Super Bowl.
They're at the top of the list, the only undefeated team in the 10 teams.
At the end of the day, they're good defenses, and they're better at taking the opportunity to win the team, and Coach Peter Muche has the right to be happy.
"So far, we've been tested in the game, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he says.
Robin Christy of Melrose says, "Well, it's Al's fault, and they're better at taking chances than we are."
Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, with Fraser Cremo taking the lead, but Scotland's leader, Rowley Hughes, who ate a yellow card, was released by the Braves, and the Melrose team took the upper hand in the human count, and Jason Baggart took one of the missed scores.
Cremo expanded Al's lead with a point ball, then, at the end of half the game, he gave Al a single try to score, and changed the score to 17-5 for the middle break.
But Melrose started in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's try was to score with Baggett, reducing the gap to five.
Subsequently, Ruharid Notte was taken away by the stretcher for a long time because of his serious injuries, and when he recommenced, Al took a further lead through the Tafod McDougall's attempt, with Krismo scores.
Acting Commander Blair McPherson was subsequently fined by the yellow card, and Melrose paid the replacement again, and after the intense pressure ended, Bruce Corwin won't score.
The main team came back, but when stran Hackinson was fined with no balls to hit Clemore outside the penalty line, McFlesson hit the ground behind Al's advance.
When Kyle Rowe caught up to David Armstrong's pitch, and his wingman Greg Henry was brought down, and after the fifth attempt, Clemo almost scored again from the start of the game.
The star of the movie "Still Game" seems to be starting a new career in the catering industry.
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seemed ready to enter the military hotel business and had been appointed director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which was written by him and co-directed by his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemhill.
The ninth season to announce to our partner will be the last season of the show, and Kirnan will be looking at his life after the Cregland project.
According to the official list, he's a board member of Alif Moon Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but the Scottish Sun News sources suggested that Kilnan wanted to be part of Glasgow's booming restaurant.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the Tribunal will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean.
The sailor patrol is in La Paz, the naval command that covers the cable.
A flag of sea and blue is high above a public building.
The naval base from Lake Kaka to the Amazon has the slogan: "The sea is ours by law.
Recovery is the responsibility. "
Bolivia's desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean, surrounded by land, is as clear as Chile's memory when the coast was lost in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in the last few decades, because Bolivia is waiting five years for an international tribunal to decide on October 1.
Robert Calsadi, a Bolivian diplomat, said, "It's a strong, united spirit, of course, to look forward to the outcome. "
There will be many Bolivians across the country who will view the decisions of the International Court of Justice through big screens, hoping that the Hague Court of International Arbitration will support Bolivia's claim — after decades of interrupted meetings — that Chile will have the duty to negotiate the approval of a maritime exit point for Bolivia with jurisdiction.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native President of Bolivia, faced with a controversial election war in the year ahead, and also relied on Monday's verdict.
At the end of August, he vowed: "We can return to the Pacific."
Some analysts, however, believe that the court will not make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and that it will not change anything.
The United Nations agency in the Netherlands does not have the power to determine Chile's territory, and they all stipulate that it will not influence the outcome of a possible conversation.
In the words of a Chilean international law expert, Paz Zarate, six months after hearing the final arguments, the international court ruled that the situation was "not complicated".
And not only did the last four years not push into Bolivia's national plan, but it could have blocked the plan.
Zárate says, "The problem with the sea is that the current Bolivian government has kidnapped. "
He believes that Morales' provocative rhetoric has gradually wiped out all of the low-willed Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain discussion after that.
Since 1962, neither country has sent diplomats to each other.
The representative of Bolivia at the Hague Tribunal, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Belza, did not appreciate the fact that the Tribunal was making decisions at an extraordinary speed.
On Monday, he said, "It's a very rare opportunity for Bolivia to open up a new era of relations with Chile and to bury a dispute that lasts 139 years with the common good."
And yet, the most popular president in Latin America, Qalzadira, denies that Morales is politically dependent on maritime issues.
And he said, "Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific."
"This decision gives us a chance to understand that we need to get out of the past."
The DPRK claims that nuclear weapons will not be realized unless the US can gain their trust.
The Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lee Yong Ho, said that if his country did not trust Washington, it would not be possible to eliminate nuclear weapons first.
Li spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to take follow-up action on the promises made by both leaders at the Singapore summit.
He said that because US Secretary of State Pompeyo seemed to be restarting the nuclear diplomacy that was in a state of deadlock three months after his meeting with Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
Lee said he thought that continuing sanctions and the United States' refusal to declare that the end of the Korean war could lead to the surrender of the DPRK would be a delusion.
The United States is cautious about agreeing to a declaration when Pyongyang has not made a remarkable disarmament operation.
Kim and US President Donald Trump both wanted a second summit.
But the Korean nation seems to regard nuclear weapons as the only way to guarantee its safety, and there is widespread suspicion that it will take them seriously.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Golden Peak.
Paris fashion shows the latest tide of giant hats, which will be marketed to the mall next to you.
If you want to expand your cover, or cover the sun completely, then don't look so much.
Designer Valentino and Tom Brown put on their SS19 series on stage T a lot of fancy super-sized caps that made the fashion scenes of the Paris Fashion Week look great.
This summer's really unreal hat sweeps Ins, and the designer sends their drawings to stage T.
Valentino's outstanding work is an exaggeration of light yellow hats, like feathers on the top of a model.
Other supersizes include watermelon with jewelry, a sorcerer hat and even a pineapple -- but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also shows a series of weird masks -- so we're in a hurry to cut Halloween.
These six-coloured masks have a lot of lips sewn, like Hannibal Lecter's more fashionable.
One of the works looks like a pulmonary kit with a diving tube and a diving glasses, and one of the work looks like a melted ice cream.
And if you keep looking at this huge fashion report -- you're lucky.
The tide observers predict that the big caps are trying to get close to the malls around you.
This super-size cap heat is a two-foot-wide straw hat from Rehana to Emily Latakovsky.
The superstitious fashion labels on the social media screen, representing the tidal caps, sent another big piece to stage T -- a model that was almost big enough to hold up a bathing suit to make sandbags.
The most prominent piece in the series La RivieraSS19 of the Paris Fashion Week was an orange brown leaf wiring bag with a palm leaf on the side of the solute, with a white leather hand on the top.
"I look forward to seeing big hats and sandbags on the streets in the summer of next year -- because the designers make a huge impact, it's hard to ignore the demand for super-sized ornaments."
John Edwards: The language skills that matter to the citizens of the world
An independent school in Scotland maintains a track record of academic excellence, and this record continues in 2018 with another excellent test, which is based only on individual co-group efforts in sports, art, music, and other groups.
These schools have 30,000 students in Scotland, represented by the Scottish Independent School Board (SCIS), and are dedicated to providing their parents and students with the best possible services.
The goal of independent schools is to help students adapt to a much longer and higher level of education, their chosen careers and their location as citizens of the world.
As a ministry of education that can design and customize school curricula, we believe that modern language is still a popular and demand-driven choice of course in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to him in a language that's clear to the other, it'll make an impression in his head.
If you talk to him in his language, the content of that conversation will touch his heart. "
This is a powerful reminder that when we want to build relationships and trust with people in other countries, we can't rely exclusively on English.
According to the results of this year ' s most recent test, language in independent schools is ranked at the top of the list.
Sixty-eight percent of students studying foreign languages have a higher A.
According to data collected from 74 SSIS member schools, 72 per cent of students have attained a higher A level in Chinese, while 72 per cent of students studying German, 69 per cent of students studying French and 63 per cent of students studying Spanish have the same A grade.
This shows that an independent school in Scotland supports foreign languages as an important skill that children and adolescents will need in the future.
Language as a subject of study, the curriculum of an independent school is given the same weight as that of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) in other ways.
A survey conducted by the British Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 per cent of the difficulties encountered by employers in filling vacant posts were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more promising work opportunities, many languages are needed, and skills are very important in a globalized world.
Whatever a man chooses, if he learns a second language, he will benefit from having the skills to accompany him throughout his life.
You can communicate directly with foreigners, which automatically leads the competition with multilinguals.
According to a 2013 survey of more than 4,000 adults in England, 75 per cent of the population has not been able to speak freely in foreign languages, and French is the only language that uses more than two digits, reaching 15 per cent.
That's why, for today's children, it's very important to invest in language teaching.
Especially in the developing economy, mastering a variety of languages makes it possible for children to have a better chance of having more valuable jobs.
In Scotland, there are different languages taught in every school.
Some schools focus on more traditional and modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your children's interests are, there are many languages available in independent schools, and experts with fields of competence work as teaching staff.
An independent school in Scotland is dedicated to providing children with a learning environment that adapts them to the skills they need to succeed, regardless of the future.
There is no denying that in this era, in a globalized business environment, language is still important for the future of a country, so it has to be reflected in education.
It's true that modern language is understood as "international communication skills".
The independent school will continue to offer the choice of diversity and achievement for the young generation of Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward's chairman of the Scottish Independent School Board.
LeBron started his first race in the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
LeBron's fan of the first L.A. Lakers is finally here.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announces that James will be at the pre-season opening of the San Diego Sunday pre-season competition, which will be fought by the Denver Golddiggers.
But it hasn't been decided that he'll be here for more than a few minutes.
Walton said on the Lakers' network: "There's gonna be more than one minute left, less than 48 minutes."
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweets that James may be present in a limited number of minutes.
In his training earlier this week, James asked about his plans for the first six seasons of the Lakers.
He said, "I don't need a pre-season to prepare for my career."
Trump at the Western Virginia campaign, YouTube.
President Donald Trump started a regular campaign tonight in Welling, West Virginia.
Trump plans to hold five contests next week. This is the first of five, including staying in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, selected by Trump, has been given a guaranteed number of votes, and his next goal is to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republicans may lose control of the National Assembly in November.
What time is Trump's campaign in West Virginia tonight? What do you view online?
Trump's campaign in Welling City, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the east of the United States on September 29th, 2018.
You can view Trump's campaign in West Virginia online via YouTube.
Trump may have spoken for the Supreme Court Justice's nominee, Brett Cavanaugh, at that hearing this week, because the Senate confirmed that the vote had been accused of sexual misconduct for a week, and the FBI was involved in the investigation, which became nervous.
But the primary objective of this frequent campaign is to help the Republicans to make the elections in November.
According to Reuters, as a result, President Trump's campaign team called the five contests next week "to inspire the morale of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans try to keep and increase the majority of seats in the Senate and the House of Assembly."
One unnamed speaker in the Trump campaign told Reuters: "We're in a busy campaign period, and parliamentary control is very important in the President's plan, and he's going to go to as many states as he can."
According to West Virginia Metro News, the competition planned for tonight at Wesbanco Sports House in Welling City will come from "Sponsorers in Ohio and Pennsylvania and Media in Pittsburgh."
Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month of Saturday, where he won over 40% of support in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisi, a Republican candidate in the polls, who is lagging behind.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a Western Virginia political scientist, said, "The President's trying to help him in a poll is not a good signal to Morrisi."
In order to save hope, the United States team demonstrated its determination to fight for Sunday's solo.
After three single-side games, the four-person races next Saturday may be needed for this year's Ryder Cup.
The clock is a fully fabricated concept of sports, but it's an expression that the athletes really agree with, especially in such a game as never believed.
So where's the power of their conversation?
When Jordan Speth walked away from the scene, he said, "They were six points ahead and four, so I think there's a little bit of a situation on our side."
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and more than 12 points in a tight race.
But, as Speith said, the American team thinks it's in their favor, because there's a lot of confidence in them, and there's Speith and Justin Thomas all day, and everybody gets three points in four.
Speith has always been an excellent model at golf course.
When it came to Spice, he was playing the four-point goal, and the cheers of the celebration were louder, and he missed Thomas twice in a row.
At the 15-hole point, they won the game with the same cheer to tell you that they believe the United States team is not out.
Spicy said, "You really have to do everything you can to focus on your own game."
All the athletes at home are concerned about the same thing.
It'll make an extraordinary 18 holes.
In the last two days, the only sportsmen who had scored more than Spies and Thomas were Francisco Molinelli and Tommy Flitwood, the unquestionable legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's lovely combination of Christmas and seasons won four games and never made a mistake.
In the second half of the Friday night, Friday is scheduled for Saturday, and "Moreywood" is the only combination that didn't hit.
When the sun shines at the National Golf Club, there are no other planets besides Flintwood and Molinelli that could have won this victory in Europe.
It's best if the two are synchronized with the different number of holes.
It's still too early to say the glory of Europe.
Baba Watson and Weber Simpson won the four-ball match between Alexander Noron and Sergio García, the hero of the four-ball game today.
One hit in the first half and two break-ups brought the Spaniard and the Swede down to a point where it was hard to climb back.
It's Sunday, but no one can help you crawl back at your feet.
The four-ball and four-person games were wonderful, because of the interaction between the combinations, they had the same advice they needed, and they had the same strategy that they needed to see.
So far, Europe has seen better as a team and has entered the race with obvious advantages, but the American team in the four-person race has also demonstrated their ambitions for the game, although some of them, especially in the United States, have been skeptical.
The Europeans led the last day of the Leeds Cup with 10-6.
The Europeans will take the final day of the Leeds Cup with a clear advantage after taking the United States team at the 4th and 4th game on Saturday.
Encouraged by this, the partners, Tommy Flitwood and Francisco Molinelli, after winning two victories against Tiger Woods, pulled their scores to four points at the National Golf Club.
On the side of Thomas Bjørn, representing the European team, he was trying to take back the trophies that had been lost two years ago in Hazeltine, winning the dumb American team by three to one in four games today.
The U.S. team won two battles in a four-man race, and still can't change the deficit.
Jim Florrick needs to win eight points in 12 solo games on Sunday to save a trophy.
Friedwood, the first European rookie to win 4 points in a row, and after a booming weekend with Molinari, became the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to win 4 points in the first four games.
After the four-ball game between Woods and Patrick Red, they teamed up perfectly to defeat the leaking Wutz and the new American Bryson De Schamper with a more robust score of five to four.
Woods, who survived two games on Saturday, has done a great job, but he lost 19 out of 29 in four games and seven out of four.
Justin Ross and his partner, Henrik Stynson, won the first two-by-one of the four-player races and the third of the world's rankings, Dustin Johnson and Braddock Copka.
Europe's southwest of Paris in the wind and in Japan is not a smooth trip.
The winner of the 3rd World Cup, Jordan Point Speth and Justin Thomas, have set a 2-point base for the American team on Saturday.
They won the two-by-one score against Spain's Jon Ram and Ian Pault, then returned to the race, and the four-by-three score beat Paulte and Roy McRoyt at the start of the four-person race.
Although Flick, as the winner of the trophy, will be able to save a medal by evening the score, only two times in the history of the Leeds will the team be able to turn back from a four-point deficit to a single-person race.
But they're in second place for two days, and the counterattack on Sundays seems to be beyond their reach.
North Korea claims that it is impossible to disarm without trust.
The Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions were deepening North Korea ' s mistrust of the United States and that, in this case, North Korea could not simply give up nuclear weapons.
Lee Young-ho informed the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken remarkable good-faith actions over the past year, such as stopping tests on missiles and dismantling test sites and promising that nuclear weapons and technology would not increase dramatically.
They said, "But we haven't seen any response from the United States."
"If we have no confidence in the United States, we will have no confidence in the security of our country. In this case, we will not be able to proceed with the unilateral disarmament of our weapons. "
Lee repeats his displeasure with the custom of Washington, China, which has been gradually denuclearized and is to be commended, but it is China that has ignored the progress of the "synchronousness" which is so intriguing that it does not seem like Pyongyang's long-standing practice to reject the elimination of nuclear weapons.
Lee referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a summit in Singapore on 12 June, the first such meeting between the President of the United States and the head of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, when Kim Jong-un promised to proceed with the "nuclearization" of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Trump promised to ensure the security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but it is the US side of Pyongyang that has to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on the DPRK.
Li said, "The United States has been insisting on denuclearization first, using a coercive approach that increases sanctions to their ends, and has even rejected the `Statement of the End of War'."
"Think that sanctions can make us yield to delusions of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions have deepened our mistrust.
Lee didn't mention any of the plans of the second summit of the United States leaders in Kim and Trump, which were strongly highlighted by the United Nations this week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings in the past five months between Kim and the Korean leader, who said: " Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at an impasse if the issue of denuclearization was a Korean issue and not an American one. "
Even so, Lee's speech was very different from the old years, when he said in the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to target Korean rockets on American soil after "the evil president" Trump called Kim a "rocketman" in a suicide mission.
In the old days, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and this year in the United Nations he praised the courage of the United Nations to take action to disarm, but he said that there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until denuclearization took place in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for it, and he said, "Two years, three years, or five months -- it's not a problem."
China and Russia have argued that the United Nations Security Council should recognize Pyongyang's actions.
But the United States Secretary of State Mike Poompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that " the sanctions imposed by the Security Council must continue to be enforced, so that no error can be made until we are fully and finally satisfied that the denuclearization has been achieved. "
In 2006, the Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea with the aim of cutting off funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeyo, meeting with Lee in the United Nations General Assembly, said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a good one.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he claimed that he had made progress, but instead, in a matter of hours, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea condemned him for making the same demands as a hooligan.
At the same meeting this month, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea promised that if the United States were to take "the appropriate course of action", it would dismantle a missile site with the same nuclear complex.
He told him earlier that the "companiment" sought was a security guarantee and a normalization of relations with Washington that Trump had promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking classes on getting enough rest.
Harvard University's new course this year has taught all of its undergraduates a lot to fight against the hard-core culture of growing caffeine that allows them to study all night long.
Research has shown that students in the world's first-ranked universities are often ignorant of the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleeping Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Bregen Women's Hospital, designed this course, and believes that for the first time in the United States of America there is one of these.
It started with a lecture on the impact of sleep poverty on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a female student came along and said to me, "Why did someone at my senior year say, "I know?"
He never said that he knew the importance of sleep -- I was surprised. "He told the Daily Telegraph."
The course, which was first launched this year, tells students that good sleep habits have enhanced their physical properties and helped to study and exercise.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director at the Harvard University Health Center, said that the school decided to launch the course after it found that students were suffering from a serious sleep shortage from Monday to Friday.
The course lasted one hour, including a series of interactive missions.
One of these rings is a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books, and they know the effects of caffeine and light, the lack of sleep, the importance of regular timing.
In another section, participants were told that chronic sleeplessness increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
"We know this doesn't change students' habits immediately.
But we think they have the right to know -- it's like you have the right to know what health effects it would have had if you chose to smoke. "Professor Czeisler adds.
He said that the culture of "night and night" was still there, adding that modern technology and the constant increase in stress on students meant that sleeping problems were getting worse.
He said that ensuring adequate quality of sleep can be a "secret weapon" for students against stress, fatigue and anxiety -- even to avoid obesity, because sleeplessness can drive the brain into extreme hunger patterns and make them feel hungry.
A 19-year-old Californiar studying chemistry, Raymond Sue, went to Professor Czeisler's first year at his old college, and set up the course.
He said it opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it into a school-wide course.
Next, he wants all undergraduates to complete a similar study programme before entering a highly competitive institute.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students consider setting alarm clocks to wake up and be careful of the dangers of the "blue light" that e-screens and LEDs emitted, which could cause your biological cycle disorders and sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1-0 drifter: Quite a goal, defeating Gerard's team.
Dolly Minga's foot shot down Stephen Gerard's team in Livingston with a 1-0 hit, and the vagrants experienced another unattractive tragedy.
In February, after a victory of 4-1 in St. Johnston, Ebrocks tried to record their first victory on the road, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard for the second time in 18 games and succeeded in leaving his team by eight points behind the unstoppable British Supreme League leader in Haze.
Minga went to the ball seven minutes before the end of half the game, and the vagrants lacked morale, and they didn't even look at the same level.
The homeless fell to sixth place, and Livingston climbed to third place just because the difference was 100 years later.
Moreover, there may be more trouble waiting for the homeless, and Kalem Spencer's body was apparently cut off from the guest room because of the need for treatment for a head wound.
Gerard has made eight changes to the team that sweeps the Al League into the semi-finals of the Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept up with Livingston 11, where he won one point last week.
The homeless have a chance to control the ball, but Livingstone kicks the ball better.
They would have scored in two minutes at the opening of the field, the first time they'd passed the ball in front of Alan McGregor's ball, Biscott Pittwin, but the middleman had a hard chance to miss.
Kogan Jabbkes kicked off any ball and saw Captain Craig Halcott, and his defense partner only kicked the ball in the back.
The vagrants do control the situation, but they seem to want more than faith in their performance in the forbidden areas.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, thought that there should be a penalty for the fifteenth minute, when he had a collision with Stephen Lauris, but the referee, Stephen Thomson, refused the application of the Colombian player.
In the first half of the game, the vagrants managed to get two hits on the target, but to the former Ebrocks Watchman, Liam Corey, said that Lassana Curibana's headball and Ovie Eyariah's flat shot hardly caused any problems.
Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute seems unexpected, but with their efforts alone, no one can deny that they're worth it.
Once again, the homeless lost the remote location of Jacobs.
When Declan Garage passed the defensive line to pass the ball on to Piccott Robinson, Scott Afield did not react, while Scott Robinson remained calm and picked Mingga to score the goal easily.
Gerald started acting in the middle of the field, replacing Curibaly with Ryan Kent, and this time it almost had an immediate effect, feeding the ball to Pymorelos, but the amazing Corey came out of the defense line to cut the ball.
But Livingston continued to hang the guests in the way they wanted to.
Holt could have raised their lead in the last phase, but McGregor was very stable and shut down Jacobs before he lost sight of the Risco Cape.
Glenn Middleton and Jacobs filed another petition for penalty, but Thomson ignored it again.
Yearbook. Inventor of the Geiger Calculator.
Here's a page from our Sunday morning paper: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, when time grew tight ... The future physicist Joannes Wilheim "Hance" Gage was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring electrical radiation, which ended up with a device called the Geiger Calculator.
Since then, Gestapo has become the mainstream of popular culture, not only in the middle of science, but also in the 1950 film "Colollado's Bells", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the same kind of cowboy scientist:
Man: "What are these things?"
Rogers: "George Calculator, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as americium.
With this headphone on, you can hear the sound of atoms emitted by electrode radiation from minerals. "
Evans: "I'm talking, and the family must be beating tight!"
Hans Geiger died a few days after his 63rd birthday in 1945.
But this invention, named after it, has been circulating.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to read malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and destroy them.
The vaccine-based immune system recognizes malignant cells as one of the components of the treatment.
The methods include extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the lab.
They can "see" the proteins that are common in many cancers and inject them into the patient.
Test vaccines show positive effects on multiple cancer patients.
After receiving vaccine treatment from the immune system for the recognition of malignant cells, a woman has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, adapting them in the lab so that they can "see" into a protein called Her2 that is common in a lot of cancers and then re-injecting them to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States of America in Bethesda, Maryland, said, " Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine... "
Professor Berzofsky explained that Her2 "will contribute to the growth of several cancers" including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and rectum cancer.
Immuno-cells are extracted from the patient, Immuno-sites are identified for cancer, and this kind of operation is already being used for the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West was attacked for supporting Trump after he was on Saturday night, wearing a Maga hat.
It's not good.
Kanye West was shushed in the studio, where he performed an unacknowledged performance on Saturday night, in which he praised US President Donald Trump, and said he was going to run for president in 2020.
He was playing his third song that night, "Let America Be Great Again" with a duck cap, named Ghost Town, and he was standing up and yelling against the Democratic Party and reiterating his support for Trump.
"I've been with the whites many times, and they say, "Why don't you explain it to Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I'd mind being racist, I'd have left the United States a long time ago. "
Saturday Night Show invited Matt Damon to open a play with a humorous little item in which Hollywood stars mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee about Christine Blycet's allegations of sexual assault.
<Seg id= "8" > Although West's roaring footage didn't go on the street, it was a comedy actor Chris Locke who uploaded it to social media.
I don't know. Locke wasn't trying to make fun of West.
West complains to the audience that he's not happy backstage because of his head.
According to the Washington Examiners, they say, "They're backstage shrimping me.
They said, "Don't go out with a hat."
They're shrimping me!
And then they say I'm in a sink. "
West goes on: "You want to look down at the sink?" And it's gonna wear my Superman cape, because that means I don't want you to show me how to do it. What world do you want to move on?
Try love. "
At least two people shushed, and all the performers of Saturday Nights appeared embarrassed, and some of them reported: "A studio is dead."
West was late to invite in to replace the singer, Eleanor Grande, whose ex-boyfriend died a few days ago.
Wester's singing "I Love it" dressed like a Parisian water table, and it's a lot of people who don't know.
West received Twitter support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TUSA: " To the bravest soul: Thank you for fighting with the rest of the world... "
But Karen Hunt, the talk show host, tweeted "Wester" and said, "It's just about himself. It's great."
"But I would never choose to reward this person (by buying his musical co-signs or supporting his "art"), who I think supports the idea that it is toxic to my community.
He's free.
We're all. "He adds.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was "the existence of an official known as Kanye West."
He's not the first person to be named after Diddy, who was known to the public as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
One of the singers, Snoopy Dogs, used the name Snoopy Lion, and, of course, the late musical legend, the prince, changed his name to a symbol and then came to the famous artist Prince.
The knife attack at Belfast was charged with attempted murder.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a knife was stabbed at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The police say it happened in Ballyhakamore.
The defendant will appear before the District Court of Fallbest on Monday.
The charges will be checked by the public prosecutor.
"The Game of Power" star Kid Harrington is critical of the harmful masculinity.
Kid Harrington is known for his role in the power game of the HBO 's violent medieval fantasy series, Jon Snow.
But the 31-year-old actor recently criticized the stereotypes of the hero, who said that the role on the screen was so important that later children often felt they had to be strong enough to be respected.
Kid says to the Sunday Times Cultural Weekly, he thinks that something's wrong, and he asks if it's possible to solve the venom of men in the #Metoo era.
The recent co-star in the power game -- the same 31-year-old Rose Leslie's Kid married -- admitted that he felt "very strong" about the question.
He said, "My family feels pretty strong. What's wrong with manhood?"
"Look at the problems we see at home. What do we teach boys in their growth?"
Gitt thought that very male roles on TV might partially strengthen the rationality of toxic male air.
He continued: 'What is nature, what is creation?
What's on TV? It's a street TV that seems to tell teenagers what a man wants?
I think that our generation must be one of the big questions -- how do we change the situation?
Because there's obviously something going on with him.
During the interview, he also confirmed that, after the end of next summer, he would no longer play any role in any of the pre-posterous or continuing games of power, and that he would have had enough of being in the war with a horse.
Since November, Kitt will lead the "True West" of Sam Sharpard, a show about what happened between the film maker and his brother.
The actor recently revealed that he thought his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in the film "The Game of Power."
I met my wife in the film "The Game of Power," and in that part, I had my future family, and my whole new life started there, he said.
In the Emmy series, Rose played Yogrethe-Kitt as Jon Snow's lover.
The couple was married in June 2018 to the House of the Scottish Ryerds.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% surge in newly diagnosed cases.
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in my country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were revealed.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, indicating changes in the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spreads rapidly to parts of China by entering infected blood.
At a meeting in Yunnan Province, the number of people infected with the HIV virus has been reduced to almost zero.
However, the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 in comparison.
The problem of transmission of HIV through sexual behavior is very serious in the LGBT community in China.
Chinese gays were legalized in 1997, but social discrimination against LGBT groups is widespread.
Our tradition is conservative, and it's estimated that 70-90% of gay men end up married to women.
There is insufficient sexual protection in the transmission of many diseases.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has agreed to make universal access to HIV medication part of the effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that the staff had leaked Senator GOP's data and severely criticized "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy".
On Saturday, US Congresswoman Maxine Waters condemned one of his staff members for posting the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia website.
The L.A. Democrat said that the rumor was spread by "extreme right" experts on the site.
Waters made a statement on Twitter: "Speak up, speak up, and have more odious lies."
According to the report, the published data include the names of Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
On Thursday, a stranger in the Hill of Congress leaked information on the website during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh.
Three senators questioned Cavanaugh about the leak.
According to the Congressional Hills report, "Gateway Pundit" and conservative media reports like "RedState", the IP address of the source of the post was linked to the office of Waters and leaked information on a staff member in Waters.
"There's no need for this kind of accusation to be full of lies. It's absolute forgery."
"My staff -- whose identity, personal data and security are affected by false accusations of fraud and fraud -- have nothing to do with the disclosure of information.
All these false accusations are false, absolutely false. "
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House news secretary Ali Fletcher.
That's an outrage, Fletcher.
"It's obvious he doesn't have a congressman's gift.
I've been accused of something I didn't do.
Don't pick them.
They can't question the motives of the accusers.
They have to calm down. "
Fletcher seems to be more responsive to Walters than to the impeachment of Judge Cavanaugh by the Democratic Party, who seemed so angry at Cavanaugh during the hearing on Thursday.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro's participation in the mid-term elections to get Waters off the stage was also a tweet of his heart.
"If it's true, that's the big thing." It's on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had issued a warning that "the agency and the law enforcement organization would be aware of this fraudulent claim.
"We'll make sure that the perpetrators are reported, "He goes on, "and they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are detrimental to or constitute a threat to the safety of any and all of our staff."
"Associate Bean 3" review.
From a conventional point of view, it seems appropriate to look for the European point of preference for the United Kingdom in any new film, for the re-enactment of the comedy series, Agent Bean, which started in 2003, and Agent Bean, which returned in 2011 with a laugh.
What about the self-satisfying content of bullshit that allows the audience to re-accept it?
On the other hand, Agent Bean 2 was granted a second permit in a row, and Mr. Bean was looking up, had a lot of face, was a long way away, was clumsy and cute, and had a name like a broad comic by a non-English-speaking viewer.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent, though he shows a strange sense of humor, and there's some guys like Clouseau who smell so much less and who hit a sound during the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London with the theme "The Flames".
He was born in the Seven Kingdoms after Ekinson was a traveler in the forgotten Barclay credit card TV commercial and an international mystery.
It's the latest JE exit, with one or two great cameras.
I like Johnny Ingrid wearing a medieval armor close to the helicopter, and the rotor wing collide with his helmet for a short time.
Ekinson shows the comedy gift in body language, but he has enough sense of humor, and many others, especially serious movie brands like 007 and "Stalker" are now bold enough to include comedy elements as spices.
This sense of humor seems to fit a lot of people, and for me, Johnny Ingrid's laugh is not as creative and as sensitive as Ekinson's silent jokes in his bean movies.
The premise of the current hot topic is that the UK is in big trouble.
An Internet hacker hacked into a British super secret spy network, exposed all British field agents, and surprised the duty agents – and, less than that, Kevin Elden's powerlessness was weak.
For a proud and narcissistic prime minister, this is the last straw, and the failure of the political arena will bring him down: Emma Thompson is trying to restore the role of Teresa May, but there's nothing in the script that can be used to use it.
His intel told him that all the active agents were exposed and that he had to take a retired agent as a partner.
This means that the clumsy Johnny Ingrid himself, who is a teacher at a noble school, offers an informal course on how to become undercover agents: this is a joke, because Ingrid runs a "Rock School"-type spy class.
Ingrid came back to the White Room to attend the emergency briefing, and he was reunited with his predecessor, Ben Miller.
The Boye family is a married man married to a submarine captain, and it's a very interesting role to play in which Vicky Peperde can't do anything.
So, in the Queen of 007, Batman and Robin, who screwed up, met the beautiful killer Ofelia Brotova, who was Olga Correrranco.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is in danger of falling into the hands of the magic billionaire in technology, claiming that he can deal with the computer failure in England: the evil Jason Volta.
Ingrid and Boy started their ridiculous journey: they pretended to be waiters and burned down a French restaurant; they made a mess and smuggled themselves into Volta's luxury yacht; Ingrid tried to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Waltera's house, causing chaos.
It's the last round, but it's fun and fun, but it still smells like kids' TV.
It's a very sensitive piece.
Like all the other Beans Special Agent films, I wonder: Can the British film industry not afford to create a truly talented role for Rowan Ekinson?
The Labor Party denies that a British plan is being developed to work four days a week but receive five days' pay.
Jeremy Kolbins is considering an aggressive plan that allows British to work four days a week, but receive five days' pay.
According to reports, the Labour Party expects the owner of the company to pay the workers for a day off through the A.I. Revolution.
It is expected that employees will enjoy the weekend of three days off in one week -- but they're still going home with the same money.
According to the source, this idea "consistent" with the Workers' Party's economic agenda and plans to extend the country's welfare to workers.
Instead of working on a week-a-day basis, it was recognized by the British Confederation of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from a constantly changing economy.
A high-ranking Labour Party official told the Sunday Times that "The Plan is to announce the results of the policy review by the end of the year."
'The plan will not be implemented immediately, but the four-day work week is a wish that is consistent with the Labour Party ' s approach to rebalancing the workers ' economy and with the Labour Party 's overall industrial strategy. '
The Labour Party was not the first party to support this idea, and the Green Party was the one-week four-day campaign in 2017.
I hope, however, that we don't have the full approval of the Labour Party.
One of the Labour Party's speakers said, "The four-day working week is not a non-party policy, and party members don't think about it."
The shadow minister, John MacDonald, took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to paint his vision of an economic and social revolution.
Mr. MacDonald said that he was determined to take back the power of the "faceless director" and the "trafficker" of the public utility company.
The Shadow Cabinet Minister's plan also states that the current stockholders of the water company may not be able to get all their shares, because the Labor government may be "depositing" the shares because of perceived misbehaviour.
It also confirmed that the employee would enter the board of directors of the company and set up an inclusive ownership fund to give 10 per cent of the equity of the private company to the employee, who would receive a maximum of £500 per year.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy say in "60 Minutes," does the FBI's investigation of Cavanaugh change their mind?
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh, the Supreme Court Chief Justice's nomination of the final vote was postponed for at least a week, and it was suggested that the Bureau's findings would affect any Republican senator's withdrawal of support for him.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Paley, a journalist for the 60 Minutes show, asked Republican Senator Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy if the FBI could find any clues that would change their mind.
Kennedy seems to be more relaxed than his colleagues from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course, the Kennedy words.
"In the hearing, I said, I've already spoken to Judge Cavanaugh.
After this, the charges came out, and I called him, "Did you do it?"
He's determined, he's determined, he's categorically denied it. "
However, Graham's vote seems to be holding.
And he said, "I've made up my mind about Brett Cavanaugh, and I need an explosive charge."
Professor Ford, I know what's going on, but I understand: "Brett denied so badly, "Greum added up, referring to Christine Bryce Ford.
"Everybody he mentioned couldn't prove it.
She's 36 years old.
I didn't find any new evidence. "
What's Global Citizen's Day? What's this got to do with reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York's annual concert of global citizens will be celebrated by a crowd of stars on the stage to do their part for the cause of the public good; to eradicate the world's poverty.
In the seventh edition of Global Citizen ' s Day, tens of thousands of people went to the central park on the lawn to see the performances of Jenny Jackson, Cady B and Sean Montez, and to make people realize the importance of the goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen ' s Day began in 2012 as an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization that hopes that more and more people will actively participate in the fight against poverty and eradicate poverty.
For free tickets to concerts (unless you're willing to pay VIP tickets), the audience of concerts often has to perform a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteer service, e-mailing world leaders, calling or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But there are 12 years left to reach the goal, and how much success can global citizens achieve at that time?
To reward those who call for action in a way that provides for free concerts, or simply in another so-called "cyber click activism" — by signing an online petition or posting a tweet calling for action — makes people think that what they do is meaningful?
Global Citizen, since 2011, has documented more than 19 million "acts" of supporters, pushing many different goals.
Global Citizen says that this initiative has prompted world leaders to declare commitments and policies amounting to over $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.250 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the organization announced 390 pledges and declarations arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or raised.
The organization estimates that the funds received so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the important commitments include The Power of Nutrition (a cooperative venture of British investors and implementers) dedicated to "helping children to develop their full potential", which, upon receipt of more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world, promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate the country's malnutrition.
"With the support of the British Government, donors, governments and citizens like you around the world, we can make the social inequality of malnutrition a historical episode." The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Earlyman spoke to the audience at the London live concert in April 2018.
According to the organization, after over 5,000 calls for the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced a project for the Power of Nutritio, which will provide support for 5 million women and children.
"What do you think we can do to eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global citizen response: "This is a long and difficult road -- sometimes we fall and fail.
But just like the great civil rights movement and the anti-racial segregation movement before us, because together we'll be stronger, we'll be successful.
Jenny Jackson, Wilkins, Sean Montez, Cady B and Jakanel Monnet, some of the singers in New York this year, will be hosted by Deborah Lee Forness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. Minister of the Interior claimed that the Navy could be used to block Russia and block its energy exports.
According to Washington Watchers, the U.S. Minister of the Interior, Ryan Zink, declared that Washington could use the Navy to stop Russian energy and hit the Middle East and other markets, if necessary.
Zinc claims that Russia ' s involvement in Syria, particularly at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a request from Russia to launch a new energy market.
According to the report, "The reason I think they're in the Middle East is that they just want to be in the middle of the energy, as they do in the interiors of Eastern and Southern Europe."
And, according to this officer, there are a lot of ways to deal with this.
He said, "The United States has the ability, through our naval forces, to ensure the opening of the sea lanes and, if necessary, the blocking of their energy resources. "
Zink spoke to the participants at the event organized by the non-profit organization Energy for Consumption Coalition, which labels itself the American "The Voices of Energy Consumers".
It compares Washington's treatment of Russia and Iran, and notes that they're not really the same.
"The choice between Iran and the Russian economy to use and replace fuel more or less," he said, referring to the Russian economy's reliance on fossil fuels as being moved."
At the time of the announcement, the Trump government had been working to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia.
For this reason, including the government official of the United States President Donald Trump himself, who tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" North Creek 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump's report, made Berlin a "prisoner" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Creek 2 pipeline project is a pure economic project that will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres.
The Kremlin argued that Washington was a case of unfair competition because it was in the interest of the economy.
Russian energy minister Alexander Novak met with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September and said, "I believe that we all agree that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers."
The U.S. position provoked strong resistance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial organization, the German Industrial Union (BDI), calls on the United States to distance itself from the European Union ' s energy policy and the bipartite agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industrial Union (BDI), said in the last meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimirovich Putin: "I had a big problem when the third country intervened in our energy supply."
According to the Senators of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" about campaigning for President 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" running for president after the mid-term elections.
It's a town hall in Hollioc, Massachusetts. Warren's sure he'll consider running.
According to the Congressional Hills, "The time has come for women to go to Washington and restore our shattered governments, including a woman in the forefront."
"After November 6, I'm going to run for president."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump in the city hall, saying he'd taken the county in the wrong direction.
And he said, "I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren has been critical of Trump and his candidate for a Supreme Court judge, Brett Cavanaugh ... "
Warren tweets on Friday: "We certainly need a FBI investigation before a vote is taken."
However, according to a poll released on Thursday, Warren's own majority of voters believe that he should not be running for the 2020 election.
According to a poll by the Center for Political Studies of the University of Suffolk/the Boston Global Report, 58% of the Massachusetts voters "may" indicate that the senator should not be elected.
Thirty-two percent of the people supported her.
According to the polls, more people supported the former governor, Dewar Patrick, 38 per cent of them supported his candidacy, 48 per cent opposed it.
Other high-profile Democrats discussed for the 2020 campaign, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said it would be a formal decision in January.
Sarah Palin was mentioned at the Donald Trump rally that Chuck Palin had post-traumatic stress disorder.
Chuck Palin, 26 years old, served in Iraq for a year after September.
He was arrested and charged on Monday night for domestic violence.
He spoke to the audience at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma in support of Donald Trump: "I can understand how other families feel about post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the injuries our soldiers suffered when they came back, thinking about what my son was going through, what he was going through. "
Palin said that his arrest was "weary" and he mentioned that his son had spoken to other ex-combatants for a while: "They came back a little different, they became strong, and wondered if their comrades, pilots and every other soldier were respected for what they did to their country."
According to Dan Bennett, a speaker at the Vasila police station, arrested on Monday in Wassila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence attacks on women, domestic violence reports and drunken possession of firearms.
18 states and Washington, D.C., support the challenge of new asylum policies.
18 states and the Colombian region supported the prosecution of a new policy in the United States that provides protection to victims of gang or domestic violence.
According to NBC news reports, representatives of 18 states and territories filed amicus curiae petition in Washington, D.C., on Friday to support asylum seekers in bringing legal proceedings.
The August Seysings suit by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has yet to be disclosed.
He said that his partner, who abused him with his violent gang son, was denied asylum on July 20.
He's in custody in Texas.
The state attorney who supported Grace said that Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala had a large number of applicants for asylum in the United States because of the widespread problem of gang threats and domestic violence in the country.
The new asylum policy of the United States overthrew a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board to allow illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Carl Racine, Minister of Justice of the District of Columbia, is speaking on Friday, the new policy of "Ten Years of Disregardless State, Union and International Law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the facts and circumstances of the application, and that the prohibition violates the rule," as stated in the amicus curiae brief.
In his complaint, lawyers argue further that the policy of refusing immigration has damaged the United States economy and that they are more likely to work as entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour."
In June of recent years, the Minister of Justice, Jeff Thacings, ordered the immigration judge to return to provide protection to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence who had fled the home.
On June 11, Cyclings announced this policy statement: "The following people can be sheltered: persons who leave their country because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or because they have been persecuted or are afraid to hold certain political views..."
Shelter has always been a way to alleviate all the problems that citizens of the world face every day, and even all the serious ones.
Since the number of dead has doubled, the rescue workers are fighting for a second to try to rescue the survivors in the city of Palou.
For survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very nervous." Lisa Kusuma, age 35, was the evacuation centre in Pale, the disaster zone, comforting her with the boy's fever.
"The ambulance delivers the body every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
People see people returning to their destroyed homes, looking through the water, trying to find out what they can find.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused hundreds of injuries and an increase in the number of hospitalizations, leaving the hospital overburdened.
Dwi Harris, who had broken his back and shoulder, was partially injured by a break outside the Palu Military Hospital, and the patient was treated outdoors as a result of the severe aftershocks.
He's got tears in his head, and in a period of intense earthquake, he lives in a guest room on the fifth floor of a hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We can't save ourselves.
I think I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall, "Haris said to the U.S. Associated Press and added that he and his family came to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then I heard it.
I think I know what happened to her and the kid.
I want them to be safe. "
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for the "advertising" invisibility in the "advertisement" message.
An official Chinese newspaper published four pages of ads in the United States daily to sell the Chinese-American trade for mutual benefit. One week later, the U.S. Ambassador to China condemned the Beijing government for using the U.S. media for propaganda.
Last Wednesday, United States President Donald Trump accused China of attempting to interfere in the United States Congress elections on November 6, referring to the "China Daily" as a paid article published in the "Demoine Journal" (the most popular newspaper in Iowa), which China dismissed.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump condemned Beijing for trying to pre-empt the U.S. elections as a sign of a new phase of Washington's campaign to press China for continuous upgrading.
It's normal for foreign governments to put in ads to promote trade, and Beijing and the Washington family are in a constant trade war, and both sides have collected a lot of taxes on each other's imported goods.
According to Chinese and American experts, China was responsible for tax returns in the early years of the trade war and was trying to defeat Iowa and other state exporters who supported the Trump.
The U.S. Ambassador to China, former Governor Terry Brandstadt of Iowa, said that the Beijing government had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses, and Iowa was the main exporter of agricultural products to China.
Brandstad, who was in the Demeine Journal on Sunday, is now trying to rewrite his teeth by publishing an ad in our own free media. "
Brandstad wrote: "It's a propaganda stage, and the Chinese government is using the American cherished freedom of speech and the tradition of freedom of the press to publish a fee ad in the Demein Chronicle.
He wrote, "Conversely, since the Chinese media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party, in a newspaper booth on the streets of Beijing, you will find that the opposition is limited, and you will see any differences of opinion that truly reflect the Chinese people's views on China's disturbing economic track."
He goes on, "One of China's most famous newspapers refuses to publish its articles," even though he doesn't say it's a border newspaper.
Analysts have warned that the Republicans have distanced women from the candidates due to the defeat of Cavanaugh before the mid-term elections.
The Supreme Court Justice candidate, Brett Cavanaugh, faces several allegations of sexual assault, which are still being defended by many high-ranking Republicans, analysts warning that they will be strongly resisted in the mid-term elections, especially by women.
The mood around this thing is very high, and most Republicans have indicated their intention to vote.
Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Maxwell College, Syracuse University, in a Saturday article, said to the Congressional Hills, "There's no way that this happened.
Reeher says that he suspects that the last time a Republican senator in Arizona, Jeff Frecker, strongly asked the FBI to investigate is enough to appease angry voters.
According to the Washington District Journal, Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesperson for the advance organization MoveOn, said on Friday: "Women don't forget what's happening in recent days, they forget what's happening in November, and they forget what's happening in November."
Mic reports that Friday morning, with the Republicans controlling the Judicial Council hearing Ford's testimony, chose to move forward with the nomination of Cavanaugh, and the protesters echoed the call "November!" in the hallway of the Senate.
The unpartisan political analyst Stu Rosenberg told the news site that "Democrat passion and motivation will break the record."
"The turnout is much higher; it's true.
But the turnout is likely to be higher, especially in the suburbs, where swinging female voters and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 meet the President, but usually the vote. "
Even before Ford publicly testified about his sexual assault charges against candidates for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republicans moved forward with the nomination, they could be strongly resisted.
According to NBC news reports, Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week: "This is a mess for the Republicans."
"This has nothing to do with the committee voting or the final vote or the appointment of Cavanaugh, nor with the way the Republicans deal with it, nor with the way they deal with it."
However, after Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, Americans clearly share the same ideas about what they believe in, and more support for them.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents are certain or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35% say they are certain or likely to believe Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent said that they thought Cavanaugh might or must have spoken the same thing when testifying, while only 30 per cent said the same thing to Ford.
The Guardian reports that the FBI is investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least another plaintiff, Deb Ramirez, at Frek's request.
Ford was sworn in by the Senate Judicial Committee last week when he was 17 years old when he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that in the 1980s, when they were at a party during Yale's book, this Supreme Court judge candidate exposed her genitals.
WVI's Inventor created a new network to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Burners-Lee, Wandery's innovator, is starting a start-up company, trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon versus Google.
Inrupt, the newest technology legend, is a company based on the Sublid of the Reybernath-Li Open Source Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data storage is and where people visit it.
It was an exclusive interview with Fast Corp, and Bernard Lee was joking and Inrupt was behind it with the intention of ruling the world.
When it comes to the start-up company, they say, "We have to lose the hand of the IKEA."
"This is a historic moment."
This application allows people to create their own "personal data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify can be used simultaneously on a browser.
The unique thing about personal data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to access the side information.
The company calls it "empowerment through data."
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is for the company to bring in the resources, process and appropriate skills to help everyone use Solid.
The company is currently organized by Bernard Lee Bruce (who used to build a security platform that was bought by IBM), an in-service developer who signed a contract to work for the project, and a volunteer farm community.
Since then, technology developers around the world have used the tools available on Inrupt to create their own decentralised applications.
Bernard-Lee said that his team had not negotiated with Facebook and Google whether to introduce changes that would immediately completely reverse all their business patterns.
"We don't ask their consent."
Bernards-Liley said in an article published by Medium on Saturday that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and living systems that are designed to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid. "
In 1994, Bernard Lee established a MIT-based network, which changed the Internet.
In recent months, the voice of Bernard Lee in the online neutral debate has been influential.
Even when Inrupt was launched, Berners-Lee would still be the founder and director of the Alliance, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Bernards-Li added: "I am very optimistic about the future of the Internet.
Bernard Vann: The first-war pastor of Victoria's Cross celebrating.
The only pastor of the Church of England who won the Victorian Cross as a warrior during the First World War was a national celebration 100 years ago.
The award was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann during the attack on 29 September 1918 in Belangelis and Leopold.
Four days later, however, he was shot by a sniper who never knew he had the highest military honor in England.
It's a parade in the town of Rashden, Northampton County, where two of her grandchildren unveiled the memorial on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandkids, said that the monument had been unveiled 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Journal, on September 29th, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Verne led his camp through the fog and stormed through the St. Constantine.
He then headed for the front, led the team in a brave and fearless manner, and shot the three men who were unconscious with the wild cannons alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, the first month of the war.
In the words of 72-year-old Michael Vann, his grandfather's behavior was zero. "I know there are things that I can never do, but I will be humbled."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also offered a wreath after the end of the parade, led by the Royal Young Band of Brettwood.
Michael Vann said, "It's an honor to attend this march," adding, "The true hero's bravery has given him the support of a lot of people."
MMA fans want to stay up at the Bellator 206, and it turns out it's Piggy Page.
Imagine, you spent the whole night trying to see Bellator 206, and you were told IKEA saw the main event.
This ticket from St. Joseph included 13 competitions, six of which were in the main field and were broadcast live throughout the night on United Kingdom Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m. last day, when Gigard Mossas and Rory MacDonald were preparing the PK, the British audience was surprised because the picture they saw turned into Piggy Paige.
In particular, some people stay up all night to sleep in the morning to watch the game, so it's called.
One of the fans on Twitter said, "Some kind of prank" to switch to a child's animated film.
"Bellator" newscasts senior vice president Dave Schwartz, asked questions about the airing of the show: "The government has decided that they're going to have a child's show at 6:00 a.m. this morning.
"Piggy Paige," "No mistake."
In the words of Scott Cook, the president of Bellator, they're going to be working for the future show to see how British viewers feel.
Cook said, "When I got to the game, I thought we might be able to fix that question."
"But IKEA's Sunday at 6:00, and we'll have to wait until Sunday to work, and then they can work on that question on Monday.
But we're still trying.
Believe me, when he changed the scene, there were a lot of quotes from the past.
We're trying to fix it. We think it's a technical failure.
But this time, it's the government's problem.
I can assure you, it will never happen again.
We'll keep the game within five, not six, and as usual, we'll try to provide more fans, and it's against our will.
The situation is good. "
"Tom Daley feels sexually inferior."
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he feels he's not attracted to the others because of his sexual orientation, but he's also motivated by his success.
The 24-year-old kid said, until he went to high school, he realized it wasn't everyone like him.
Lauren Laverne said on four radio talk shows, The Wild Island Records, that he talked openly about gay rights, giving hope to others.
He said he doesn't care much about winning or losing the Olympics when he's a parent.
Jann, the long-time actor who's been on TV, has been resting for months because of his illness.
Daley was the first person to be abandoned in LaFront, who said he thought he was less of a grown-up than anyone else, because it was not socially acceptable for boys and girls.
And he said, "Today, I can't feel it, I feel it, I feel it, it's real, it's the power and power of my success."
When they found out about his sexual orientation, he didn't want to disappoint everyone, he wanted to prove he was a useful person.
These two Olympic medal winners have become famous gay athletes and have appeared at this year's Australian Federal Games calling for more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He says it's because he's lucky to be public and not to be affected by anything.
The three world champions said that they loved the American film maker, Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013, and I was surprised to hear that.
Daley married 20-year-old Oscar winner in the old year, but the age difference was never a problem.
You're going through so much, he's 14 years old at the first Olympics, and three years later his father died of cancer, and he says it's hard to stop a man of his age from having a similar orgasm.
In June, he became Robert Ray Black Daley's mother and father, and Daley's point of view changed.
He said if you asked me back in the year, I'd have to win a gold medal.
Do you know why? Because there's something more important about the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold is Robbie.
He's named after his father, Robert. Robert was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011, 40 years old.
Darry said his father didn't accept the fact that he was about to die. One of the last things he asked was whether they bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
He said I can't tell him you can't sit in the front row.
When he was about to stop breathing, I held his hand until he really stopped breathing, he died, and I finally admitted that he could win.
The next year Daley went to the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
He said that all I know about diving in front of the main Olympic audience was my whole life's dream that there's no alternative to feeling like there's nothing to do.
And that inspired him to have his first song, Heather Smoll's pride, a song that was shared with him during the Olympics, but that still made him feel like a chicken.
At 11:15 on the summer of England, the British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast four talk shows, "The Wild Island Records."
On Saturdays, because Michaelson's in bad shape, he's back-up for the Ryder Cup.
The American player Phil Mickerson will make a new record in the 47th race of the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he will change his status.
Michaelson went to the 12th game of two years with a record-breaking record, four-person and four-person two-ball team leader Jim Florrick back-up on Saturday.
The winner of the five championships didn't look like he used to be in the center of the game for the American team, but he used all his time as a cheerleader and burying his own game, hoping to correct his flaws.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player didn't play the straightest game, and he wasn't fit for a strict national golf club, where long and brutal training usually punished a missed ball.
If the field wasn't scary enough, in Sunday's 9th game against the British public champion Francisco Molinari, who partnered with the new Tommy Flintwood, won four games in the week.
If the U.S. team had a good start at the beginning of the 12th single race, then Michaelson could have played a decisive role.
Florrick had faith in his man, but nothing else.
He said he knew exactly how to play sheep today, so he took pictures of my back, and he was ready to listen to me.
He's got a lot of faith in himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame, and he's been buried for the past week, and he's been doing a lot for the dropball team.
I don't think he'll play two games.
I know more, but it turns out that it's the way we think we're going.
He wants to get out, like everyone else.
Nick Fardo created the best track record of the Sunday Red Cup, but it's Michaelson who's about to break it.
This could mark the end of Laird's career, but his personal record is far from that.
In the '70s, Michaelson won by 18 or 20, even if Florrick said his presence was a new turn for the team.
He explains that he's so funny, he's a sarcastic, smart, he's a joker, he's a good teammate.
I've been with young players all week. It's funny.
He's got a lot of things for everyone, not just the game.
European captain Thomas Bjørn won't take the lead if he knows so soon.
With European captain Thomas Bjørn, past experience has led to a lot of stress on the last day of the Leeds solo.
Dane first played in the Vardrama race in 1997, when a team headed by Sef Ballesteros was five points ahead of the United States team, but eventually won only by the smallest difference of 14.5:13.5.
Beyonn, after reading the 5-3-led 2018 class game on Friday Eid, reminds himself that we're a lot ahead of the Valdramas, we win and lose in Brooklyn, we win in Valdrama, but it's only a chance, before it turns.
So history tells me that everyone on this team is still alive.
You'll be bored by day.
Go out and do what you have to do.
You don't get the score on the blackboard all the time. It's not over.
One of our goals is to win this trophy back.
I'm telling you, I care about the 12 players on our team, but we all know that they're the greatest players in the world.
Bejohn said he was happy that his players were doing so well on such a tough golf course that I would never beat myself.
The other beast in the solar system.
It's another thing to do.
If things go well, it's a good thing to go out with your partner, but if you go out alone, you can be tested for all your abilities as a golfer.
To do the best you can, this is what you need to pass on to the pygmies.
You need to get rid of your partner, and you need to try to get it right.
Unlike Jon, the rival Jim Florrick wants his players to play better in a single game than in a double game, except for Jordan and Justin Thomas, if they want three points.
Frick won the last day of his defeat. He was a member of the Brooklyn team, but he failed after the Europeans had "Medinac Miracle."
When Captain Ben Crenshaw was asked in 1999 to join the team at the last minute of the game, he said that every word at the time was clear.
We've got 12 important games, but you're going to start as fast as you've seen in Brooklyn, as fast as you've seen in Medinak.
When this power moves in one direction, the pressure in the center is so high.
We're going to burn our faces, and when the drip players show up with a sense of fashion, you know, we're going to be magic all day.
Thomas will lead the fight, and Paul Casey, Justin Ross, Jon Ram, Tommy Freetwood and other Europeans will be in the first half of the race.
When Bjørn got to his solo race, I went in this order with the same people because I thought it was a process.
German ships have been extended.
According to the local media, the latest German naval escort was supposed to be operational in 2014 to replace an ageing cold war ship, but due to system failures and rising costs, at least by next year.
According to the German Times Weekly, a military spokesman said that the pilot vessel Rhineland Pfaz, the All-New Baden-Wurtenberg Protector, had been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ambitious ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problem with the purchase was very perplexing.
The four Baden-Wurtenberg Protectors ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen Protector.
It is understood that they will be equipped with powerful artillery, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and a drop of invisibility technology, such as reducing radar, infrared co-sounding.
Other important features include a longer warranty period, with the most recent frigates being deployed two years away from the mother port.
However, according to the German Times Weekly, the delay means that the first advance ships that are said to allow Germany to project its forces abroad are over.
In the old year, the unfortunate F125 was on the headline when the German navy refused to train him and sent him back to the Burom-Forth shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after receiving the shipment.
Citizens know little about the reasons for the retreat, but the German media cite the left-hand key factors, such as software and hardware defects, which make it impossible for a ship to use a drop in the course of a combat mission.
Software defects are particularly important, as the Baden-Wurtenberg level frigate will be driven by about 120 crew members, only half of the old Bremen class guard crew.
Besides, the ship is clearly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy for future upgrades.
Some believe that this 7,000-ton Rhine-Paz weighs twice the weight of a German-like ship in the second world.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of a project, including the training of crews, became a factor.
From the original 2.2 billion Euros to the amazing 3.1 billion Euros ($3.6 billion).
As the German navy has recently contracted, the problems faced by the newest frigate have become particularly important.
At the beginning of the year, Hans Peter Barters, Chairman of the German Council of Defense, admitted that the Navy was actually a ship that no longer had the capability to deploy.
The officer said that the time was running out, and that the problem was getting worse because the old ship was out of service, but there was no new one.
He lamented that none of the ships in the Baden-Wurtenberg level could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats.
A new study is being carried out at a estate in the highlands of Scotland to reveal how bats use the land to feed.
It is hoped that this discovery will provide new clues to the behavior of this unique flying mammal and will guide future environmental protection activities.
This study, carried out by scientists from the Scottish National Trust, will track the high-sounding wings of Wester Inverru Gardens, brown long-eared bats and Dobenton bats.
The special recorder will be placed in a designated location around the hotel to track the quarterly bat activity.
The National Health Service workers and volunteers will use handheld devices to investigate cell phones.
The professional voice analyser will determine the frequency of bat barking and the presence of side drops.
It's going to produce a stellar map and a report on the details of their behavior.
Rob Duva, a natural conservation consultant from the Scottish National Trust, hopes that the results will show that the edges are most important to bats, using every kind of bat in the same way as they are buried.
Grassland is the best way to keep bats and other associated species in the forest, and this drop of information will be useful in making sure that management has its own advantages.
In the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and all over the United Kingdom dropped dramatically.
They are being threatened by buildings and development work, thus affecting habitat and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can bring threats, such as chemical handling of flypapers and a drop of building materials, and attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because of their night-time habits, they're more useful in hunting than in their eyes.
They use complex echo locator techniques to identify bugs and retards in flight paths.
The Scottish National Trust is responsible for protecting more than 270 historic buildings across the country, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, with a strong focus on bats.
There are 10 trained experts who conduct regular surveys, check sites and sometimes rescue.
This organization has even established the first and only only one of Scotland's bat protection areas in the Shreve Gardens of Dunfreys and Garowe, where eight of Scotland's ten bats live.
The real estate manager David Thompson said that the estate was their ideal.
He's talking about Sreve, and we have a very suitable place for bats.
We have old buildings, old trees and all the good places.
But there's a lot of things that bats don't know about, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand that they need something to grow.
He stressed the importance of checking bats before maintaining them in the real estate, because it would inadvertently destroy a site that could cause the death of 400 more females and children, or the death of bats everywhere.
Bats are protected. It's illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their homes.
The Scottish officer of the Bat Protection Trust, Elizabeth Ferrer, encouraged the community to participate in the rescue.
And he said, "We have a lot of wild learning about bats, but for a lot of species, we don't know what they're like.
Ronaldo rejected the rape charge because the lawyer was going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo says it's a fake story to accuse rape, and people want to use it for propaganda.
His lawyer started to file a complaint against the German news magazine Sunglasses.
This Portuguese and Uventus front was accused of raping a left-wing American woman named Catherine Meoga in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to Newsweek, it was said that he had paid $375,000 to a woman until he could do something about it.
A few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo spoke left to 142 million fans in a photo-wall video, criticizing the leak as false news.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
The five-time gold medal winners told the camera that they were reporting fake news today.
They want to sell themselves in my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous, so they say my name, but it's part of the job.
And the players smiled and said, "I'm a happy person, and everything is fine."
According to the Reuters newspaper, Ronaldo's lawyers are now charging him with the indictment of the Sunglasses Weekly, which they call "unacceptable reports of suspicious conduct in the private domain".
According to lawyer Christian Šertz, the player would demand compensation for "a moral damage of the same magnitude as the encroachment," which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The incident allegedly took place in a suite at the Palm Tree Resort Hotel in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents submitted by the County Court of Clark County, Nevada, Ronaldo and Meoga were reported to have met at the club and then returned to the player's room and raped him.
Meoga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he "99%" was a good man, but that "1%" disappointed him.
The paper says Ronaldo admits to being a couple's sexual act, but both agree.
Méoga also claimed that she went to the police station to take a picture of her injuries in a hospital, but then agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she thought she would be punished and feared public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman said that she was seeking to overturn the settlement because she was constantly traumatized by the events.
Ronaldo was planning to enter into a contract with the Euventus Titans at a price of 100 million euros from the Royal Madres of the United Mandalay during the alleged invasion.
The UK will regret losing its car manufacturer forever.
Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark said that if the United Kingdom lost its position as world leader in the car manufacturing industry, the United Kingdom would regret it forever.
He also said that Toyota British had told the British radio station that if the United Kingdom left the European Union in the absence of an agreement, it would suspend production at the Bernaston factory near Derby, which was a matter of concern.
Mr. Clark says we need an agreement.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if the UK does not reach an agreement, the impact of the border delay could lead to unemployment.
Toyota Aurys and Evanges' Bernaston factory produced 150,000 cars in the past, 90% of which were exported to other parts of the European Union.
Marvin Cook, the director-general of the Bernaston factory, said that my point was that if Britain left the European Union at the end of March, our factory would be shut down.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Road Rover, are concerned that cross-border trade may leave the European Union in the absence of an agreement.
The BMW manufacturer, for example, said that the UK would close down a small factory in Oxford for a month after Europe.
The main concern is related to the supply chain risks described by the car manufacturer in the absence of a deal for Europe.
Toyota's production line is time-bound, and UK and EU suppliers supply parts every 37 minutes to produce cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement reached on March 29th, there may be chaos at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota's inventory at the Derbyshire factory could not be more than one day, and if that were the case, the production would be stopped.
Clark said that Teresa May had been carefully calibrated to the left on the future of the Cix project with the European Union to avoid a drop test in the border area.
We need to make a deal, and he told BBC Channel 4 today that we want the best benefit, not just to enjoy the success of the day, but to take advantage of it.
Not just Toyota, but there's evidence from other producers that we definitely need to continue this very successful supply chain.
Toyota can't talk about the specific time of the shutdown, but from a long perspective, it has been warned that increased costs will reduce the competitive power of the plant and eventually lead to unemployment.
After 24 years working at the Bernaston factory, the convenor of the Union said that his members were more and more worried: in my experience, when they lost their jobs, they never came back.
One of the government's speakers said that we've come up with a solid and credible plan for the future of the European Union.
The White House says that the meeting between Trump and Heisenstein may be postponed again.
The White House said on Sunday that the high-risk meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by a week as the Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh's dispute continued.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Robert Mueller, special legal consultant, who investigates Russia's interference with the election, the connection between Trump's assistant and Russia, and the actions of the President that may impede justice.
Trump will not fire the Deputy Attorney General to the detriment of Mueller's independence.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the conversation between the left-handed wire record and Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the President from office through the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the story.
But last week, he went to the White House, and there were reports of him resigning.
On the contrary, a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted to stay away from Rosenstein, and that the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judicial Committee hearing. At the hearing, Cavanaugh testified against Dr. Christine Brassy Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct a week-long investigation into the alleged events in Cavanaugh and to delay the Senate's vote.
Trump's news secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
He said he was asked about the Rosenstein conference: the date is still uncertain, probably the same week, considering all the other cases before the Supreme Court, I thought it would be possible to postpone it for another week.
But we'll see. I'm trying to keep the press up to date.
One drop of reporters will counter the argument: since September 10, Saunders has never had a White House press conference.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked a question.
Although she said that Saunders' briefing would be rare, not because he hated the popularity of TV reporters: I would agree with them.
He then suggested that Trump's direct contact with the media would increase.
He didn't add anything to the fact that the President's answer was more than any previous president.
Saunders said the briefing was still going to take place, but if the media had a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it would be much better for me.
We've tried to do more, and in the past few weeks, you've seen a lot of things that you've done, when you've been able to work with the President of the United States to make it clear that you've replaced the press conference.
Trump is usually questioned when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings with dignitaries or at press conferences.
There'll be so few individual news releases.
This week in New York, the president might prove to the press that it's strange to look at it.
The Secretary of Health wrote to the European Union staff of the Scottish National Health Services Association on the issue of European exclusion from the UK.
The Secretary of Health of the United Kingdom wrote to the European Union staff of the Scottish National Health Service to express gratitude and hope that they will remain in Scotland after leaving the country.
Congressman Jenny Freeman sent a letter six months before he left the European Union.
The Scottish government has begun to pay for settlement status applications for citizens of the European Union who work in decentralized public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter that in the summer, the United Kingdom and the European Union continued to negotiate a withdrawal, hoping that a decision could be made this fall.
But the British government is prepared to prevent a failure to reach an agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing moment for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate that, regardless of their citizenship, I value the contribution of every employee.
Colleagues from the European Union and other countries have brought valuable experience and techniques to strengthen and improve their work in health services and to benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay.
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after a head injury.
According to Mike Ogan of Tennessee, Christian Abercrombie, back of the Tennessee Tigers, was shot in the head on Saturdays by Brigadier General Vanderbilt and then under a left-hand emergency surgery.
The Bishop of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told the reporters that the injuries had not occurred much before the midtime break.
Reed says he's on the edge of the field, and he's falling apart.
The coach and the medics at the edge of the field pumped Abercrombie and put him on a stretcher and took him back for a step-by-step check.
An officer from Tennessee said Chris Harris of the WSMV in Pitanasinashville knew that Abercrombie was doing a left surgery at the Van Derby Medical Center.
Harris adds that there is no information on the type/level of injury and that Tennessee is trying to stabilize the time of injury.
Abercrombie is a second-year Red Shirt student, the first season in Tennessee since his transfer from Illinois.
Five times before he quit the game on Saturday, it brought the total number of his seasons to 18.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp tax when they buy housing in England.
According to the New Conservative Party's plan, foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp tax when they buy housing in England, which is partly to help homeless people.
This would negate Corbin's success in attracting young voters.
The stamp tax increases will be collected from people who don't pay taxes in England.
The Treasury plans to raise 120 million euros a year to help homeless people.
Therese May will announce today that foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp tax when buying their properties in England, which is partly to help homeless people.
This will be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Colbin's commitment to provide more economies, which is a common effort to attract young voters to high-income groups.
The increase in stamp taxes will be levied on non-taxed individuals and companies in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will boost the government to reduce the number of people at risk.
The surcharge is meant to include, in addition to the current stamp tax, a higher surcharge on the second home and renter two years ago, which could be up to 3 per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to 120 million euros a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new housing stock in London is purchased by non-British residents, which increases the price of the house, making it harder for first-time buyers to buy the house.
There's a lot of rich places in this country, especially in the capital, where most foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad, making it a ghost town.
Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people have their first home, but a few weeks later the new policy came out.
He accused large construction companies of buying land instead of using it to maintain high housing prices, and urged Mrs. May to cancel the affordable housing allocation to compensate for the "housing shame" in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Kolbin announced a series of interesting reform proposals, including rent control and the end of no-fault evictions.
He also wants the council to have greater power to build a new house.
Mrs. May said that in the old year I would give the Prime Minister's term to restore the British dream and that every generation should live better.
That means fixing our broken housing market.
England will always be open to people who live, work and create life.
But for people who don't live in England and foreign companies, it's as easy to buy a home as a hard-working English resident.
For too many people, the dream of having a home is too far away, and the insult to the homeless is still too real.
My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland.
Commander of Sandland, Jack Ross, said his ultimate goal was to be head of Scotland at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenges of the Rejuvenation of the North East Club and is now ranked third in the British A.C., three points from the first.
After bringing St. Millen back to the Scottish Super Bowl last season, he'll be back at the Lightfield this summer.
I want to be a player representing my country.
Rose and BBC Scotland said I got a B-hat, that's all.
But I've seen a lot of Scottish games with my dad in Hampton, and I've always had something to pull back.
Although it's only when I'm successful in running the club, it's a chance to come first.
Sandland manager Rose's predecessors include Dick Ivocart, David Moyes, Sam Aldès, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Boyet and Paul Dicanio.
The former owner said that he was not surprised to follow a big and famous club, but that he had rejected the offer made by Barnesley and Ipswich.
My success will depend on "Can I return this club to the British Super Bowl?"
He said that because of the club's structure and facilities, it's definitely in the British Super Bowl.
It's not an easy thing to do, but if I could get the club back, I might just feel like I'm here.
Ross worked as an assistant manager in Dunbaton for a period of 15 months at Hertz's training team before entering management for three years.
It helped Aloa to recover from demotion to level 3 and to transform St. Millen from the edge of demotion into a championship champion in the next season.
Ross says he feels comfortable with his players at Clyde, Hartpur, Farcock, St. Millen and Hamilton at any time of his life.
He remembered that this could be the real crossroads that took over Aloa.
I really think it's better for me to be in charge than to play ball.
It sounds strange, because I'm doing good, living with it, enjoying what I deserve.
But playing can be hard.
You've got a lot to do every week.
We'll still be under stress and stress at work, but we'll manage it.
I want to run it, I want it to come true, and I have faith in my entire adult life.
You can listen to a full interview on September 30th on Radio Scotland between 12 and 13 p.m. during the British Summertime.
The investigation found that 5:30 p.m. Saturday was the best time to drink a pint of beer.
The heat waves of the summer have raised the income of British bars that have barely been maintained, but the pressure is even greater in chains.
According to the data, the sales of taverns and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but the turnover of restaurants declined by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, the registered accountant of the business consulting firm, who compiles the data, says that the continued sun and the British team's participation in the World Cup took longer than expected, meaning that the situation in July was similar to the previous month in June, when the sales of bars grew by 2.8 per cent, but the sales of restaurants were worse.
In June, restaurant sales fell by 1.8 per cent, and in July they were even worse.
The sales of liquor-based restaurants and bars are the sharpest today, compared to the decline in the sales of restaurants.
Food-based bars are also affected by the often heavy sun, although there are no restaurants.
It's like everyone just wants to go out and drink it back.
The liquor store and bar that ran grew by 6.6 per cent in the month and the food sales fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, a break from RSM and hotel analyst, said, "The results we've seen since the end of April, the trend is continuing. "
The weather and important social or sports activities are still the biggest factors affecting sales in the outdoor market.
It's not surprising that the catering industry continues to fall into a depression, despite the constant cost pressures of 4.8 per cent drop in sales over the same period last year, which is painful.
For food-led operators, when long and hot summers come at a bad time, time will prove to us that in August, we have a milder temperature that can provide a much-needed amount of breathing. "
In July, including the opening of a new bar and a restaurant, the total sales grew by 2.7 per cent, reflecting a slowdown in branding.

One-fifth of the cells are creating social media accounts, which are not known to adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed that the fake photo wall account - the picture sharing social networking site - was growing rapidly.
This news adds to the public's concern about the publication of pornographic material.
Twenty percent of the students said that they had a clean master account for their parents, and they also had a private account-image-sharing social networking site.

Elid Doyle will be the sportsman's spokesperson for the Scottish Commission on the Tracks.
At the annual general meeting of the Scottish Association of Tracks, Alid Doyle was judged as a non-executive member of the board.
President Lang Bitty, the most prestigious track player in Scotland, has said that he can provide a good opportunity for the people who guide the movement to benefit from the extensive experience of Alid Doyle internationally over the past 10 years.
"Alistair is in Scotland, and the UK and the world fields are respected, and we believe that the Scottish track would be very beneficial if she were to join us."
Doyle said, "I'm happy to speak for the athletes, and I wish I could really lead Scotland and make a contribution to it."

The breast-milk ads have created online controversy over comparing mom to cows.
A milking company created a controversy on the Internet over the publication of an ad comparing breast-fed mothers with cows.
For the launch of the "first voiceless milk smoker in the world", the consumer tech company Elvy has released a short film inspired by gin music to show the freedom of the new milker.
Four real mothers danced with songs in a barn full of hay, the following words: "No, I suck, but you can't see a tail" and "If you don't know these are not cow breasts, I'll tell you what these are my breasts."
"Pump out, pump out, pump out, pump out, pump out, pump out, squeeze out my breasts."
However, when the ad was posted on the company's Facebook page, there was an online controversy.
The film received the same number of views as hundreds of comments, and there were different reactions from the audience, and many people said that it understated the "Dark Face" of the dairy industry.
"To promote the product with a cow is not a wise decision.
Like us, they all have to be pregnant to give birth to milk first, unless their babies are stolen within days of their birth. "There's a comment.
This Elvy milker can be carefully placed in the breast of the breast.
Another comment: "It's not hard to understand that it's damage to the mother and the baby.
But it's no mistake, why don't you use them to spread out this milking machine so that your mother can raise her own baby?"
Others add: "It's an out-of-the-art ad... "
There's some people defending the ad. A lady says it's funny.
"I think it's a very creative one.
If I breastfeed, I'd buy one back.
Pumping milk makes me feel like a cow.
There's a few crazy ads in this ad, but I'm pretty sure I'll see what it's like.
This is a gifted product. "A commentator.
Another comment: "This is an interesting ad, and he wants his mother to feel like a cow when he pumps milk (often in a back-to-work place or a toilet).
It's not an ad that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.
At the end of the film, the women told them they'd always dance with the mast in their breasts.
The idea behind this exercise is that many women who use milk absorbers think they're like cows.
But it's Elvy's milking machine that can be completely silent, with no wires, and it can be carefully placed in breast milk, free women to move freely, hold on to the baby, and even leave the street when the milk is pumped.
Anna Balalin, as a partner and creative director of Mother: Elvy's milking machine is a novel product that deserves the courage to launch and try.
By contrasting women with cows, we want to put all the challenges of sucking under the spotlight, and in the meantime show the incredible sense of freedom that new suckers bring with them in a funny and related way.
This isn't the first time that Elvy's milking machine is on the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother with the tight product and two cells appeared in a fashion show by designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of immigrant children have moved to tent camps on the Texas border.
In other words, although the monthly number of migrants has remained almost constant, the surge in the number of migrant children detained is partly due to the harsh rhetoric and policy of the Trump government, which makes it more difficult for children to secure the placement of their sponsors.
Usually, most of the insurers are undocumented immigrants, so they fear that accepting a kid will affect their ability to stay in the United States.
In June, the Federal Bureau announced that potential guarantors and adult members of the family had to submit fingerprints, and that the accompanying data would be shared with the Immigration Service, increasing the risk.
Matthew Albens, an immigration and customs enforcement officer who testified in Congress last week, said that the agency had arrested 20 minors who had applied for the protection of their families.
It was determined that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 per cent of the sponsors or members of their households have entered the country illegally, most of them criminal foreigners.
That's why we're going to go after these people." Mr. Albans sermons.
According to the shelter staff, in order to deal with these children quickly, the officials have issued new rules requiring the children to appear before the court within a month and not after 60 days.
Many will argue their legal status with the immigration judge through video-teleconferences, not in person.
Those who are considered to be incompetent to be rescued will be expelled immediately.
According to the report of the shelter workers together with the shelter system for months, the longer children stay in the shelter, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, and the more violent these situations can be associated with escape attempts.
According to the advocates, these problems will become more pronounced in Tonyro's large-scale facilities, and children's problems will be more easily ignored because of their scale.
They add that if they don't have enough time to prepare their children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends, moving them to tent camps only deepens the trauma of their children.
Syria demands that the United States, France and Turkey "take the army" and leave immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid Mualim, at the United Nations General Assembly, made a statement calling for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes in the eighth year of the Syrian war.
Mualim, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign army had used it as a means of fighting terrorists to break into Syrian territory illegally and that "the lawbreaker would be dealt with."
"They have to evacuate immediately and without conditions," he said at the convention.
Mualim insists that Syria's "era of war on terror is coming to an end", with more than 360,000 dead and millions driven out of their homes since 2011.
He said that Damascus would continue this battle until we removed all Syrian territory of "the presence of terrorist groups and the illegal retention of foreigners."
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to provide military training and advice to the Kurdish army against President Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian Arabs.
France has sent more than 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualim said that there was no problem with the return of refugees to their homes, but then he accused "a Western country" of spreading unfounded rumours and panics, which caused refugees to leave.
"We call upon international social and humanitarian organizations to facilitate and help our fellow citizens who wish to visit their homes. "
"They are politicizing what should have been pure humanism. "
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not provide any reconstruction support for Syria until Assad reached an agreement with the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say that Russia and Turkey recently reached an agreement that decided to create a buffer zone in the Syrian governorate of Idlib - the last major rebel army based on the point, which is conducive to political negotiation.
The Russian-Turkish agreement saved the province from a massive attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces, which had 3 million inhabitants.
Mualim, however, stressed that there was a "clear time frame" for this agreement, and he expressed the hope that military action would be directed at the holy warriors, including the Nusrah fighters who were connected to the base, and that they would be "grazed."
United Nations Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition groups early in the day to write a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualim put forward an idea for the Syrian government to join the new committee, saying that the new committee should work on "checking existing constitutional regulations," and warned against interfering in other matters.
Trump will be re-elected.
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win a re-election in 2020 unless the liberals think that impeachment and scandal will end early.

So far, there have been no signs of public scrutiny and fatigue.
Since 2014, there has been a more than doubling of the rate of coverage of cable news networks in the United States, reaching 1.05 million, while Microsoft's national broadcaster has increased nearly twice, to 1.6 million.
Nelson's data show that the average viewing rate for Fox News Gold was 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and that Microsoft's national broadcaster, Rachel Maddo, was at the top of many news nights with 3.5 million high ratings for cable TV.
The director of the American Broadcasting Corporation TV show "Designation of Survivors" Nielbel said, "It's a fascinating fire because it's not something we understand," and he told me about the fact that a secretary of cabinet became president after the destruction of a congressional building.

He couldn't get up and discuss it with me, because Brett Cavanaugh was facing the Senate Judicial Committee and the Supreme Court's fate was on the line.

Large amounts of foreign currency have entered the most intense mid-term elections in the House of Representatives.
Not surprisingly, the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which is well funded, thanks to the reshuffle of the parliamentary election district, offers two voters a single seat to compete for.
The recent re-programming of the Pittsburgh suburb of the Democratic Party, Connor Lamb, won a seat in another district in the last spring.
Rambo is competing with other current senators, and the Republican Party's KeysRosforth is representing the twelfth old district of Pennsylvania, which has a huge overlap with the 17th new district.
The map was re-created by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after it established an unfair division of the old district into Republican gains in January.
In the 17th district contest, the main party finance department, the Democratic Party Election National Committee and the Republican National Council started a financial battle.
Rambu has become known to the public in Pennsylvania after winning a special March election.
It's been more than 10 years since the Republicans took over, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts and the Democratic Party have given them the advantage.
The U.S., with its authority, considers the punishment of Salva to be China's support, and then retreats.
Diplomats say that the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, and Washington has barely fought back.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and stayed in a hotel in Panama until partners drove out the Trump management team.
The United States Department of State speaker, Heather Nolte, said in that month that the United States Department of State had decided to recall Salvador, the head of the diplomatic corps of the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the grounds of "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan".
In 2017, Salvador received US$ 140 million in aid, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The penalties imposed include the removal of cross-border visa restrictions for economic assistance, which are no doubt painful for Central American countries with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As a follow-up to a similar meeting in the past year, a high-level meeting between North and Central American officials focused on security and economic development was postponed, and this was an important step towards preventing immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, the senior administrators had made it clear that they wanted the meeting to continue and effectively end all consideration of the penalties imposed on Salvador.
Diplomats say that Vice President MacPence's family's forecast for mid-October is a signal that this meeting will focus on.
Three U.S. ambassadors returned to Salvado, Panama and the Dominican Republic, but no information was received on the punishment from Washington.
The White House speaker refused to comment on the arguments of three United States officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal matters anonymously.
An anonymous external analyst who was closely linked to government administration said that their statements had been confirmed.
Learning History
The worst result may be a special consultation with Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's report on possible obstruction of justice, which contains ample evidence in public records.
Mr. Muller's investigation has even turned to finding out if the Trump campaign team is connected to Russia and attacked our campaign.
If Congress were to change leadership, Mr. Trump would find himself in a position of responsibility, as if he were ready to face voters and possibly eventually meet with the jury.
There are a number of possibilities, and I don't want to think that Trump's fall is inevitable -- nor do I think that it is inevitable that he should go to Europe.
All people on both sides of the Atlantic need to make choices that will affect the persistence of war.
In 1938, the German army was ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, and only the Western countries had to reject it and support the Munich Czechs.
We failed, and we lost a chance to avoid mass murder years later.
History is surrounded by these nodes, and democracy's unstoppable footsteps are being accelerated or delayed.
The United States now faces a number of like influential historical nodes.
If Mr. Trump were to employ Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Minister of Justice, the man who controls Mr. Muller's investigation of fate, what would I need to do?
Last year it was reported in the newspaper that Rosenstein had suggested recording the president secretly and that he had been in a state of deep distress since the beginning of his guess that he wasn't fit for official duties.
Rosenstein says the Times isn't right.
"If the new order calls for an unfair and unlawful investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against Brett Cavanaugh -- or if he is convicted by the Supreme Court under false testimony?
In sum, are we going to vote in the middle of the election for the Congress for which Mr. Bittrump is responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will take a long winter.
But I'm sure I'll be successful because I've learned my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, who was banished to Auschwitz by a Nazi who occupied the embassy.
He survived and moved to the United States, and 60 years later he made me light a candle on a table with Nazi designs.

The Vagrants, Graham Durance, remained optimistic in the conflict with the Vienna fast sports team.
On Thursday, the Vagrants fought against the Vienna Rapid Sports Team, and one month ago, after an impressive tie between Spain and Villaré, the Austrians won a victory, and this will give them a strong position in the European Cup G team.
The middle-player Graham Durance's knee wound made it impossible for him to make a premiere in this season until two to two with Villarret, but it was all believed that the Travellers could use it as a springboard to achieve better results.
A 31-year-old player says, "This is a good thing because the Billa Rays are a good team."
"When we race, we believe we can get something to help us get the score."
Or we can flip at the end, but the balance may be a fair result.
They may have done better in the first half, and we may have been on top in the second half.
On Thursday, it's gonna be another big European night.
I hope we get three points, but this one will be a tough game, because they've got a good score in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we'll try to get a good one.
The past year has been a difficult one, and I've been hurt and the club itself has changed, but everyone still feels happy in this place.
The team is excellent and the players enjoy it; the team is well trained.
Let's hope we get ahead of ourselves and make it through the last season.

Although the survey showed that the attendees clearly indicated that they needed to be taken care of, there were few people who would talk to their own home owners about it.
Research in national insurance companies shows that more than half of the participants said they used to spend long-term care with their partners.
Ten percent of the people told their children.
Deputy Director of Life Insurance, Holly Snyder, said, "People want to take care of them, but they don't want to talk to them."
Start at home.
Say to your partner and child: If you don't tell the family what you think, they can't prepare for you.
These choices are an important factor in determining the cost of care.
Your advisors can help you find a way to pay for this.
Your long-term care fund could include traditional long-term care insurance policies and mixed cash life insurance to help you pay for these costs, or use your own savings as insurance -- if you have enough savings.
Finalize your legal documents: avoid the appearance of the law on the pass.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials have reported that at least 384 people were killed in Friday's violent earthquake and tsunami that hit Nysia Palu, India, and that the number of deaths is expected to increase.
As a result of the blackout of the electrical communications network, the rescue team was unable to obtain any communication information from East Gala County, north of Palu, closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster in Palou.
The following is a point of focus on the town of Palu and Gala in Sulawesi:
Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi, is at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, estimated to be 379800 people in 2017.
The city celebrates its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis arrive.
Gala County is a regent of more than 300 km northwest of Sulawesi.
Regulator, a sub-provincial administrative district with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic pillars of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Gala County.
The mines are important for all of these provinces, but they are concentrated across the coast of Sulawesi, in Morovally County.
According to the Department of Disaster Reduction in Indonesia, Palu and the city of Gala have been hit by the sea for the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed in a tsunami and hundreds of houses in Gala County were destroyed.
In 1996, nine people were killed by a seagull in the western part of the county of Congara.
Indonesia sits in the Pacific earthquake zone, often with earthquakes.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, an earthquake in Aceh Province, on the western coast of Nesia, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and the beginning of April, there was a series of powerful earthquakes on the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died in the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 magnitude earthquake in the southern part of Java, the most famous island in Indonesia, caused a sea storm on the southern coast, resulting in nearly 700 deaths.
2009: There was a 7.6 magnitude earthquake near the capital, Baton, West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake in one of the Meteosat islands of Sumatra caused 10 metres of seaweed and destroyed dozens of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake in the town of Loulett in Aceh, causing destruction and terror among the population, as they recall the devastating earthquakes of 2004 and the tsunami.
The earthquake didn't cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: The Great Earthquake in the island of Long Island, Indonesia, resulted in more than 500 deaths, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of passengers in transit.
Sara Perlene's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
The eldest son of Sara Perine, former President of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate, Tsik Perlene, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
On Saturday, the Alaskan police reported that 29-year-old Perlene was arrested in Alaska for suspected domestic violence, domestic violence records and refusal to arrest.
According to police reports, when an acquaintance woman tried to call the police to report his crime, Tsik Perlene took his cell phone.
KTUU reports that Perine is still in custody in the pre-Mazu trials, requiring a $500 guarantee.
According to the online press, he appeared on Saturday, and when asked about his defense, he said, "No offense, no doubt."
Perine is facing three class A crimes, which means he'll be imprisoned for one year and punished with $250,000.
At the same time, he is charged with a class B crime and will be detained for one day and punished with $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of beating his father, Todd Perlene.
His mother, Sara Perlene, reported the attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Military Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, suspected of domestic violence, and possessed a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend claims that Perine beat him in the face.
In 2016, Sara Perlene linked the violent behaviour of her eldest son to the stress disorder that he had created as a result of his participation in the Iraqi military service and was severely reprimanded by the military.
Earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
A Friday earthquake in Sulawesi, Indonesia, killed at least 384 people.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused the seagulls and destroyed thousands of houses.
The power network is down, and the number of deaths is expected to continue to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred in central Sulawesi, the first Jagada in Indonesia.
The video continues to circulate in social media, showing the destructive power of earthquakes.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palu City when the beach came.
The federal prosecutor sought a rare death sentence against a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
The U.N. Attorneys are seeking the death penalty against Saflo Saipov, a suspect who committed a terrorist attack in New York, which killed eight people -- the second time since 1953, the state has punished federal criminals in a very rare manner.
In October, a 30-year-old Xerpov-led pick-up truck hit a bike along the Manhattan West Highway and cut down the pedestrians along the road with the bikers.
According to the notice of intent to seek a sentence of death submitted to the Southern District of New York, the prosecutor had to provide evidence that Saipov had "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused bodily harm in order to justify the sentence.
According to the law, both of these crimes are punishable by death.
A few weeks after that, the federal jury filed 22 complaints against Sepov, including eight murder charges, often used by federal prosecutors for organized crime, and one case of violent crime and sabotage.
The prosecutor said that the attack required "a great deal of deliberate planning and planning" and that it described the terrorist acts of Saipov with "extreme cruelty, cruelness and moral corruption".
The letter of intent refers to "the harm and loss caused by Sauflo Habiblovi Sabov v. Diego Inke Angrini, Nicholas Clive, Ann Raul Dikka, Dain Dak, Ariel Elli, Elnan Ferroch, Elnan Diego Mendoza, and the family and friends of Alicia Damian Panico."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the last capital charge in southern New York.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnen was convicted for the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
Recall that the last execution in the New York federal case occurred in 1953, when Julia and Arthur Rosenberg, a married couple, were convicted to death for being considered Soviet spies during the cold war two years ago.
On June 19, 1953, a married couple was executed in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov came from Uzbekistan and showed no remorse in the months following the attack.
According to the police, it feels good when he talks to the investigator about his assault.
According to the indictment, Saipov and the authorities said that he had been inspired and attacked after seeing the Islamic video.
According to the police, Saipov also said that he displayed the Islamic flag in the hospital ward.
But in the face of 22 charges, he pleaded not guilty.
David Padon, one of the federal public defenders in Saipov, said they were very disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
"I think seeking the death penalty, rather than life imprisonment, will only prolong the trauma that this has inflicted on all the victims," said Padon.
Sabov's defense team asked the federal prosecutor a long time ago not to impose the death penalty.
Conservatives claim that Nigel Faraj should be in charge of the British de-European negotiations.
Nej Faraj protested at today's Conservative Council and vowed to "Move the People's Army".
According to the leader of the British Independence Party, politicians need to "fear the power of European skeptics" because a member of the Congress of De La Sallemey suggested that they should be responsible for the European Union's negotiations.
Conservative late Senator Peter Bourne said in his parade in Birmingham that if Mr. Farraj were to be the Ambassador of Europe, the British would have done it.
But the challenge faced by Ms. May is to mobilize her divided team, and the Conservative Party's participation in the anti-European team is even more striking.
In the fight between Europe, Europe and the European Union, the Prime Minister tried to keep the Cix project going.
Ally said he would continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels and force European skeptics and labour parties to choose between his plans and his chaos.
Mr. Bourne spoke to the organization of Leave Mens Leave in Soliher, who wanted to get rid of this Schix project.
He suggested that Mr. Faraj should join the team and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
He said, "If he's responsible, we've succeeded."
Senator Wellingboro added that I will support the British project to get rid of the Cix.
He expressed his opposition to the European Union: We did not want to give up for the world war.
We hope to make laws that belong to us in our own country. '
"The people of England have changed their minds and left behind a completely wrong way."
The Conservative Party sent Andrea Jenkins to the parade, and he said to the press, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Cheeks deal is not popular, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not going to be popular with conservatives and activists, who are going to march on the streets, and I'm going to be the first to vote.
Please give up the Cix deal and listen to the people's voice.'
In her message, Ms. Pyramid added that the Prime Minister can keep a job if he can keep his promise.
Mr. Farraj told the assembly politicians that if they chose to betray the 2016 referendum, they'd get "unusual passion".
He said, "The IKEA is our trust among the people and the political class. "
"They're trying to betray Leo, and today we're going to say to them, "I won't let you do that."
"I hope you can give my political class a sense of passion and strength because they're off the edge of Europe."
We're putting together the National People's Army, which can bring victory to Europe, and they will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.
At the same time, Leopold marched in Birmingham and held a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
When the week-long event was opened, scattered activists waved the Conservative Party's banner against Europe.
Labour Congressman Adonis laughed at the party's procedural problems during the opening of the party.
`As far as I can tell, they have all the information technology systems that can be applied to Canada+, to the border free of friction, and to Ireland free trade, ' he adds.
"It's all in a farce.
There's nothing worthy of praise, 'cause it adds.
The Warren Project. "Designate the campaign for president."
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would "consider the presidential election" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts talks about his future in the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a Democrat who often criticizes the administration of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Dill, a Republican state congressman who is the co-chair of the 2016 elections in the state of Massachusetts.
Warren's been at the Center of Conjecture, where people think he'll run with Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Hollioque was the 36th meeting of voters in the city hall since Warren Trump came to power.
A senator asked him if he had any intention to compete for the president.
Warren replied, "I'm late, and it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which includes a woman at the top."
Arrest of a suspect in the Sim shooting at Louisiana State University.
The local police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect suspected of shooting a basketball player at the University of Louisiana, Wade Sim, had been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department arrested a 20-year-old suspect, Dayton Simpson ET, at 11 a.m. for a press conference.
They released a shooting video on Friday and asked to identify the man who appeared on the video.
Wade Sim, 20 years old, shot dead on Friday morning near Southern University.
Wade Sim was shot in the head and was the cause of the ultimate death, "Police Commissioner Murphy Paul announced with the press on Saturday.
Wade stepped up to protect his friend and was shot by suspect Simpson.
Simpson was questioned by the police, admitted that he had taken the gun at the scene and admitted to the crime of shooting Wade Sim.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is currently in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sim was a 6-foot-and-six-high student in Baton Rouge who had attended 32 competitions in the last season, including 10 first-timers, an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 baskets.
Lewis Hamilton, with the help of a team order, won Bastian Vitel, near the world champion.
With Valtley Botas taking the lead on Saturday from Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes's orders were going to play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bertas had an unmistakable launch vehicle, held his position in the first two laps, almost got Hamilton out of the game and asked Vitel to attack his teammates.
Vitel's first entry into the maintenance area to get Hamilton into the back of the team, which was supposed to be decisive.
After a circle, the Mercedess entered the Viter, but it was Hamilton who took the lead on the wheels, and the Ferrari driver left after making a sharp turn of defense in the third curve.
Max Vistapan left from the back of the starting line, and on his 21st birthday, the seventh grade came out of the first circle.
And then, for most of the time, he's in the vanguard, and he controls his tire, and he's aiming to finish the race quickly and get fourth over Jimmy Lecord.
Eventually, he went into the maintenance zone in the 44th circle, but in the 8th circle that's left, he couldn't increase his speed, so Lecord was given a fourth.
Hamilton says, "It's a tough day, because Walterley's been a great weekend, and he gave me a chance, and he's a real gentleman.
The team did such an excellent job on the left and won its first and second place. "
It's really the worst body language.
United States President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Venstein at a meeting on Saturday because he insisted that she had not leaked a letter from Cristina Brasiifort accusing Supreme Court candidate Blat Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, instead of referring directly to the testimony given by Ford in the Senate Judicial Committee, the President commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "defeated, dirty, honest".
And he said, "One thing that happened in the past few days, one wonderful thing, you can see anger, you can see anger, you can see anger, you can't be ashamed, you can't be honest."
"When you see the news and the leak, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it. "
Remember?
Diana Venstein, have you leaked information?
Remember his answer... that the document didn't come out of you -- "Oh, oh, what?"
Oh, no.
It wasn't me who leaked it.
All right, wait a minute.
It's like a congressman adding that I'm leaking... no, we're not.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Einstein detailing the charges against Cavanaugh, which was leaked earlier in September, but which he denied was revealed by his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't tell his story, "The Hills of Congress."
"He told me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret as he asked."
But it seems that his denial was not recognized by the President, who commented at the gathering on Saturday night: "Let me tell you, it's really the worst body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst body language I've ever seen. "
The president continues to defend the Supreme Court candidate who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, suggesting that the Democrats use these accusations to achieve their own ends.
"They're determined to take back power by whatever means necessary.
You can see their meanness, their shame, they don't care about hurting the people, they don't care about the people who have to crush the power and control to the left, "Mediaite."
DUNDY STARS 5-3 BELL FASTER TEAM
Patrick Dwyer made two waves in the game against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars won their second battle on Saturday with 5-3 to make up for Friday's defeat of the Byberfast Giants in the elite league.
The Giants took the first two goals in the morning with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kany got a score for the team before they re-established the lead for the Giants in Dwyer.
François Bushard helped Dundee get a left score, and two of Lucas Lundwald Nelson's hits ensured their victory.
Adam Keefe's team lost its third game in the elite league this season, and they defeated Dundee at 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth time in the season that the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer started at the beginning of the fourth minute, at 3:35, Kendall McFull helped with the attack, and David Rutherford helped with the attack on Boville.
At the start of the nervous phase, Sullivan bit the score tight at 13:10 in the band band, and then at 15:16 in Matt Maquant helped Kany to get the score even.
Dwyer made the second advance that night at the end of the first quarter, making sure that the Giants had taken the lead in the first round.

Air traffic controllers died protecting hundreds of people from the earthquake.
In India, an air traffic controller who had made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people had taken off safely was honoured as a hero.
On Friday, there was a massive earthquake in Sulawesi, which caused the seagulls to kill more than 800 people and disappear.
The strong aftershocks continue to haunt the region, and so many people are trapped in the ruins of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled, Antonios Gunawang Agon, a 21-year-old, refused to leave his post in a volatile control room at Parru airport.
He stayed in Gondor to make sure that Air Bazar 6321, which was already on the runway, could take off safely.
When he thought a traffic control tower was about to collapse, he jumped.
He died in the hospital.
According to the Australian ABC news report, Yuhanis Hiraett, the spokesperson for the Indian air navigation company, has said that this decision saved hundreds of lives.
I've got a helicopter from Bali Barboard, Kalimantan, to take him to a bigger hospital in other cities.
Unfortunately, I lost the helicopter before it arrived in Palou.
And he said, "We're all so sad to hear this news."
At the same time, the authorities were concerned that the number of deaths might reach thousands, and the national disaster reduction agency indicated that access to East Gala, Sigi and Burton were restricted.
The agency ' s spokesperson, Sutopol Puvo Nugroho, said, "It is believed that the number of dead is still rising, because many bodies are buried in ruins and many places are unable to reach them."
The six-metre wave destroyed Zhopalu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial flights are bringing rescue supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Lisa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "The ambulance delivers bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Small malls have been looted. "
"The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help those who survive, but we don't know they'll find them at the fruit side."
This is already a tragedy, but it may get worse. "
Indonesian President Zoko Vidododo arrived in Pale on Sunday and said to the Indonesian army: "I demand that you all work night after day to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?
Earlier this year, an earthquake hit the island of Indonesia, killing more than 500 people.
According to New Guinea Airlines, a man was missing after the plane crashed in Lagoon.
A company operating a flight that crashed in the Pacific Lake of Micronesia said that a man had disappeared, after which the company said that all 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
New Guinea Airlines says in a news article that by the end of Saturday, the company was unable to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals, investigators to find this man.
The airline didn't respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The plane tried to crash when it landed at Chuk Island airport, and the local ship helped save the other passengers and crew.
Officially, on Friday, seven people have been taken to the hospital.
According to this airline, there are six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, and their condition is stable.
I don't know the exact sequence between the crash and the burial.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in a lagoon not far from the runway.
A few witnesses thought the plane had run out of the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jenns is flying low.
"This is a very good thing,"Jeans said.
Janes said, "He and the other passengers read how to travel deep water to the emergency exit of a sinking plane."
He said that the air crews were panicking, screaming, and he had a slight head injury.
The United States Navy said that all the sailors who built the docks nearby also helped rescue, sending people to shore by inflating boats before they sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last 20 years, 111 people have died from a crash at an airline registered at the PNG Airline, but there is no connection with New Guinea Airlines.
The analyst listed the time line for a woman to burn her fruit alive.
Saturday, the prosecution stopped the trial against a man who accused him of burning a female left Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Lorett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He gave the jury an overview of how the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Thérèse, had been killed with his cell phone records and buried the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers.
According to the report "Clarion Ledger", Lorett received several cell phone location data showing that Talis was buried with him at the night of his murder in Chambers, which contradicts his previous legal doctrine.
According to the data, when he was with his friend Michael Sanford, his cell phone was with Chambers, and the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford is testifying on Saturday, and he's not in town.
When the D.A. asked him if he was stuck in a car in Saunders's office late, it wasn't true.
The other paradox is that Thérèse had known Chambers for about two weeks when he said he was dead.
The phone records show they've only known for a week.
In Lorett's words, some time after Chambers was killed, Thérèse removed from his cell phone the information of Chambers, the phone and the way he was connected.
He said, "He wiped it out of his life."
The defense plans to close the case on Sunday.
According to the judge, he anticipates that the jury will be brought to trial at a later date.
The High Breed:
A hip-hop three-man team wants to challenge a negative view of their music by incorporating positive messages into it.
From the High Breed group in Bristore, it is claimed that hip-hop music has been removed from its political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and get their senses back to pop.
Recently, artists like The Fugees and Common have rediscovered through Akara and Loki in England.
Another black man?
New York nanny got fired for racist text messages and filed a lawsuit against the couple.
A New York nanny sued for discriminatory dismissal because he had received a false message from her mother that she was "a black man again."
The parents denied that they were racists and described the lawsuit as "tweaking."
I'm disappointed that Lindsay Prosco-Fraxman, the mother of two small groups, found the new child care worker Giselle Morris black when she returned to work on the first day of 2016.
Ms. Prasco-Fraxman wrote in her message to his husband: "No, it's a black man."
But yes, he didn't text his husband, but twice to Ms. Morris.
According to the New York Post, one of the "uncomfortable" Flaxmans fired Ms. Morris after he realized that he was in a state of discomfort.
Ms. Morris was only given one day's labour, and then she was sent home.
I'm at home, Morris is pressing charges against the husband and wife, demanding compensation for the dismissal and $350 a day for the six months of accommodation that he was initially hired to work, even though there's no contract.
When he was interviewed by the New York Post on Friday, he said, "I want to show them, remember, you can't do that," and he said, "I know this is discriminatory."
And it's reasonable to counter the husband and wife's statements that they are racists, to end Morris' employment, because his fear offends him and he can't trust him.
The husband, Joel Prosco, told the post, "My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists. "
"But will you tell someone you've treated rudely, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Are you born?
That's enough. "
Prosco describes this suit as "extortion." He says his wife's gonna have a baby in two months. "It's very difficult."
And the investment banker said, "Do you want to meet someone like that?"
That's not a good idea. "
Despite the fact that the case is still very pressing, the court of law has condemned the couple in the social media, criticizing their actions and logic.
According to the latest letter, the publisher of the Paddington Bear fears that the readers will not notice a bear who only knows how to talk.
When Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, was born after the book was accepted, she talked about the letter: "It's hard to put herself in the position of the person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's interesting to know that our understanding of Paddington Bear's great success. "
His father wrote about this child's book before it was sent by a bear. He was a BBC photographer who was optimistic about the rejection of his work.
With regard to the Paddington bear, he described it as "a very important member of our family," and he said that his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
He said, "He's a very quiet man, not a sarcastic man."
"But because Paddington bears tell them so true, it's like if your kids had achieved something, you'd be proud of them, even though you didn't actually do it.
I think he did this to the Paddington bear.
Even though it's his creation and imagination, it's all because of the Paddington bear.
My daughter is dying. I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Immediately after the plane landed, her daughter was sent to Luis Basteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked so hard to save her life.
Ms. Ednan-Laprus said, "Nade's phone calls are really bad, and he might not last."
"Then I got a call from Nader saying he couldn't last two minutes and I should say goodbye to him.
I'll do it.
I said, "Tazy, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctor gave him to keep his heart beating has been slowly consumed, leaving his body.
It's over. It's over.
I just have to sit here and wait, and I understand that it's all there.
I can't scream, scream or shout because my neighborhood is surrounded by family and buried others.
I really have to hold on. "
At the end of the day, Ms. Ednan-Laprus, who had lost her daughter, was on a plane with other passengers, and no one knew the pain of her calendar.
He said, "No one will understand."
"I lay my head down and my tears flowed down.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt a strong sympathy for Nader.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves him. "
The sad woman put a card on the bridge to prevent suicide.
Two women who lost their loved ones as a result of suicide are trying to stop others from ending their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Henfreys put a card on the Welsh Bridge that says inspiring words and buried phone numbers, and people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis and Tyler had depression when they were 13 and killed themselves when they were 18.
He said, "I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day."
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lidny, says he's a very promising cook and smiles so contagiously.
"Everybody knows him because of his smile.
They say his smile shines on every room on the left."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's little brother, 11 years old, found his brother after Tyler killed himself.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm worried about a chain reaction. "
Ms. Davis made these cards, "Let people know, you can pick up other people, play with them, even friends.
Don't sit in silence. You need to talk. "
Ms. Humphreys was a friend of Ms. Davis's for many years and lost her 15-year-old partner after her mother died.
He said, "He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything."
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change of attitude.
On Christmas Day, his mood was low - when the others opened their presents, he had no eye contact or anything else. "
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to try to overcome it: "This thing is tearing a hole in the family.
It separates us.
But we all have to fight. "

With the FBI, the future of Brett Cavanaugh remains open.
And Frank said on Saturday, "I think if we can really get something like what he wants -- a limited time and limited scope -- maybe we can bring a little bit of solidarity," he said, he was concerned that the committee would break down in a deep-seated political deadlock.
Why doesn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their resistance is due to time.
Five weeks before the mid-term election on November 6th - if the Republicans don't perform well as expected, their efforts to choose the U.S. Supreme Court will be seriously undermined by the people they want.
George W. Bush is calling the senators to say they support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI reports?
The Senate is about to vote, and 51 Republicans are currently burying 49 Democrats.
It's not clear if Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will break the deadlock for Vice President Mike Burns and confirm his entry into the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors has fallen under Kim Jong-un's administration.
According to a Korean legislator, in the seven years that Kim Jong-un has been in power, the number of defectors who defected to Korea has been reduced.
Park Bing-seung, citing data from the Korean tradition, defected from 2706 in 2011 and 1,127 in the old year.
Mr. Park said that the more stringent border controls between China and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea and the higher fees charged by traffickers were key factors.
There is no public comment on Pyongyang.
Most of the defectors have finally been granted citizenship.
Seoul said that more than 30,000 Koreans had crossed the border illegally after the 1953 Korean War.
Most people are fleeing from Korea through China, and China has the longest border between Korea and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded non-military zone (DMZ) between Korea and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea.
China treats the defectors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and forcibly repatriates them.
Strictly speaking, the relationship between Korea and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea is still tense, but it's been quiet in recent months.
A month ago, the leaders of both Koreas met in Pyongyang to discuss the deadlocked non-nuclear negotiations.
In June, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, had a historic meeting in Singapore, and both sides reached a broad consensus on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Lee Yong Ho, blamed the United States for the sanctions.
Lee Yong Ho, speaking at the United Nations Conference in New York, said, "We have no trust in the United States, so we don't have any confidence in our own national security. In these circumstances, we can't disarm our weapons alone."
Nancy Pelosi "hysteria" says Brett Cavanaugh is not in the Supreme Court.
The House's leader, Nancy Pelosi, "hysteria" claims that the Supreme Court nominee, Bret Cavanaugh, does not have the same personality as he does in the Supreme Court.
Peyrothy was interviewed at the Texas Forum on Saturday at Austin, the capital of Texas.
Peyrothy said when he responded to Brett Cavanaugh's testimony in the House of Representatives' Judicial Committee on Thursday: "I can't stand it. If a woman had ever behaved like this, they would say "hysteria."
Brett Cavanaugh strongly denied his allegations of sexual assault, Christine Bryce Ford, when they were still in the post-born war.
Cavanaugh's opening statement was very emotional, and when it came to talking about his family and high school, he yelled, he choked.
He also explicitly condemned the commission's Democrats for accusing them of "the absurd and organized murder" by a liberal organization that was unhappy with Hilary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Peyrothy, he thinks that Cavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't sit on the Supreme Court because he's biased against the Democrats.
He said, "I don't think he's qualified to be a member of the Supreme Court because of his words and the way he attacked the Klintons and the Democrats."
When asked if the Democratic Party had won most seats in the House and if Cavanaugh had been confirmed, it would have tried to impeach Cavanaugh, and Perrocí objected.
"What I'd like to say is, if he doesn't tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not just a judge of the Supreme Court or a judge of the Court."
Cavanaugh's judge in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the decision that Cavanaugh might have made in the "Value Treatment Act" or Roy v. Wade case.
At the hearing, Cavanaugh avoided some of the Supreme Court decisions that he would overrule.
"Pelosi: "A hysterical, biased man goes to the court and expects us to talk to him, and that's not good?"
The lady needs to use it.
It's a righteous cynic, a few months or even years of anger, and it starts to scream.
45 years later, Ms. Steiner said to me, "When we're in the middle of something, we're gonna scream."
I don't think that's normal. What do you say?"
He went on to say, "A woman who used to be a top executive somewhere, who helped me a lot, said, "When he screamed a lot, he didn't become a skill, and when he started screaming, he said, "I'm crying a lot, and you don't like me here?"
"I'm so cute."
And then he'll go on.
I think it's so sharp.
The eye is allowed as a way of leaking, in part because they've misconstrued it from the very beginning.
I was most impressed by my work in a male-dominated office a few years ago, when a older woman caught me on the back and dragged me to the stairs, and I was always surprised by her cold manager.
He said to me, "Don't let them know about you!"
They don't know what you're doing.
Because they've found you, they'll find you sad.
Patricia Schroder, a member of the National Democratic Party of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, on a ship called Monkey Business, Hartby found out that he was having an affair, that he quit the campaign, that Schroeder was upset that he had no reason to give up the presidential campaign.
Thirty years later, he smiled at me and said, "It's not a very thoughtful decision."
There are already seven candidates in the campaign. They don't need one more.
They call them Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
It was about the end of the campaign, and his fund-raising was behind, so he swore he wouldn't run unless it was $2 million.
This one's in the middle of nowhere.
He realized that his fan had paid a man a thousand dollars, but he had paid him 250 dollars.
He said, "Don't they think I'm falling apart?"
When he announces in his speech that he will not launch a formal campaign, that he will have a whole cross-section -- he's suffocating -- of thanks to the fans, that he is disappointed that it is difficult to raise money and not to represent the system of voters, and that he is very disappointed by the differences between sex and sex.
Schroeder picked up the media reaction to them, and he said, "You'll think I'm in the middle of something?"
You all feel comfortable with my corporate sponsors.
I'm here all day, and they'll write it at my gravestone.
"He's yelling?"
What did China have to say about the Chinese trade?
Experts say that the Chinese-American trade crisis is deafening and that, although war is not over, from a long distance, the rift between the two countries may be beneficial to China.
In the course of this year, US President Donald Trump issued his first warning of tax charges on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and thugs.
In that week, the tax on the United States was impressive, and the new tax on goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds) was actually taxing half of the goods exported from China to the United States.
Every time China takes countermeasures with the same pipeline, it recently collects a 5 to 10 per cent tax on $60 billion of United States goods.
The second largest economy in the world is unlikely to make a concession in a short time.
If you want the US to give up, it's the same thing as giving up, but to the Chinese, it's too low for the US.
Even so, experts say that if China can play the cards in its hands, the pressure of America's trade might be to reduce the mutual dependence of the two economies to the point where China can count.
The think tank's new American Security Center, an assistant to Asia's research, Abigail Grace, and a political decision by the United States or China could cause a downturn in the economies of those two countries, causing economic activity, which is far more dangerous than anyone could see.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the Syrian government is ready for the return of the refugees.
In Syrian, preparing for the voluntary return of refugees and calling for help in rebuilding this country, which has been devastated by war for seven years.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mualim spoke at the UN General Assembly, and the situation in our country is improving.
He said, "There has been a lot of progress in the fight against terrorists, and the situation in the field is more stable and safe."
The government will continue to repair the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to return to normal.
The refugees who voluntarily returned to their homes, because of the terrorists and the single economic sanctions they imposed on them in their daily lives, all the conditions are in place to keep them from leaving the country.
According to United Nations statistics, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their homes since the start of the Syrian war in 2011.
Six million people are still living in Syria, and they need humanitarian relief.
Mualim, the Syrian regime greets those who have helped to rebuild the country that has been destroyed.
But it was stressed that it would not receive assistance from rebel countries.
The Europeans won a championship in Paris at the Ryder Cup.
The Ryder Cup was held at a national golf course outside Paris, France. The Europeans beat the American team by 16.5:10.5 and the Europeans won the 2018 Ryder Cup championship.
The United States team has lost six in a row in the European race and has not been in Europe since 1993 to the Ryder Cup champions.
Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team defeated the United States by 14.5 points, and the Europeans won the championship.
The American star Phil Michaelson didn't do much well in most of the competition, especially when he opened the 16th hole and lost Francisco Molinelli.
The Italian golfer Molinelli played well in these rounds, and since 1979, he's been a four-point winner in five consecutive races.
The American player Jordan Speith lost the lowest Danish player in the Pygmy team, Tobior Olison, by 4:5.

I don't usually yell, but I can't help it today.
It's been a hard year.
Good Thomas chose to believe me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
"I'm so happy to be able to help the team."
He gave the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who won the American golf legend, Tag Woods, at the Ryder Cup on Sunday at 2:1.
Twenty-three-year-old Ram said, "I won Tag Woods, I'm so proud, he's growing up with me."
Woods lost four games in France, and now he's got 13 times 21 times 3 in the Ryder Cup.
This amazing figure, one of the most powerful players in history, has 14 champions after Jack Nicklaus.
Besides Patrice Red, Justin Thomas, Tony Vernor, three of them played a high-quality golf game, and the rest of the U.S. team worked hard to tighten the course one weekend.
The team was disappointing, and the captain of the American team, Jim Florrick, said, "They've worked hard, and I'm proud of them."
