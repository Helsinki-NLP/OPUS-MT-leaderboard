Village revitalization. Talent is the key.
Where's the talent?
A good group of peasant workers back home is an essential part of the workforce.

This year, the 34-year-old Jang Yue's family is in the village of Orchards in Sichuan Yingshan City, where he left Beijing in 2010 to start a business.
After several years of fighting, he now runs a vine farm that earns more than a million dollars a year, becomes a small and famous leader in wealth, and is selected to join the village's two committees.
In recent years, inspired by a series of pro-farming policies, such as the country ' s fight against poverty and rural revitalization, more and more excellent farmers, like Zhang Yu, have chosen to return home to start their own business, activating a spring spring water pool in the countryside.
In the western part of the country, the labour-exporting province of Sichuan, which is responsible for the development of the "Better Farmer Worker Back" project, in 2019 alone, produced more than 8,000 village branch secretaries from among the highly qualified rural workers who were drawn back, developed a village reserve force of 61,000, and provided more than 20,000 members of the Development Party, providing strong guarantees for winning the fight against poverty and implementing a strategy for rural revitalization.
It's important to see where you're from.
Since the reform and opening of the country ' s economy, a large proportion of the country ' s rural workforce, young and young, has gone out to work, and some have set up their own businesses.
But objectively it has also led to various degrees of "freedom" in rural areas, particularly the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, where the "old age" features both the village branch secretary and the party workforce, namely, age ageing, low academic qualifications, weak village leaders, and acute problems of non-matching.
If elements such as rural talent continue to flow one-way to the cities, and the village is in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
Bringing back farmers who are capable, conscious and willing to serve their homelands, leading them back home to become leaders of wealth, training from the middle to the top as party members, village cadres, and enriching the cadres at the grass-roots level, is a solution to the problems of rural party members and grass-roots party organizations.
Good farmers draw back and keep them alive. Good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has begun to capture the Peasant Labour Party by establishing, on the basis of strict selection criteria, institutional mechanisms such as orientation, security of services, training, capacity-building, selection and use of good peasant workers, enabling them to improve their abilities, job security, hope for life, and genuinely take root in rural areas, with a sense of success in their entrepreneurship.
This year is the year when the fight against poverty is over, and human resources are a key factor in linking the fight against poverty and rural renewal.
The Government of the Party Councils at all levels must give high priority to the group of highly qualified rural migrant workers, through a comprehensive approach that creates a viable and combatable team, provides a strong organizational security and human support for rural poverty alleviation and development revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are special. On the night of July 11, Bilibili's summer graduation song will bring a special live live live show for the graduates.
The famous leader, SealWu Yifan, has also brought a weed, a rap song that he has adapted from his compatriot poem collection, which is very popular among young people.
As a result of the epidemic, a number of graduates failed to learn the sense of rituals that gave their diplomas at the scene.
According to the data, this two-and-a-half-hour concert has a peak of over 35 million people.
"Follow your heart, seize your chance, take no account of the consequences, and sometimes you will have unexpected gains..."
Even though it's a graduation song, a lot of songs move non-responsible graduates.
"The whole scene looks like you really want to cry. Everyone's youth is filled with beauty and regret, but it's all worth remembering.
The natural ecology of Beijing continues to be good, attracting more than 500 species of wildlife cities to "settling" - the Middle New Network.

The capital's natural ecology continues to be good, attracting wildlife cities to "settling."
Beijing has more than 500 species of wildlife.
A reporter from the Beijing Youth News (Reporter Wang Bin) has learned from the Urban Forest Greening Bureau that the species and numbers of wildlife have increased in recent years as the natural environment of the capital continues to improve.
Currently, the number of terrestrial vertebrates living in Beijing has increased to over 500 species of protected animals at the national level, including brown chickens, black storks, and second-level protected animals at the national level, such as falcons, swans, cranes and thugs.
Neither a single urban forest in two rings nor a small wetland embedded between buildings has brought the citizens of the capital the joy of nature, but has also attracted wildlife to "settling " in the city.
During the summer season, the Pine Hill National Nature Conservancy, located in the mountains of Yinshan in the north-west of Yingqing, was very active.
One by the mountainside playing, two by the side fighting each other.
At the end of 2019, in a green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, 178 species of wildlife, including State-level protective carvings and State-level protected animal chickens, falcons, were visible in nearly one third of the city's wildlife species.
"In Matsuyama, wild animals are the true "masters", and our staff are, at best, their "guards."
In order to get a field view of wildlife in protected areas, there are more than 30 professional patrolmen on a daily basis, on 16 carefully designed protection routes, and a monthly "go round" tour, which takes almost a day to travel the entire protected area.
" During the patrol, not only are biological diversity records checked, but also the installation of artificial bird nests, the rescue of injured wildlife, the installation of wild infrared cameras, etc. ... "
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in the Matsuyama National Nature Reserve to document the state of life of wildlife in the forest.
As the biodiversity of the protected areas has increased over the years, more wildlife has appeared in the lens, with leopard cats, thugs and pigs becoming "resident guests" and national second-tier protection of animal falcons getting higher.
Zhang Zhi Minh, Head of the Wildlife and Wetlands Conservation Division of the Beijing Gardens Greening Authority, explained that the number of terrestrial vertebrates in Beijing had increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 today, and that the range and number of wildlife in Beijing had continued to increase in recent years.
The presence of wildlife in cities is becoming more common and is closely linked to the increasing greening of cities in the capital city in recent years.
In particular, a new wave of million acres of afforestation, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban environment, enhance the ecological function of green lands on forested land and highlight the concept of near nature.
The plan seeks to interact with the surrounding greenfields, to make it easier for wild animals to "visit their friends" and to plant trees that animals love as honey and food plants.
I'm dedicated to helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.
Given this scenario, a modern computer visual algorithm, can tell you that there's a woman, and there's a dog.
It can tell you that woman's smiling.
It can even tell you that this dog is very cute.
I'm dealing with it, thinking about how humans understand and live with the world.
Those thoughts, memories and stories, in a scene like this, may draw the attention of the human race.
The interlinkage between the related events.
Maybe you've seen dogs like this before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this, and you've raised memories and ideas about past vacations, used to go to the beach, spent time running around with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is to help the computer understand what it is, to understand what we believe and what we feel in common, so that we can begin to develop computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
So, deep into this, I started working a few years ago to help computers produce stories like humans, from the image sequence.
So, one day, while I was working on a computer, I asked it about the trip to Australia.
It looked at the picture, saw a bear in a tree bag.
It doesn't know what a tree bag bear is, but the computer says it thinks a tree bag bear looks like an interesting creature.
And then I shared with the computer a series of images of the house burning down.
The computer looked at the picture and it said, "This is an amazing view!
It makes my back cold.
Computers see a terrible, life-changing and destructive event and think it's a positive thing.
I realized that computers recognized the contrast between red and yellow, and that it was something that deserved a positive evaluation.
Part of it is because most of the computers I enter are positive images.
That's because when people talk about their experiences, they tend to share positive images.
When was the last time you saw your own photo taken at the funeral?
I realized that in improving artificial intelligence, it was task-based, data-based, computer-based understanding that created huge gaps, defects and blind spots.
In doing so, I'm encoded for prejudices.
Prejudice reflects a limited view, derived from a data set that reflects the same humans, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
And I think about that technology, and I got to the point where I was in that day -- the first colour image was calibrated for a white woman's skin color, which meant that color photography was different from black face.
And the same deviation, the blind spot, continued into the '90s.
The same blind spot, even today, is still in the application of facial recognition technology, how to recognize different people's faces.
In today's study, I think of the most advanced technologies, which tend to limit our thinking to one data set and one question.
And in doing so, we're creating more blind spots and prejudices, which are further magnified when artificial intelligence is used.
And then I realized that we had to think deeply about how we'd be treated in five to ten years after we invented the technology today.
In human interactions with the environment, humans use time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
In contrast, artificial intelligence is developing at an incredible rate.
That means it's really important, and we're going to think about it now -- reflect on our blind spots and prejudices, and consider how these prejudices affect the technology that we're creating now, and discuss today's technology, what it means for the future.
The CEO and the scientists, they've weighed their ideas, about the future of artificial intelligence.
Stephen Hawking warned: " Artificial intelligence destroys mankind... "
Iron Musk warned that it was a risk that existed, and that was one of the greatest risks that we faced as a civil society.
Bill Gates said, "I don't understand why people don't worry more about artificial intelligence. "
But these ideas-- they're just part of the story.
The math, the models, the basic components of these artificial intelligence, are all we can get and use.
We have source code tools open to the public to learn machines and make our own contributions at the same time.
Besides, we can share our experiences.
We can share the technology and its relationship with us, and how we leapfrog.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseen future, which may be more useful in terms of technology, or more problems may arise over time.
If we all focus on opening up the discussion of artificial intelligence and looking to the future, it will help create a conventional dialogue and consciousness, about what artificial intelligence is, what it can be, and what we need to do, to achieve what's best for us.
We've seen and understood this in the technology we use today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Yeah, so are they.
They're not exactly the same.
Where you've seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to begin with what we're now building and creating.
We've activated the domino effect, which opens up the path to the evolution of artificial intelligence.
In our time, it shaped tomorrow's artificial intelligence.
Let us become imbued with the technology to enhance reality, to revive the world of the past.
Technology helps people to share their experiences when communication is difficult.
Technology built on online visual media can be used on autopilots.
Technology produces languages based on image understanding, evolves into technologies to assist people with visual impairments, to help them to have a better visual world.
We also see how technology leads to problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical properties of our birth -- the color of our skin or the look on our faces to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, to process data on gender or race, to determine whether we can get a loan.
Everything we see now is just a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now, it's a moment of evolution.
That means what we're doing now, it's going to affect the way things go, and it's going to go into the future world.
If we want artificial intelligence to help humans evolve in a way, we need to define strategies and targets, open that path immediately.
I want to see the direction of human culture and environment.
Technology can help us cure neurotic diseases or other disabilities, making life as challenging as everyone else.
Technology doesn't work on your characteristics or skin color.
Today I'm concerned about technology tomorrow and 10 years later.
Artificial intelligence can appear in many different ways.
But in this case, it's not an unmanned vehicle with no destination.
This is the car that we can control at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose whether we need to turn around.
We choose what artificial intelligence will be in the future.
Allow artificial intelligence to become everything.
It'll turn into a lot of different things.
Now it's up to us to figure out what needs to be done to ensure that artificial intelligence results are better for all humans.
Thank you.

Black land's "plant" out of agricultural modernization - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Society, Harbin, July 26th.
In the summer, two spray planes ran over the 10,000 acres of high-yielding demonstration fields at the second operating station in the fifth management area of the Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the "first day of the world" in the green field, which was grown with black rice.
The station's station chief, Confucius, said that this aircraft can spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land per day, about eight times more efficiently than drones and hundreds of times more artificially.
This farm is located in the friendly county of Heilongjiang Province, our first food-producing province, from the sound of the past rice-cutting to the sound of today's "Lunglong" motor, where traditional Chinese farming and farms are transformed.
In addition to the aircraft, satellites are also used in the modernization of agricultural production on friendly farms.
Confucius explained that, on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing to achieve precision application, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution, and, on the other hand, satellite navigation technology to improve the standard operating level in agricultural and aircraft fields.
During this year ' s rice production, the farm expanded the area of operation of satellite navigation UAV technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes seedlings more evenly planted, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves 16 dollars per acre in labour costs.
In agricultural production, farms attempt new technologies such as informatization, intelligence etc. to form the country ' s largest group of agricultural machinery from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, there are 49,000 farm machinery holdings at present, with an overall field mechanization rate of 99.8 per cent.
Agricultural machine operations achieved 100 per cent GPS satellite navigation, 100 per cent intensive seeding in dry fields and 100 per cent operation in dry field large motor vehicles.
" Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture is the path of agricultural modernization... "
Lord Liu of Friendship Farm says...
The key to agricultural modernization is technological progress.
Farm-based Heilongjiang Farming has in recent years played a leading role in the demonstration of modern large-scale agriculture, leading to the initial establishment of large-scale farming, standardized production, and industrialization as the dominant modern agro-industry system.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there's a 350,000 square metre agricultural machine fair.
There is a concentration of more than 140 farm tools that have been introduced in Heilongjiang for many years.
These agricultural tools and farms have witnessed our agricultural modernization.

Xinhua Society On July 26th, Xinhua Society called: Question: Question of Xinhua Society
Xinhua News Agency journalist Chen Sang-jun, Wang Li Wu, Liu Sha Village
On July 25th, at around 4:00 p.m., Fu Quinbao was in mud-filled rubber shoes, went to the back room, and went back and forth with his wife, Zhou Yin.
"I received a call from the village cadres to transfer, and I was still mowing grass in the field."
Fu Quinbao said he was running over 60 acres of land, growing rice and growing up pretty well, " Yesterday he took his medicine, and his tools were empty. "
Fu Quinbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer in the corner, "No one wants their house to be flooded.
In response to the continued high water pressure and possible heavy rainfall in the lake, the city of Hefty, Anhui Province, is planning to open the Jiangguchi River, where the family is located, on the 26th day of the year.
Chiangguchi is located in Fatsi County, right next to the lake's embankment.
There are thousands of villagers involved in the town of Chishu and Miheu who need to be relocated.
As at 1600 hours on 25th, our fifth-largest freshwater lake lair remained 13.2 metres high, exceeding the guaranteed level of 0.7 meters.
The Fu Quinbao kitchen was clean, with a bowl of pumpkins on the table, eggs and some halogens in the fridge.
"I didn't think we'd move it, but the water at Chiangguchi is fine. "
Zhou Ying said the house is a flat house, and some big things are still missing.
"Put the valuables together, refrigerators, televisions, and the big ones can be placed in the high-lying neighbours or relatives for the time being. "
The village cadre, Wang Quinbao, has a good idea.
Wang is responsible for the relocation of 13 villagers, and one family is informed that each person has a settlement plan.
The nearest settlement to the Fu Quinbaos is a 2-km trip to the Yu Elementary School.
In addition to the big ones, the headaches of Fu Quinbao are more than 1,000 pounds of food and some new furniture.
"The food is ready to be dragged to the relatives ' house and the furniture can't be moved."
The couple agreed to put a stool under the newly purchased bed and raised it about half a metre high.
At 6 p.m., Fu Quinbao started transporting things to relatives in a tricycle, and Zhou Yin continued packing at home.
At around 11 p.m., the couple looked around the house, pulled the switch, and went to the settlement.
"I hope the water returns soon. "
Fu Quinbao said.
On 26 July, at 9:30 a.m., a reporter observed at the Jiangguchi River site that the area was ready to split the flood.
Zhang Jie-Kolin's home team is strong with myo-Xinhua Network.
The sports boy's hot-blooded game show, the sports boy, was officially launched on July 11th on the South Lake Watch.
The team leader, Zhang Jieko, and the sports assistant Lin Mansion are on the same stage, and Lindane and the Quantico are both styled, while the hard core of the Power Puller, like the "Big Things" is on the field, making the show "Fire" more powerful.
At the top of the list, 11 sports boys in the show of power races, as well as viewing the scene, the "strength conflict" on the stage was also noticed.
Among them, the strong conflict came from SuperA sports student Giovanni, who, before the game, openly challenged the Famous man named Xu Shibin, who was supposed to sing a dance show and even say, "Don't cry with the makeup."
A word of silence has given the boys and sports leaders of the field a chill.
And "strength fight" is more like a fairy fight, with the same power as the Great Demon King's Sun Keeki, playing a strong fight.
And their identities are unexpected. Sun Keeki is a gymist, Zhang Xing Dynasty is a retired SWAT soldier, and he won three medals.
At the start of the game, the boys pulled out their little poles quickly, and the protracted confrontation on the big poles made the viewers sweat on them.
In a tense situation, Zhang Jieko, as one of the sports leaders of the Sports Bar Youth movement, is watching the battle seriously.
He's also very careful at the point where he's patiently encouraged the young people who lost the game to help each and every one of the fault points in the remixing process.
And the sports assistant's house is a flower-like attack, and she doesn't hide her appreciation of the young people who are on the line.
It's more admirable to learn that sports teenagers are overstretched in their daily training.
It's also a sport leader who has the style of lindane and a sports leader, one who's the "predictor" and one who's the "Runny Girl" who uses a smile to break the tension.
In addition, Jikwung and Liu Xing, as sports assistants, have made a lot of jokes about sports teenagers.
The fire at the Church of Nantes in France: the parish volunteers admit to arson, regularity and vernacularism - the new Chinese net.
According to external sources, on July 18, the historic site of Nantes in France, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul Cathedral, was badly damaged in a fire and the organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th of local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer in charge of guarding the cathedral had been charged with "burning and destruction".
He admitted he was setting fire in the church.
According to reports, the local prosecutor, Jonas, 39 years old, a parish volunteer from Rwanda, admitted that he had lit three fires in the cathedral at night.
And his lawyer said that the arsonists now regret it.
He entered France a few years ago by way of refuge, was sheltered in the parish of the fire and was admitted to the church.
The prosecution noted that recently, he had tried to update his visa and was in dialogue with the police.
But the church says it still doesn't believe that a very kind and smileful believer who doesn't speak can destroy a church that he loves so much.
On the day of the 18th July fire, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police for questioning and had been released because of the logical problems in his account.
It's the firefighter's rescue on the scene.
On the evening of 25th night, he was summoned again as a result of new evidence obtained by a professional engineer from the Central Police Laboratory in Paris.
This time, the man confessed to his arson.
It has been reported that if convicted of intentional arson destruction, the suspect may face 10 years ' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
It was reported that the fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre ' s and St. Paul ' s Cathedrals, that the organ in the church was completely burned, and that the coloured window behind the organ was badly damaged.
According to the chief architect of the French historical preservation architecture, Brune, it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Global news: U.S. unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries.
On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its permit for the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and to make a specific request that the Consulate General cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States cause serious problems in the relations between China and the United States, and that it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unjustified provocations of the United States and to take counter-measures.
Andrés Borges, Director of the Chinese Research Centre of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States undermined the bridges of understanding between the peoples of China and the United States and put the relations between the two great Powers in crisis.
China informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu would be counterproductive to the unilateral measures taken by the United States and in line with diplomatic practice.
According to Patricio Justo, Professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and Director of the Centre for Central American Studies, the above-mentioned decision of the Chinese side is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure against the previous United States provocation and not against the ordinary American population.
The U.S. tries to divert attention from the U.S. by pressuring China to cover up its weak response to the new crown epidemic.
The Chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Centre of the Indonesian think tank, Bambang Suryono, said that the provocative diplomatic stance of the United States had seriously troubled relations between China and the United States and that relations between the two countries faced serious challenges ...
China ' s notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal counter-measure, consistent with diplomatic practice, and reflects both China ' s principled position of firm defence of its own interests and the legitimate advantages of Chinese diplomacy.
The Tanzanian currentist Francis Semwenza said that China ' s above-mentioned decision was a legitimate and necessary response to the American provocation.
In order to return to normal relations between China and the United States, the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in its internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to win with China economically and politically and for the benefit of both peoples and the international community as a whole ...
Ali Yusuf, Executive Director of the Arab-Chinese Federation of Friendship Associations, based in the Sudan, said that the counter-measures that China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustifiable actions of the American side, in accordance with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practice.
Previously, the United States demanded the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston in grave violation of international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will reverse its previous decisions and create the necessary conditions for the normalization of relations between the two countries.
The Singapore Joint Morning News published an editorial saying that the larger strategic intent of the United States was to block China and prevent it from rising.
In the face of the United States of America, China has been reluctant to see its relations with China deteriorate, but has had to take counter-measures.

The Xinhua Society Guangzhou journalist (journalist Mao) learned from the Guangdong Sea Police that in recent days, the Xinhua Society, in conjunction with Guangzhou Customs, the Public Security Department, had dismantled a huge group of oil-smuggling products, which had been smuggling some 120,000 tons of oil since 2019, worth about 800 million yuan yuan, and had stolen about 240 million yuan in taxes.
The Guangdong Sea Police, in conjunction with the Customs Department, have progressively worked out the division of labour and structure of the group.
On 8 July, the maritime police, the customs and the public security services launched a single collection network operation in Guangzhou, Foshan and the seafront of the Pearl River. Four ships suspected of smuggling were seized on site. The vessels involved and the fuel depots seized a total of 4,700 tons of oil and frozen the accounts of a group of funds.
The joint operation was known to have launched a total of eight ships, two helicopters, and to have been coordinated by several operational teams to strike the entire chain of operations against maritime smuggling, illegal land operations and so on, with the arrival of 35 major suspects.
The case is under further investigation.
The relevant officers of the Guangdong Sea Police said that they would continue to maintain high-pressure postures in the future to combat smuggling and criminal activities at sea and to maintain good order in the maritime areas of their jurisdiction.
Hurricane Hanna landed in Medellus, or caused a flood of rivers and floods-- a new net.
On July 26th, China-News Network reported that, at 5 p.m. local time, Hurricane Hanna landed in Texas, United States of America, causing heavy storms, rising rivers and potentially life-threatening flash floods.
According to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Hanna is expected to carry heavy rains across parts of the southern and north-eastern parts of the state, which may have caused some stream surges and life-threatening flash floods.
According to reports, the worst affected by Hurricane Hanna was the area south of Cops Christy to the mouth of the Grand River, while the Rio Grande Valley could be affected by widespread flash floods.
Governor Abbot of Texas 25 said, "Any hurricane is a great challenge."
Thirty-two counties in the state are in a state of emergency because of the hurricane.
The city of Cops Christy, a city with a population of over 320,000, has closed down its libraries and museums and its inhabitants are waiting.
Abet also said that, while Texas was suffering from a new coronary, it could not be allowed to cause more casualties in Texas.
In Southern Texas, rainfall is reported to reach 6 to 12 inches in the night of 26, and 3 to 5 inches in northern Texas and coastal Louisiana.
Because of global warming and other factors, Hanna was formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
Normally, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually takes place in mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women
The Polish Ministry of Justice indicated on Saturday that next week Poland will take steps to withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women ...
According to the Polish right-wing Government Cabinet, the treaty requires schools to teach students about gender issues, which violates the rights of parents ...
A press conference organized by the Polish Minister of Justice, Djobleo, said that the Ministry of Justice, which he headed, would submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family to begin withdrawing from the Treaty on Monday.
That treaty is called the Istanbul Convention.
Joblow said, "The treaty contains elements of what we believe to be harmful morphological nature."
The Polish law in power has a close alliance with the Justice Party and its governing coalition partners with the Roman Catholic Church to promote a conservative social agenda ...
Polish President Douda made the issue of homophobic rights one of the main topics during the successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, tens of thousands of Poles, mostly women, protested against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
One of the organizers of the protest, Lempatt, in a protest march in Warsaw, said, "The purpose of withdrawal is to legalize domestic violence."
Some protesters carry banners that say, "The Law and Justice Party is the Hell of Women."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland ' s former centrist government ratified the Convention in 2015 ...
The Government of the Party for Law and Justice stated that the treaty did not respect religion and called for the teaching of liberal social policies in schools ...
But to date, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

The results of the Brazilian President's new coronary virus test were reversed - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Society in Brasilia on July 25th, Brazilian President Bossonaro announced on his personal social media account that his latest new coronary virus test was negative.
In addition to publishing the latest test results, Bossonaro posted pictures of his handheld hydrazine box in social media.
Bosonaro has always maintained that the drug is effective in treating the new coronary virus infection and has shown himself on social media live on several occasions.
According to Brazilian media reports, Bosonaro announced the results of the virus test that day and travelled on a motorcycle to the capital, Brasilia, where he also met with a congressman.
Bobonaro had been in isolation at the Presidential residence.
On 7th of this month, Bosonaro announced in a joint broadcast in several local media outlets that he had tested positive for the new coronary virus on 6th and twice on 14 and 21st, with positive results.
Jiangxi opened a green passageway for young people on the flood front.
The recruitment office of the People ' s Government of Jiangxi province, Xinhua Society, on 26 July (Ko Dongming, Kuang) has recently made it clear that individuals or their children, who featured prominently in this flood disaster relief mission, are eligible for recruitment, medical examinations, political examinations are qualified and priority assigned to soldiers.
" After the young recruits have been registered, we will join forces with the young recruits ' communities, the Street Armed Department and the recruitment office in the Xiangyang district to verify that they will be prioritized ... "
According to Wang Fai, Deputy Minister of Man-Wu of Xiyang District, Xijiang City, they have been organizing a medical examination of young recruits for three days since the beginning of the 25-day period affected by the floods.
Xijiang City's young recruits are a 22-year-old university graduate, whose mother is a community worker, whose father is a veteran of an Air Force department, and whose parents have been on the front line to fight against the flood for more than 10 days.
"Those days, when the people saw their sons in the news defending their homeland on the line of fighting against the flood, I wanted to be one of them. "
Chow said he's had an army dream since he was a kid, and through this fight against the flood, he's strengthened his resolve to go to the barracks.
Xijiang City also uses the flood risk as a "living material" for military recruitment campaigns. They are community-based, calling upon young recruits to take part voluntarily in the task of patrolling the Chati, on duty, etc., to recognize the nature of the People's Army and to strengthen their confidence in participating in the military.
Ishigang City's Jinyang District People's Council Committee Kao Yu said that, by giving priority to soldiers, it was hoped that more young recruits would be encouraged and that a good social atmosphere would be created in which to take part in the mission and join the army.
According to Vietnam News Agency, Grivali believes that Viet Nam has contributed significantly to the development of ASEAN over the past 25 years.
Viet Nam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also an ASEAN locomotive.
Grivori stated that Russia and, indeed, the Asia-Europe Economic Union believed that Viet Nam had contributed to the advancement of ASEAN and the promotion of its image to the outside world.
He said, "ASEAN should therefore thank Vietnam."
Grivori stated that the analysts had endorsed the peace initiative put forward by Viet Nam.
Viet Nam is ready to share its experience with ASEAN countries and propose constructive peace measures on the issues facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East China Sea.
With regard to cooperation between Viet Nam and Russia within the ASEAN framework, Grivori believes that Viet Nam supports Russia ' s cooperative relationship with ASEAN to help Russia gain benefits under this cooperation framework.
The Asia-Europe Economic Union, including Russia, and Viet Nam have been able to enter the ASEAN market by signing a free trade agreement ...
Grivori proposes to maximize the free trade area between the Asia-Europe Economic Union and the ASEAN countries, thereby creating a platform for economic and security stability ...
At the same time, Grivali believes that Russia, Viet Nam and ASEAN are on track and will achieve their goals.
From now until the end of 2020, North River Province will have the necessary conditions, particularly in terms of infrastructure, human resources and land, to proactively attract foreign capital flows, especially transnational groups with value chains and the transfer of advanced technology.
In addition, North River Province will be ready to submit to the Prime Minister of the Government his proposal for investment in infrastructure development and business projects in the Vietnamese industrial zone and to approve the addition of two industrial-urban-service zones in the province, Anshan-North and Anjoo, to be included in the document on the master plan for the development of the Viet Nam industrial zone by 2020.
At the same time, North River Province has made efforts to accelerate progress on projects such as infrastructure development and operation projects for industrial park clusters such as Fu, Guangzhou, Twin Creeks and Uttar Pradesh, and to generate land funds for business purposes.
In 2020, the North River Department of Industry and Trade participated in the design of industrial zones, industrial cluster planning and advice to be included in the provincial planning.
North River Province has identified the development of clusters of industrial parks as a combination of national security, ecological protection and food security, thus contributing to balanced industrial development; and the availability of comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water supply, transport and telecommunications, as well as with other social infrastructure such as urban construction, trade services, worker housing and health, education, etc.
In industrial zones, the North River Province has made strong appeals for investment projects in high-tech, clean technologies in such areas as electricity, electronics, telecommunications equipment, precision machinery, ancillary industries.
In industrial parks clusters, the province calls for small- and medium-scale investment projects in production, the use of local labour, especially in agricultural products, food processing, etc.
In the future, North River Province will focus on accelerating investment in the infrastructure of the North River logistics centre, in tandem with the industrial park cluster, in order to optimize goods, currency flows and help reduce production costs, improve the value of goods, optimize supply chains and develop multimodal transport, thereby creating an incentive for investors to invest in the province.
Upgraded Russian helicopter gun card-52M for the first time out of the factory at the end of the year - Xinhuanet
According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defence, an upgraded version of the Russian helicopter gunship (hereinafter " Wuzheng " ) card-52 -- K-52M will be the first to be converted and out of the plant in December this year and will be significantly upgraded in terms of surveillance, communications and weapons performance.
According to a recent Russian newspaper, Wuzhika-52M, known as "Super Short-Croats", was developed under a contract signed last April between the Russian military and military engineering units, and the first two upgrades are currently being converted to the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian Progressive Aerospace Group, whose national testing and completion will be completed by October 2022.
According to the Russian expert who was aware of the upgrade, "Supreme Alligator" -- Wuzhika-52 was officially installed in November 2011 and the model exposed a number of weaknesses in its use, and this upgrade was designed to fill the board.
It was reported that, compared to K-52, K-52M would partially introduce new types of protective materials that would not add weight, and its pilot cabin would be reinforced with new equipment to withstand missile attacks, thus increasing the probability of survival in the field; larger generators would be equipped to power more sophisticated on-board electronic equipment; photovoltaic systems upgraded to detect and identify distant battlefield targets; new light-use multi-purpose missiles, with a range of up to 20 kilometres and a range of approximately one times higher than the range of similar missiles used in active Russian martial arts, would be equipped with defensive weapons and communications equipment that would maximize their utility to the Mi-28NM helicopter, which could attack air targets, thus making related maintenance simpler and economical.
In addition, card-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems and navigation equipment.
The Russian expert also expressed concern that K-52M would be equipped with communications equipment to communicate with drones, thereby providing real-time access to information transmitted by nearby drones in the air, such as the images taken by drones on the helicopter ' s cabin screen.
As planned, the K-52M pilots are able to directly manipulate the drones with which they work, thereby improving the pilots ' knowledge of the battlefield situation and their guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Minister of Defence Krivorucciko said in December last year that the Russian Ministry of Defence planned to purchase more than 110 martial arts cards and 52M by 2027.
According to the new decree, the Campania district must wear a mask in public indoors from the very beginning, with a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
On June 1, local time, Rome, the Italian capital, the Roman Ordnance Field was reopened.
According to reports, according to the latest quarantine decree issued by the Regional Government, the people of the Campania region are required to wear masks in accordance with the quarantine requirements in all public transport, as well as in all indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets and galleries.
Violation of this provision is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
At the same time, the decree provides for the segregation of all passengers from non-Schengen countries entering the Campania region.
The regional government will authorize the health agencies to coordinate the organization of specific hotels for the isolation of the positive non-symptoms.
The decree entered into force on 25 July.
In less than an hour, three customers who entered the supermarket received a fine.
1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological rehydration of the river ' s lake since this year in Hebei - Central New Network
Xinhua Society, Ishijia, 26 July, journalist Wang Qun, learned from the Hebei Province Water Department that, since this year, Hebei Province has implemented eco-rehydration using the water from the rivers and the local reservoirs, and has made a total of 1.75 billion cubic metres of eco-rehydration from the rivers and white sediments such as the Ma River.
Hebei Province has seized the advantage of increasing the flow of water through the North-South Water Central Line project, using rivers such as the Tang River, the Sand River and the Dragon River to carry out ecological water recharges.
At the same time, using the Western Ocean, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs, including East Wusheng, and the Shaoyang River, rivers, such as the Blue Dragon River, have implemented ecological water recharges that have accumulated over 90 square kilometres of water.
In order to perform ecological water recharge efforts, the Hebei Department of Water Affairs actively organizes the detection of riverine hazards, the remediation of the reinforcement and cleaning of the riverways, the refinement of physical measures, and the strengthening of surveillance and surveillance services.
The timely resolution of problems through supervised inspections and intensive unannounced visits ensured the safe and orderly recharge of rivers.
According to the head of the Hebei Department Water Department, the orderly implementation of river lake eco-rehydration has effectively rehabilitated the water environment of Hebei Province and has contributed to the restoration and preservation of the coastal groundwater and has greatly improved the habitat and economic development environment along the border, and is important for the conservation of the clean water, green shore, smooth river and beautiful river lake management.
You all should know what I'm talking about.
I think the intuition that inequality can cause social division and corruption predates the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the effects of inequality by comparing societies with societies with different degrees of equality.
I'll show you some data and explain why those data are relevant.
But first, let's see how hard our lives are.
I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This graph shows the relationship between our average life expectancy and our gross national income (GNI) -- the latter measure the average wealth of a country.
You can look at those countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, which are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal and the other countries on the left.
But that doesn't affect the life expectancy of their nationals.
There's no evidence of interconnection.
But if we get to know the inside of society, we can see that there are great differences in health conditions within their societies as a whole.
This map still shows life expectancy.
These are the towns of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There's a big difference between the poor and the others.
Even those at the top, whose health is worse than those at the top.
So income means very much in our society, but comparisons between societies make no sense.
The paradox is that, in our society, we look at relative income or social status, identity -- the interrelationship between us and the size of the gap between people.
Once you have that idea, you should immediately think, "What happens if the gap widens? What happens if the gap narrows? What happens if the income gap widens or reduces it?"
That's what I'm about to tell you.
I didn't use any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations -- like the World Bank -- on the income gap between these rich, developed markets and democratic countries.
The way we use it, it's easy to understand, and you can download it, is to compare the income gap between the previous 20% and the subsequent 20% in each country.
You can see that the countries on the left are more equal -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- and their previous 20 percent wealth is about 3.5 to 4 times the later 20 percent.
But on the other side of the inequality -- Britain, Portugal, the United States, Singapore -- the income gap is double that.
In this comparison, our country is twice as unequal as other equally successful democratic markets.
And then I'll show you what it does to our society.
We've collected data on problems arising from intra-social differences, problems that are more common at the bottom of the society.
Internationally comparable data include life expectancy, children's mathematics and language performance, infant mortality, suicide rates, prison population, teenage pregnancy rates, levels of mutual trust, obesity, mental illness - all of which meet standard diagnostic classifications, including drug and alcohol addiction - and social mobility rates.
We put all of this in a factor.
They're all weighted on average.
The score for a country is the average of these factors.
As you can see, these scores are more relevant to the inequality I've just shown, and I'll show them over and over again.
The more unequal the country is, the worse it is on social issues.
It's very relevant.
But if you look at the same health and social issues compared to the per capita national income and the GNI index, you'll find nothing, no relevance.
We're a little worried that people might think that we'd pick specific questions to suit our theories and then create artificial evidence, so we also published a paper on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index in the British Journal of Medicine.
It contains 40 different parts, from other people's summaries.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether they have books in their homes, how many immunization rates they have, and whether there are bullying in schools.
It's all covered.
That's how the index is related to the same degree of inequality.
The more unequal a society, the worse a child behaves.
Relationships and their visibility.
But once again, if you look at child welfare as it relates to per capita national income, you'll get nothing.
All the data I'm showing you right now reveal the same thing.
The average welfare of our society is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They're very important in poorer countries, but not in rich developed countries.
And the difference between us and our position vis-à-vis others seems very important today.
I'm going to show you some of the sections of our index.
It's a mutual trust index.
It means the proportion of people who agree that most people are credible.
This is from the World Values Survey.
As you can see, on the more unequal side, about 15% of people feel they can trust others.
But in a more equal society, that percentage rises to 60% or 65%.
If you look at community participation or social capital assessment, there's a very similar correlation with inequality.
I'd say we've repeated the job twice.
For the first time, these rich and developed countries, we changed the subject of the test, and this test was repeated to 50 states in the United States -- the same question: Are the more unequal states, the worse in all these assessments?
This is the relationship between trust and inequality that the federal government has created in a general social survey.
Very similar dispersions in similar levels of trust.
The same thing goes on.
Basically, we found that almost all the factors related to mutual trust reflected in the international investigation are also reflected in the 50 states we've investigated separately.
It's not a coincidence.
This is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization uses random sampling to collect data using the same diagnostic interviews that allow us to compare the rates of mental illness in every society.
It's the percentage of the population with any kind of mental illness in the previous year.
It's ranged from 8% to more than 24% -- which suggests that the proportion of mental illness in society as a whole is three times higher than in other societies.
Similarly, these are closely linked to inequality.
This is the crime rate.
The red dots represent the states of the United States, the blue triangle means the provinces of Canada.
But look at their numbers.
Murder rates ranged from 1 5 to 150 per million.
It's the ratio of prison inmates.
This is a 10-fold gap, and the index function magnifies the difference.
But the range of incarcerations varies from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain some of the reasons.
But more severe trials, or harsher trials.
The more unequal society is, the more likely it is to retain the death penalty.
This is a picture of children dropping out of high school.
Again, there's a big gap.
If we talk about the selection of people in society, we'll find that this gap is very damaging.
This is the social mobility rate.
It's actually based on the income flow rate.
Basically, what it's asking is: does rich fathers have rich children, poor fathers have poor children, or is there nothing between them?
On the more unequal side, Dad's income is more important -- for example, England, the United States.
And in Northern Europe, Dad's income is less important.
There's more social mobility there.
As we used to say -- I know there's a lot of American listeners here -- if Americans want to realize their American dream, they should go to Denmark.
I've already shown it here in italics.
I can show you some other questions.
Those problems are more prevalent at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with the social gradient, which are worse in unequal countries -- not just a little bit bad, but two times 10 times worse than anything else.
Think about the cost, the cost of manpower.
I'd like to go back to this map we've shown before, and we'll put it all together to show two things.
First, by way of a copy of the chart, we found that the less performing countries, whatever they were, seemed to be the more unequal countries, but the better performers seemed to be the Nordics and the Japanese.
So what we see is the relationship between widespread social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things went wrong, but almost everything.
Another very important point I'd like to point out on this chart is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show in every way that they're very different countries.
The status of women, their commitment to small families, in rich and developed countries, is at two extremes.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has a big difference in income, but it narrows the gap with taxes, state benefits, generous relief, etc.
Japan is quite different.
First of all, the pre-tax wage gap is smaller in Japan.
It's less taxed.
It's also less well-being.
And in the study of the states of the United States, we found a stark contrast.
There are states that perform well through redistribution, and there are states that do well because of the low income gap before taxes.
So we've come to the conclusion that it's not important to achieve greater equality, it's important to achieve it.
I'm not talking about full equality, I'm talking about democracy in rich and developed markets.
Another unexpected thing about this map is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.
There seems to be a point in the words of John Dorne: "No one is an island... "
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behaviour of every social class in different countries with more or less equality.
That's just one example.
This is the infant mortality rate.
According to the general socio-economic classification of England, some Swedes have been very kind enough to classify a lot of infant deaths.
It's an anachronistic classification based on paternity, so single mothers make their own data sets.
But we're looking at the so-called "low class of society," which is a hand job without skills.
In the middle is the need for skilled manual work, and up to the top level of non-manual work, up to the level of professional work -- doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
This shows that Sweden is doing better than England, and it's doing better at every level of society.
The biggest difference is at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We've shown five different sets of data, including American and international educational outcomes and health.
It seems that overall -- a more equal society displays the most obvious differences at the bottom of society, but there are also some advantages at the upper levels of society.
I should explain what's going on.
I think I'm showing and discussing the psychological impact of inequality on society.
More concerned with superiority and inferiority, valued and despised, respected and devalued.
Of course, the feelings that arise as a result of the competitive position of identity have driven social consumerism forward.
But it also leads to indeterminate status.
What worries us more is how others judge and view us, whether we seem attractive, smart, or something like that.
Social value evaluation increases the fear of evaluating these social values.
Interestingly, some similar work in the field of sociopsychology is also going on: some people have looked at 208 different studies; in the study, volunteers are invited to a psychological testing centre and then test their stress hormones and their reactions to stress missions.
In this observation, scientists are interested in what kind of pressure is most likely to raise the level of cortex alcohol in the body, the most important of which is Hormon.
The result is precisely those tasks that include social assessment of threats -- those that threaten self-esteem and social status -- in which others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These stressors have a very special effect on stress physiology.
So far we've been criticized.
Of course, some people don't like it, and some people find it surprising.
But I should still tell you that when people criticize us for picking data, we never do that.
We have an unconditional rule that if our data source contains data from the countries being observed, then we'll include it in the analysis.
Our data source determines whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise, there's a deviation.
What about the rest of the world?
In academic peer-reviewed journals, there are 200 studies on the relationship between health and income and equality.
It's not limited to these countries, hiding a simple proof.
Same countries, same inequality measurements, one after the other.
Why don't we control the other factors?
I've shown you that per capita national income has not had any impact.
Of course, there are others who apply more sophisticated methods in the literature that exclude poverty, education, etc. in experiments.
How's the causality?
Relevance does not in itself prove causality.
It took us quite a while.
Indeed, there is a good understanding of the causal link between our results.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in rich and developed countries is how important long-term pressure from society is for immunity and cardiovascular systems.
Or, for example, the reason that violence is becoming more common in more unequal countries is because people are very sensitive to being despised.
I'd say, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of post-tax and pre-tax problems.
We should limit income, curb the top income culture.
I think we have to do everything we can to make our leaders accountable to our employees.
The last thing I want to conclude is that we can improve our true quality of life by reducing our income gaps.
In that case, we'll find out that suddenly we've solved the psychosocial problems of society as a whole, and that's great.
Thank you.

In the last two weeks, Spain has seen a sharp rise in the number of new confirmed cases, with thousands of new cases occurring in several days.
On the evening of Saturday (25 July), the British Government provisionally decided to remove Spain from the safe travel list starting at 0000 hours local time on 26 July, and that those who entered the United Kingdom from Spain must be separated for 14 days.
British tourists on vacation in Spain were surprised, worried, and even angry at the decision, because the news came as unexpectedly as it was.
According to reports, British traffic minister Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain.
Prior to the British quarantine measures, Norway had also announced a 10-day quarantine for those returning from Spain.
France and Belgium advised their residents to abandon their plans for vacation in Barcelona and the surrounding area.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded and social distances between people cannot be maintained, and the police once needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is an important pillar of Spain.
Spain: This is safe.
In response to the British decision, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Sunday that the epidemic was under control.
The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Arancha González Laya, stressed to the press: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government is trying to convince the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the rate of infection in these two tourist resorts is much lower than in the UK.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Catalan region of Spain has also re-opened the restraining order.
Tourism is an important pillar of Spain, which is one of the most popular resorts for British tourists.
This decision by the United Kingdom is expected to have a major impact on the tourism industry in Spain.

July 26th of Xinhua's Xinhua society called July 26th, the first day of the year.
In the early morning of 26th, the storm was stormy, dissipating the heat and heat that had beset the Beijing area for days, and the new rain would continue for days.
According to the Beijing Meteorological Station at 1100 hours on 26th, there was a scattered shower in Beijing (with weak lightning), with a maximum temperature of only 27°C per day; at night, there was a small rain (with weak lightning), with a minimum temperature of 23°C.
And from 24 to 25 years ago, the city of Beijing was in high temperature blue warning, with the highest daily temperatures in most areas at around 37°C, with temperatures exceeding 40°C.
The weather is the highest temperature in a year, the damp, the hot, the "thirty" in a year, the hottest in the middle.
When we got into the ambush, the house was full of barns, and there was a popular word about a dumpling.
According to the current forecast, the weather in Beijing will be dark for the next three days.
The weather department alerts the public to minimize mountain play and to guard against geological disasters.
It's known that this year's midlife is 20 days, starting on 26 July and ending on 14 August.
When you're in the middle, you'll feel weak and hungry.
The choice of green beans in the diet, food with heat and abstinence, as well as bitter foods such as cucumbers and cucumbers, can help increase appetite and eliminate the heat.
The engine may be out. FAA has an emergency order to check 2,000 Boeing passenger aircraft - Xinhuanet.
The United States Federal Aviation Office (FAA) issued an emergency seaworthiness directive on 24 February, requesting an emergency inspection of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737 NG and 737 Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, which could result from the erosion of the air-retrieval valves of the passenger aircraft in question.
According to the Federal Aviation Office, four air parking reports for passenger engines 737 NG and 737 Classic have been received to date, resulting in urgent inspection requests for passenger aircraft that have been parked for seven consecutive days or more and for passenger aircraft that have thus far flown less than 11 times after re-entry.
The Federal Aviation Agency warns that if all two passenger engines are corroded, the level 5 valves may be stuck in open positions, causing the plane to lose all power and to be unable to re-invigorate the motive.
This aviation regulatory authority has ordered that, once the repercussion valves are found to be corrosion, the air operator must replace this critical component before the passenger aircraft is re-used.
Boeing responded later in the day that the outbreak of the new crown had led to lower demand for travel, which had resulted in a number of passenger aircraft being blocked or used less, " returning valves are more vulnerable to corrosion " .
Boeing also stated that it had been recommended that air operators inspect passenger aircraft covered by the directive and that, if problems were identified, Boeing would provide assistance in such areas as repair and replacement of return valves.
The Associated Press reported that passenger aircraft flying under the flag of the major air operators in the United States usually fly several times in one day, but after the outbreak of the new crown, a large number of passenger aircraft were grounded; as the demand for passengers had grown slowly in recent times, some aircraft were re-opened.
The FAA didn't issue any details on the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines revealed one of these incidents later on the 24th.
In its statement, the air operator stated that a passenger aircraft under the flag had suddenly turned off a fire while travelling from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on 15 July, and that it had finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines states that the engines of the passenger aircraft have been replaced and that the engines of the six passenger aircraft have been checked in accordance with the Federal Aviation Office ' s instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Air, respectively, said that there had been no engine shutdowns associated with air stop valves on the passenger aircraft under the flag.
Four American Airlines passenger planes will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines will be inspected.
Dharma Air said it's going to check 20 passenger planes under the flag, but it doesn't indicate whether the engine went out.
There are many media reports that the FAA emergency airworthiness directive is another shock to Boeing.
A Boeing 737 MAX passenger aircraft of Indonesian Lions and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing 346 people.
This series of passenger aircraft was subsequently grounded worldwide, stopped in January this year and resumed production in May.
In June, Federal Aviation Director Steve Dixon admitted that the Federal Aviation Authority had made a mistake in regulating Boeing on the 737 MAX passenger plane.
"Ding-ding-ding! Hello teacher." Next week.
There's a new art online.
The interactive knowledge-sharing show "Ting Bang On the Line!" will be aired on the Hunan Watch from July 20.
It is understood that the program will create a new age-old class, with a group of talented and talented teachers coming forward to challenge the production of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the serious impressions of the past group of teachers in the general public, "Tinging on the line! Good teacher" gathers together a group of intellectual representatives of face and talent.
They're both youth role models from all disciplines, and they're a bunch of enthusiasts who can shake their loads and learn to be happy.
In the show, these excellent youth knowledge role models, as "knowledge sharing officers", will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to show the most interesting aspects of their discipline through an attitude of knowledge to impress the audience.
And the whole-age viewer's "Advocacy" scene raises questions, makes it harder for the "knowledge-sharing officer" to teach, and adds some excitement to the show.
It has been revealed that among the "knowledge-sharing officers" are excellent young teachers such as Lee Young Lok, a secondary school physics teacher attached to the People's University of China, Zhang Shei Feng, a leading professor of science, and Wang Jing, a history teacher with 10 years of experience, who will show their field viewers their knowledge of the "hard core" of various disciplines in unexpected ways.
In addition, Professor Xue Mu Fong was invited as the "Knowledge Launcher" of the show to join the "Tinging Assistant" To Haitao and Kyonyo to talk to the audience about youth and to build the "Open Youth for All" class.
Chief Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: The situation is critical.
Xinhua Society Hong Kong on July 26, the Chief Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Jianzhong Zhang, stated that the situation of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be critical and that, if the epidemic breaks down, the HKSAR Government will decisively take more stringent controls to further restrict the operation of the premises and reduce the number of spaces available to the public.
At this stage, however, the HKSAR government has no intention of imposing a "home order" or "restraint order" to restrict citizens from leaving the country.
Zhang Jianjong published a website entitled "The situation is critical and the disease is being combated."
He said that the epidemic was the worst in six months and that the next two weeks would be critical in trying to prevent the virus from spreading further in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the HKSAR Government, self-regulation and cooperation by the citizens are also important.
He called on the public to stay home as much as possible, to reduce social contact and to go out to eat.
Citizens should cooperate with the coercive measures of wearing masks to protect themselves and others, and focus on personal and environmental health and manual hand washing, and, above all, suspend non-essential family and friends meetings or dinners and reduce them to the streets.
He stated that the Central Government has been very interested in the evolution of the epidemic in Hong Kong and has supported the HKSAR Government in its efforts to combat the epidemic, and has responded positively to the latest request of the Chief Executive to assist in increasing detection capabilities and adapting the International Expo in Asia to provide assistance for similar work as the "Fair Hospital".
According to Zhang Jianjong, the free virus testing provided by the HKSAR Government to specific high-risk groups, i.e. residential homes, homes with disabilities and nursing homes, restaurants, taxi drivers and property managers, has been fully implemented, involving up to 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about cases of infection in residential homes, where the Government had arranged specific temporary quarantine centres.
He indicated that the HKSAR Government was building quarantine facilities near the Bamboo Bay quarantine centre on the New Territories Hill, and that it was expected to provide an additional 700 quarantine units by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on 19 that the HKSAR Government would build an additional 2,000 quarantine houses at the Bamboo Bay Quarantine Centre, with the aim of completing them by the end of this year.
With 800 of the quarantine centres already operational, the Bamboo Bay quarantine centres are expected to provide a total of 3,500 isolation rooms by the end of the year.
There are currently four operating quarantine centres in Hong Kong, providing approximately 2,600 isolation units.
In addition, on 24th, the HKSAR Government reopened the Carpgate Park Resort on Hong Kong Island as a community isolation facility for patients under the age of 50 who are self-sufficient.
It's the history of the P.O. Party, the Nutrient in the history of New China.
Source: People's Forum Network.
In recent days, Secretary-General Xi Jinping, during his visit to the Quartet memorial, stressed that " 1.4 billion people, more than 90 million members of the party, especially at all levels of leadership, will learn well from the history of the Communist Party of China, the history of the New China...

"Change Gangnam" after the poem "Hang River Dream" - the new Chinese net.
"Sihang Jiangnan" is after the poem "Hang River Dream"
Sino-Cong Cong-Chu's call of July 26th, "Nix Yellow River Van Lissa, the wind of the world."
The Yellow River, which inspires so many humans, gives birth to a beautiful and rich plain of Ningxia, and now, Ningxia, who has the beautiful name "Seong Gangnam", insists on the concept of "eco-priority, green development" and pursues the poetic "Yang River Dream".
"Bippo Dreams" by the Qing Shui Show.
"The Yellow River of Funingxia", which runs 397 kilometers through Ningxia, is the Mother's River that raised one side.
But with industrialization, rapid progress in urbanization, river lake exploitation and management to protect imbalances, super-marked discharges, cropping around lakes, appropriation of waters, etc., all of which are highlighted, the water bodies are black and stench, the water quality is excessive, the environment is dirty and the environment is degraded.
Now Ningxia is pushing for the restoration of the diversity of the water, trying to return the Yellow River to Qing.
The water has to start from the source.
In Ningxia Silvergawa, where sewage from industrial parks is fully treated in a centralized manner, municipal sewage treatment plants are fully discharged at the level A standard, cities are built into black and stinky bodies are largely eliminated, and the third batch of Chinese black and stinky water demonstration cities are declared successful.
In addition, Ningxia ' s full implementation of the river lake length system in 2017 has now achieved full coverage of the district and district village level 5 river lake length liability system, which has become the norm.
He lived in a village by the Yellow River when he was 64 years old, and he saw a change in the Yellow River: "The previous water stinks, and after it's been fixed, it doesn't smell anymore."
Gu said that the environment was better and his life easier, and now he goes for a walk with his family on the Yellow River and feels the blue sky.
"The Dream of the Wetlands" by the Sandgulls.
Flying birds, green trees, stairwells, water... the beauty of Fan under the sand gulls has become a reality in the Yellow River Wet Park in Ningxia Silver River.
Through Ningxia, yellow rivers form various wetlands, such as river, lake and swamp wetlands, which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water, and which also serve as important international migration routes for birds.
Since 2009, the Ningxia-related sector has accumulated funding for wetland conservation projects in the order of RMB 3450 million. Currently, there are 19.2 million hectares of Sinakawa wetlands, 78.5 per cent of them protected, there are natural lakes, nearly 200 marsh wetlands, five national wetlands parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous wetlands parks and eight municipal parks.
Lu Jinyu, Deputy Director of the Swat River City wetland conservation centre, told reporters that wetland conservation has increased biodiversity, particularly in birds, "The gulls are a endangered bird, with over 20,000 birds in the world, of which more than 2,000 are sheltered in the Shinchuan wetlands."
At the same time, Ningxia has legally drawn a red line between 500 metres of wetland protection areas in the Yellow Shirts sector, stipulating that no unit or individual may develop or operate within protected areas except for public benefit projects ...
Chiu Shau Yong, Deputy Director General of the Water Service Centre in Silver River City, introduced the integrated management of river lake ecology and end-of-end wetland construction through pollution source management, which now reaches 100 per cent of class IV water quality in the nine main yellow drains in Ningxia." Now the water is clean, fish swim and flowers open.
The "drinking water dream" for all of us.
Ningxia Silvergawa used to have an awkward title: the only city in the Yellow City where the Yellow River is waterless.
From 2010 onwards, the city began to face persistent water shortages during its summer peaks, and the "water shortage pain" of almost 10 years has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents, but is at the limit of overexploitation in the major water sources, which have created large areas of underground groundwater overcrowding areas, and water scarcity has become a problem for the city.
As a result of improved yellow river water quality, the use of purified yellow river water has become a solution to the drinking problems of the local population.
Ding Ming, Deputy Director General of the Water Authority of Silver River City, explained that in order to improve the production of water for urban and rural residents of Silvergawa, Ningxia had in due course launched a water supply project along the rural and urban west lines of the Silvergawa Metropolitan Circle to replace existing groundwater sources with high-quality yellow water.
" On 29 December 2019, the water supply project officially brought water to the third district of the city of Shinchuan, and in 2020, the inhabitants of Guanning Town, Höran County, drank yellow river water ... "
Dingming said that the Silver River Water Sector would take an integrated approach to regional rural water and urban water supply integration, and that next step would be to integrate rural and decentralized water points into the West Line, with the expectation that by the end of this year, rural-urban integrated water supply would be largely achieved ... "
• Strengthening disaster prevention and response in all sectors — the new Chinese network
Increased preparedness of departments to respond to disasters
Newsline: News from the Ministry of Water, today (25 July), at 1200 hours, at 0.64-3.31 metres, the river under the King Huai River dam, at 0.05-2.02 metres, the river under the south and south of the Yangtze River, and the river under the south and south of the river.
Tai Lok has been in existence for 28 days since June 28th.
Today at 1200 hours, the average level of the Lake is 4.67 metres, and it's overstretched to 0.02 metres.
Today, the National Congress of Defence agreed to continue to maintain the Yangtze River and the Huai River Level II response, demanding that local responsibilities be put into place and that disaster relief efforts be further implemented.
Today, the National Defence Agency, the Department of Emergency Management and Emergency Management are urgently deploying a professional flood truck from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve problems such as the flooding in the city caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the U.S. launched a countervailing investigation into China at the RMB.
In response to a recent announcement by the United States Department of Commerce, it was decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation into products originating in China and an investigation into the "undervalued currency exchange rate" project.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce has stated that this is the first time that the United States has investigated the so-called "undervalued currency exchange rate" project in a countervailing case.
In particular, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a press release in this regard on the evening of 23 March, stating that China uses market supply and demand as a basis for regulating a basket of currencies, has a managed floating exchange rate system and the market plays a decisive role in exchange rate formation.
The press release stressed that, overall, the RMB exchange rate was at a reasonably balanced level and was not underestimated.
Since 2005, the renminbi has accumulated an appreciation of more than 17% against the United States dollar.
According to data published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), between the beginning of 2005 and May 2020, the effective exchange rate of the renminbi rose by 38 per cent, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49 per cent, the strongest currency in the G20 economies and one of the most appreciated currencies globally.
According to the Ministry of Commerce, exchange rate issues are beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
In February of this year, the United States amended its legislation to conduct countervailing investigations into foreign exchange rates, which were suspected of violating WTO rules and were subject to multiple objections.
According to the press release, even under United States regulations, the applicant ' s claims are subject to numerous errors, lack of financial support, grant-of-benefit and proprietary countervailing elements ...
China urges the United States to comply with existing international rules and to stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervalued currency exchange rate".
The rise in tensions between China and the United States was further affected by the offshore erosion of the offshore renminbi against the United States dollar for a period of 22 days and the double drop of the dollar against the 7.0 yuan.
Whether the US Department of Commerce is trying to push up the renminbi is a matter of concern.
The renminbi went up to 7.0 on the 23rd day against the dollar, at 6.9961.
Officially controlled median exchange rate of the renminbi against the United States dollar, 17 basis points down on 24, reported at 6.9938.

Family Lewis: John Lewis is a soldier fighting for the weakest.
U.S. Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights fighter, was remembered as a soldier at a memorial service for him on Saturday, July 25.
Lewis' public memorial service has been in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorials on the first day.
At a public memorial service at the University of Troy, Alabama, Saturday, Lewis' five brothers and sisters and a grandson spoke of him as a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
Henry "Grand" Lewis, Lewis' youngest brother, said at the meeting, "He's dedicated his life to helping people."
Samuel Lewis said that his mother had warned John "Don't get in trouble, don't get in trouble."
He added that John didn't listen to his mother's warning, and he said, "We all know that John always gets in trouble, he always gets in trouble, but that's because he insists on the right thing, and that's a good trouble."
Lewis' brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial that John's most famous argument was to create "good troubles", that is, to do justice, not to provoke things.
John applied for the University of Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, and then the University of Troy, which was all white schools, refused his application for admission.
As a child, John Lewis, who preached the Gospel on his farm, was awarded a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, the University of Troy awarded Dr. Lewis an honorary degree.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters "are protesting peacefully and in a nonviolent manner" as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said, "Even if President Trump knocked over a ship and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal nation ... "
A six-day series of events in honour of Lewis will culminate this week at the funeral in Georgia.
The casket of Lewis was parked on Saturday at a public memorial at the University of Troy, where people came to pay tribute to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
In 1965, he and the black protesters who demanded the right to vote were beaten in front of the bridge by the Alabama police, who also gave tear gas to the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed.
This day will be known as Bloody Sunday.
The remains of Lewis will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and finish this last journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require public participation in the event to wear masks and maintain social distance.
The governor of Alabama, Kay Ivey, ordered a half-flag to be lowered on Saturdays and Sundays in honour of Lewis.
In the commemoration of the week or so, Lewis' remains will be divided into the Alabama State Council Building in Montgomery, the Georgia State Council Building in Atlanta, and the United States Congress Building in Washington, D.C., for the public to pay tribute.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and Mitch McConnell, leader of the Senate Majority Party, announced last week that people could come to the House of the United States Congress on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
As a result of the coronary virus epidemic, a public event in honour of Lewis will take place outside the house.

The insistence on party-led leadership and the integration of party leadership into all spheres of grass-roots governance is a fundamental requirement for good governance at the grass-roots level.
To raise the level of governance at the grass-roots level and to insist on party leadership, by strengthening political leadership, building forts of battle, uniting red forces, promoting the party ' s political superiority, organizing advantage and the strength of mass work into governance, and passing party power and advocacy to the end of nerves, the last kilometer.
Focus on the calcium cast, strengthen political leadership.
Political leadership to strengthen grass-roots governance will have to be done with the calcium cast.
It is important to learn from the socialist ideas of Chinese identity in the new era of Xi Jinping as a matter of priority, to make "Remember your mind, remember your mission" the permanent theme of the party's construction and its members, the lifelong subject of its cadres, to strengthen the principle of original studies, and to promote the party's innovative theory through special training, individual training sessions, discussion sessions, lecture halls, etc., in order to ensure that the party's staff is armed and motivated, and to promote the "four consciousness" and "four self-confidence" among its cadres.
Through a combination of online and under-line learning, learning channels have been expanded to guide grass-roots party organizations and party cadres to genuinely integrate learning into their daily lives.
Focusing on practical exercise, in addressing the difficult issues of grass-roots governance, focusing on the concerns of the population, resolving them well, strategizing party nature and abilities.
Get the rules up, build the forts.
Grass-roots party organizations are both an important part of the grass-roots governance system and an important vehicle for governance capacity.
To promote the institutionalization of grass-roots party organizations, starting with the rules governing the work of the party's branches, focusing on the weakening of party leadership, the collapse of the organization, the promotion of development through the creation of mechanisms for networking, the creation of innovative branches, the normalization of weak and weak structures, the establishment of sound decision-making mechanisms, the provision of services to the population, etc.
In rural areas, strengthening the standardization of the organization of village parties, standardizing building standards against party branches, regulating the form of organization, learning activities, management mechanisms, practical promotion of systems such as three sessions, theme party days, etc.
In cities, focus on street communities, explore the form of innovative branches, focus on weak areas, "crowds" and "pain spots", actively build a coalition of city parties to achieve effective coverage of the party ' s work.
At the same time, the establishment of institutional mechanisms for good governance at the grass-roots level, the development of joint efforts, the conduct of joint work, the conduct of joint negotiations, the conduct of joint business, the difficulty of working together, the organization of decision-making mechanisms led by grass-roots parties, the improvement of mechanisms for connecting party cadres to serve the masses, the gathering of people in the service of the people, the enhancement of the members ' sense of access, happiness, honour, pride, and the warmth of grass-roots governance.
Play the vanguard, gather the red force.
Basic party cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
Strengthening grass-roots governance, focusing on the governance of grass-roots party cadres, on the role of Red Cells as a model leader in grass-roots governance, and on bringing red forces together at the forefront of reaching out to the public.
To promote governance as a mandatory subject for members of the party at the grass-roots level, to continue to strengthen their intellectual skills, professional training and practical exercise, to develop their spirit of responsibility in their positions of responsibility and to contribute to the development of the foundations for the modernization of the State ' s governance system and its capacity to govern.
The "community whistle-blowing, party membership reporting" campaign should be widely conducted, involving members of the party in community building, management and services, including through participation in party day events, outreach to people in need, identification of services, recognition of modest intentions, and provision of reasonable advice.
The full exercise of the role of non-members in rural areas should lead to the active involvement of the grass-roots parties in the fight against poverty, the ecological construction, the maintenance of trust, the suppression of burns, and the better integration of the red force in the service of the people, including through the creation of a pioneer post for non-members and the formation of a task force for non-members.
The ground-based solidity building.
Grassroots Party is the foundation of the ruling building.
It is only by insisting on close group relations and increasing the well-being of the people, and using party leadership as a fundamental way to promote innovative grass-roots governance, that the foundation be built so that grass-roots party organizations can be pulled out and able to rise up, grass-roots party cadres can rush up, grass-roots governance has a spirit, order, strength and effectiveness.

Coco Sicily's antelope is back in season-Xinhuanet.
Xinning Xining Xining, Xinhua Society, on 25 July, journalist Wang Jin-jin, was informed by the Yangtze National Parks Administration station at Coco Sicily, Changjiang Park District, that monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelope who had previously travelled to the Cheonan Lake region in Coco Sicily was ending their labour and began to return to their homes with young children.
Surveillance footage near the five beam protection station shows that on 25 July, about 40 female hide-and-seeds led by three hide-and-go-go-go-go-go-go-babys continued to pass 3002 km across the Blue Hide Road, five of the Blue Hide Railway's Liangbei Bridge, and the Tibetan take-back has begun.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of hide-and-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-
The Deputy Researcher at the North-West Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences added: "In the early stages of the relocation, Tibetan antelopes face a higher risk of being arrested, so that the number of cubs in the flock is smaller and may even be absent. "
According to the Kusili Administration of the Yangtze National Parks Administration, the number of re-locations of Tibetan antelopes has been on the rise on the whole year after year, with 4860 in 2019, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Even the new words: "It is expected that this year ' s return of the herds will be completed by the beginning of September, and the number of herds is expected to continue to increase."
Tibetan antelopes are protected animals at the national level.
At the end of May of each year, Tibetan antelopes from the Qinghai tri River, Tibet Pond, Xinjiang Algin Hills, etc. are going to produce lambs in Lake Djone, in the heart of Coco Sicily.
Our Tibetan antelope protection expert, Wu Xiaomin, a researcher at the Animal Research Institute of Shaanxi Province (Northwestern Institute of Endangered Animals), said, "The return of Tibetan antelopes is the process of returning to their habitat with young children after the completion of the female herds ... The number of returns that initially left their areas of origin is larger, but the hidden antelopes will then return to their respective habitat along different geographical routes according to different geographical populations."
In order to ensure the safe return of the Tibetan antelope herds, journalists were informed that the former Changjiri administration of the Yangjiang Parks Administration had arranged for staff to conduct continuous video surveillance and district patrols in the main areas of the relocation.
If it is discovered that a herd is attempting to cross the road, the rangers will conduct temporary traffic control for the first time, allowing the herd to pass safely through wildlife passages and ensuring that it is as little disturbed as possible by humans on the way back.
So, what do we do in everyday life?
The experts suggest that summer days should be as warm as possible and that it would be better not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sun is the strongest and the heat is more likely to occur.
If you have to go out during this period, you have to do protective work like an umbrella, a hat, sunglasses, and the best conditions to wear sunscreen in case of sunburn.
The clothes are as light as possible, air-friendly as cotton, flax, silky, less corrugated assorted clothing, so as not to be able to evaporate the heat in time for the heavy sweating, causing the heat to catch heat.
When hot and hot, you have to prepare enough water to drink in time, and do not wait until you are thirsty, because once you feel thirsty, you need water, you have to drink water at 150 to 200 ml per drink, you drink hot and open water, you don't drink ice water.
Based on the high and low temperatures, average staff drink 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, and high-temperature operators drink 3 to 5 litres per day.
If you sweat more, you can properly supplement some salt water and make up for the salt lost by sweating.
Also, in summer, the human body is prone to a shortage of potassium, which makes people tired and uses potassium tea as an excellent summer drink.
Water-rich fruits such as raw vegetables, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc., can be used in summer to supplement water with fresh fruits such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, and water content of 80 to 90 per cent; dairy products can be used both to replenish water and to meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high-temperature environments should be properly supplemented with drinks containing potassium, magnesium, etc. ...
The summers are short, the temperatures are high, the humans are highly metabolic, and they are consumed, and they are easily exhausted.
Adequate sleep relaxes the brain and the system, both for work and learning and for prevention of heat and heat.
According to the experts, the best time to sleep is between 2200 and 2300 hours, and the best time to get up is between 5.30 and 6.30 p.m.
Don't lie under air conditioning vents and electric fans while you're sleeping, so you don't get air conditioners and hot wind.
Experts suggest that people who move outdoors or perform high-temperature work may carry 10 drops of water with them, such anti-smoking drugs as gluten, gluten or gluten gas pills, or place them in close proximity to the workplace and use them at any time in case of heat.
I want you to take some time to think about the very simple fact that, so far, much of what we know about the universe comes from light.
We stand on Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars in the sky with our naked eyes.
The strong sun so pierced the eyes.
We can see the light coming back from the moon.
Since Galileo aimed his poor astronomical telescope at the celestial bodies in the universe, to this day, the universe we know, through light, is before our eyes.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we've been able to gather spectacular, silent images of the universe -- a series of images dating back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a silent play, because the universe is not really silent.
I'd like to tell you that the universe has its own match, and the universe itself is playing on and on and on, because space can be as vibrating as a drum.
So when something big happens, it can make a series of noises to the universe.
Now, we want to be able to give this great visual work on the universe a voice.
Although we've never heard a sound from outer space, we should be able to turn it up in the next few years to hear what's going on there.
For this great goal of capturing the sound of the universe, we focus on the black hole and the prospects that it shows, because it makes a very special sound like the drumming drums, and I'm happy to play you some of the sound that we predicted.
One day we might see a shadow, a black hole that can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but it's not yet seen.
Although black holes can't be seen, they can be heard, because they hit time and space like drums.
The idea that the universe can sound like drums comes from Albert Einstein, and in fact many of our ideas come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this picture, except for the help lines that were painted on it.
But if we're free to fall in the universe, even without these aids, our tracks will draw these lines, because we'll find us moving along a straight line, along a straight line that doesn't bend, through the universe.
Einstein also realized that -- this is really the most critical part -- that if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe will bend, and objects of the free fall will be turned over to objects like the sun, moving along the path that is bent in space.
That's Einstein's great general relativity.
Even the path of light will be bent.
When it bends to a certain degree, it spins around the orbit of the sun, like the Earth around the sun, the moon around the Earth.
It's a natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you compressed the sun into a six-km diameter -- that is, you compressed a million times the mass of the Earth into a six-km diameter -- you would create a black hole in which the density of the object was so great that if the light was too close to it, it wouldn't be able to escape -- leaving a huge black shadow in the universe.
But Einstein always thought black holes were just a mathematical singularity.
He doesn't believe in a black hole.
He believes nature will stop the formation of black holes to protect us.
It was decades later that people began to use the term "black holes" and realized that black holes were real objects -- in fact, they were the dead state of stars of great mass, after a catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun doesn't collapse into a black hole.
It doesn't really have enough quality.
But if we do some thought experiments -- Einstein very much likes to do this -- we can imagine crushing the sun into a six-km radius, and then putting a little Earth around it, like 30 km from the black hole sun.
The Earth will glow itself, because now that the sun is gone, we have no other source of light -- so our little planet needs to shine itself.
You'll find that you can even put the Earth in orbit 30 km from the black hole and make it go around the orbit happy.
This black hole is about the size of Manhattan.
Before it destroys the Earth, it could swell into Hudson Street.
But that's basically what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object half as big as Manhattan.
So we're moving this planet close to the black hole -- 30 kilometers -- and we're seeing it orbiting the black hole in perfect orbit.
There are rumours that black holes will devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to be very close before you actually fall in.
But impressively, from our point of view, we can always see the Earth.
It can't hide behind a black hole.
The light from the Earth fell into a black hole, but there was another part that was bent by a black hole and we saw it.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If that's the story of the Fort Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun doesn't collapse into a black hole; it's not big enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them is eating up the galaxy, it'll look like this.
We will see the shadow of a black hole cast into the galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars and the dust belts that the stars light.
If we fall into this black hole, we see the light being refractured around the black hole, and we can't even feel some big changes happening at the beginning of this shadow.
If we tried to start the rocket and get out of there, it wouldn't be good, because we couldn't escape, not even the light could.
The black hole looks dark from the outside, but it doesn't, because the light of all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, because of the time-inflated effect of relativity, our clocks seem to be slower than the time of the galaxy, and it looks like the galaxy outside is accelerating, just before we're destroyed by a black hole.
It's like a near-death experience, and you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a complete death experience.
You can't tell anyone you saw light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we've never seen the shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they can't be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomeric view -- imagine two black holes that have existed together for a long time.
Maybe they used to be stars, and then they collapsed into two black holes -- 10 times the mass of each sun.
Now we're compressing them up to 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times per second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at the speed of light.
In this process, they not only bend space, but they also create a vibration of space in the tail flow behind it, a real wave of time and space.
When the black hole hits the universe, it squeezes and stretches the space.
These vibrations spread in space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was done by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Relativist Group in Goddard.
It took almost 30 years to solve this problem.
It's one of many groups.
It shows two black holes spinning around each other, and these are imaginary curves.
As you can see -- it may be a little blurry -- you can see the red waves being fired, and these are the gravitational waves.
They are the sound of the real universe, and these sound will spread out of these black holes at the speed of light in the process of combining them with each other, until the two black holes merge into a single black hole that spins quietly.
If you stand close enough, your ears will interact with the squeeze and stretching of these spaces.
You can really hear these voices.
Of course, you'll find out helplessly that your head is squeezed and stretched, so you may not understand what happened.
But I'd like to play the sound of our predictions for you.
This is my team's research-- a relatively brief calculation model.
Imagine a smaller black hole falling into a larger black hole.
The sound you hear comes from the collision of small-mass black holes with space as they approach large-mass black holes.
If they're far away, they'll sound very small.
But gradually the sound became like a drumming hammer, banging on space, making space vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what this voice will become.
We know that small-mass black holes get faster and louder in the fall.
In the end, we'll hear the little black hole fall completely into the big black hole.
I never thought it sounded that loud-- it was actually magnified here.
When I was at home, I thought it was a little hard to hear.
Sounds like, ding, ding, ding.
It's another sound that we've been simulated by our research team.
I'm not here to show you images, because black holes don't leave any useful trails, and real spaces don't show you virtual curves.
But if you hear that sound while you're on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run.
Better get away from that sound.
These two black holes are moving.
Two black holes approaching each other.
In this case, they're all rocking.
And then they'll all come together.
That sharp sound is a sign of the black hole's integration -- it's a sharp sound when it's over.
That's what we predict about what we're going to see.
Fortunately, we're very safe at Governor's Beach.
There is no doubt that, somewhere in the universe, two black holes have merged.
And it goes without saying that the space around us can feel the vibrating of a million light-years, or a million years ago, that they spread at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But these voices are too small for us to hear.
There are experiments in the world that take a lot of effort to build -- one of which is called LIGO -- that will detect space vibrations at a distance of every four kilometers less than one atomic nuclear range.
It's a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be overtaken in the next few years -- it will be used to detect space vibrations.
Another research project on the universe is expected to start in the next 10 years, called LISA.
LISA will see super-mass black holes -- millions or even billions of times the mass of the sun.
In the images from the Hubble Telescope, we see these two galaxies.
Looks like they're still hugging together.
Each of them may have a huge black hole of mass.
But they're not still, they're actually merging.
These two black holes will collide, and their integration will go through billions of years.
So collecting their voices is beyond the limits of our senses.
But the LISA can see that two of the super-massive black holes that began to merge very early on, that is, 15 minutes before they merged.
It's not limited to black holes, it's also used to detect any major disturbance in the universe, the biggest of which is the Big Bang.
When that word was created, some people mocked -- "Oh, who would believe the Big Bang?"
This is an animated video by my friend Proton Studios, which shows an external view of the Big Bang.
We would never really like to do that; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no such thing as being outside the universe.
So, imagine you're in the middle of a big explosion.
The universe is everywhere, and everything is surrounded by you, and space is swinging in order.
14 billion years have passed, and this voice still haunts us.
Galaxies gradually form, and a group of stars form in galaxies. At least one of these planets exists on a planet that is suitable for life.
Here, we're crazy about building experiments, doing calculations, writing computer codes.
Imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
It's been moving all the time.
We didn't even show up here.
It's getting closer -- 40,000 years ago, we painted on the cave wall.
If we're going to get a sound from the Big Bang, it sounds like this.
Technically, it's a noise.
It's a white noise, a messy bell.
But it's everywhere around us, as long as it's not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it's like music in our ears, because the quiet echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe that we look up.
So in the years to come, we'll be able to turn the music up a little bit, so that the universe will be in audio form for us.
But if we can detect the earliest moments, it will take us even further from understanding the Big Bang, and allow us to ask some of the most difficult, but also the most remote, questions.
If we play the universe backwards, we can know that there was a big explosion in the past, and we can even hear that loud noise, but is our big explosion the only big explosion in the universe?
I mean, we're gonna ask, have there been any similar big explosions before then?
Will it ever happen again?
I'd like to say that if the significance of this question rises to the level that TED advocates to trigger people to rethink, at least in this last minute, we can ask some questions, those that we may never answer.
But we can't help but ask: are our universes just an episode in a bigger history?
Or maybe we're just one of the branches of the polytheistic universe -- each of which has experienced its own big explosion -- and maybe some of them have black holes buzzing, maybe some of them not -- maybe some of them have conscious lives, maybe some of them don't exist -- and they don't belong to our past, or to our future, but are they connected to us in some way?
So we can't help but guess if there's a multi-polar universe, in other branches of this multipolar universe, there's life?
It's life in this multi-dimensional universe.
Are there any other life in the multiplicity of universes, and will they not also be guessing about our existence, thinking about their own origins?
If that's the case, I can imagine them, like us, doing calculations, developing computer codes, building experimental instruments, trying to detect the faint sound that came from their origins, and wondering who else was there.
Thank you.

Graduate art exhibition to market public goods exhibition - Xinhuanet
During the "Yun graduation" season in universities, a rare underline graduate art show was opened on weekends.
But it was not in the gallery, nor in the campus, but in the public space of the city of Yoo-yang and was open to the public free of charge until 23 August.
Journalists learned that the 2020 Graduate Art Fair, which collected 50 pieces/groups of work from 57 young artists from the Central School of Fine Arts, the Chinese Media University and the Tianjin School of Fine Arts, extended the exhibition space from 2nd to 6th floor and made full use of the building light box for the presentation of the flat works and maximized the artistic atmosphere during the graduation season.
In the event of the epidemic, this exhibition is of particular significance.
"We have chosen to bring back space to the "Cloud End" graduation show, and we want more people to see young people discover their own exploration and understanding of the world, and to magnify the healing power of art for society and the mind."
She revealed that the exhibition was a collection of graduates from several art colleges, from which they selected the most suitable for commercial displays in the form of traditional racks, sculptures, new media devices, interactive drawings, VR panorama, size and abundance.
Among them, Li Yunshaw expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a combination of mechanical and manual writings during the first battle of 2020; Liu Ka-young explored the themes of "encrypted currency", "credit creation", "transaction" through the work "Sound Money" written in the Tai-Pang chain; Zhang's "catwood" and Qiu Da-hung's" manifest themselves in animals often associated with human beings, where young artists can see their understanding of human-animal relationships; and the "winter of faith" in the work of the Jujufish was a reminder to growing-up young people that "when a career comes to fruition, remember the simple and sincere part of it."
Of the small number of graduates who have made their own show, there are Lee Kyung-chul from the sculpture department of the Tianjin School of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was a little worried about the epidemic, and I did a nucleic acid test three days in advance, with alcohol cotton and test reports."
His work, "Tomorrow's a mystery" is complicated and must be personal.
At the same time, he has the task of helping his classmates repair their damaged work.
"The show goes to 4:30 a.m., then it's fixed, it's tight, it's forgotten to take a picture of the work, and it's a little sad."
He hoped that when the epidemic stabilized, he would come to Beijing with his classmates to see his work show.

That morning, 65-year-old Bossonaro sent a photo on Twitter in which he was wearing sneakers, without a mask, sitting at a table with breakfast, smiling, holding his thumb up with one hand and holding up a box of hydrazine medicine with the other.
He wrote, "Good morning, everyone. New coronary virus test results: negative."
However, Bossonaro did not indicate when the new coronary virus was tested.
On 5 July there was a new coronary pneumonia in Bossonaro, the virus tested positive on 6 July, and on 7 July he announced on television that he had diagnosed new coronary pneumonia.
Two new coronary virus tests were conducted on 14 and 21 in Bosonaro, and the results were still positive.
During the isolation period, Bossonaro showed his hydrazine medications live on social media on several occasions and stated that hexachloroquine was very effective in treating the new coronary pneumonia, that it was very good and that it was in good health thanks to hydrazole, and that it was advocated for the use of hydrazole in Brazilian medical institutions to treat the new coronary pneumonia.
According to Brazilian media reports, five cabinet ministers and 10 governors have been diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia in Brazil to date.
A small Swiss plane in the Alps crashed, and all four people on board were killed.
On July 25, local time, the Swiss police informed the media that a small plane had crashed in the Swiss Alps.
Two Swiss and two Austrians were killed on board the accident.
According to reports, the canton of Wallis police in southern Switzerland stated that a small aircraft crashed more than 3,000 metres above sea level near Mount Alps, Valais, and that after the rescue personnel had arrived at the crash site, it was confirmed that all four people on board had been killed.
According to the Valle State police, witnesses called the police at 12.25 p.m. on 25th, saying that they had witnessed a small plane falling from the sky.
A few minutes later, the witness again informed the police that smoke was coming out of the crash site.
The police quickly coordinate fire officers, medical and rescue personnel and take a helicopter to the scene of the accident.
When the rescue crew arrived at the crash site, it was found that all four people on board had been killed.
The police verified that the victims of the accident included two Swiss, aged 50 and 66, and two Austrians, aged 46 and 50.
The police indicated that they were currently working with the Swiss Transport Security Investigation Commission to investigate the cause of the crash.
In Chongqing, 33 districts and districts have been hit by heavy rains, flood yellow and orange warnings - the new Chinese net.
On 26 July, a journalist from Chongqing City Water Department (journalist Yoo Sang-yeon) was told that heavy rains had hit 33 districts in Chongqing in the last 24 hours, including 16 districts.
Heavy rains have caused 71 small and medium rivers to rise, and two flood warnings have been issued on the ground.
According to the General Hydrological Monitoring Station in Chongqing, from 0800 hours on 25th to 0800 hours on 26th, most areas of Chongqing were hit by heavy rains.
There were heavy rains in 33 districts, including Kana, Kai, and Soho Creek, in 16 districts; the largest daily rainfall occurred in Yongshan village in Kanshan Town, Nanchu, at 197.5 mm.
There's a 1 to 7-metre upswing in 71 small and medium-sized rivers, including the South River of Kaiju, where the maximum level of water is not overguarded.
Between 0800 hours on 26 and 0800 hours on 27 July, it is expected that small and medium-sized rivers in the Chongqing area may have increased water to varying degrees and that individual small and medium-sized rivers may be exposed to super-police flooding.
At the same time, attention will be paid to the possible flooding of the Yangtze, the Kaal River.
The CBA has the first audience to watch after the season.
2020-07-26:26:01 Source: China News Network.
According to the CBA league official, the CBA Qingjia is finally home to the first fans to come back to the game today.
On-site fans included mobile workers from Qingdao, doctors, teachers, public security personnel, etc. who made an outstanding contribution to society during the epidemic. On July 31, the CBA after season, which will officially resume selling tickets to Qingdao fans.
In the aftermath of the epidemic, the CBA tournament resumed on June 20, almost five months after its interruption.
Although there was a small audience for the 26th afternoon, the feeling of the field was already clear: there was applause and there was silence.
It's been a long time since the players on the field came up against the needles, and the fans on the ground fought against the court.
In the after season game, if fans want to watch the game live, these are going to be noticed.
This open-end fan buys tickets at the Qingjima Sports Center ' s Diamond Stadium (Sunsan District), the sale of tickets is fully implemented on-line by means of a live-in ticket system, all fans must be 12 years old and have a nucleic acid test within 48 hours.
I'll give you $50,000.
On 26 July, the Hubei Daily News (journalist Lin Jing), Eunshi City reported that Chen Xiang, a geohazard site monitor who had made an important contribution to the early warning of the sand dam landslide, had sent him $50,000 in prizes.
At the same time, they call on the entire party cadre to learn his commitment, his commitment, his initiative and his dedication.
On 21 July, a landslide in the sand dam in the village of Tumburg, Nsh City, led to the formation of a lake in the Qingjiang Riverway. Chen Xian, age 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of 17 July, Chen Xiang was informed of the breaking of the walls of the villagers ' homes and immediately visited the scene.
Just five or six hundred meters out of his house, he saw a group of village roads cracking four or five centimetres and stretching down the road to the cornfield, about 50 metres long.
Chen Xianxian was alert and sent photos of the first break of the road to the village Geological Disaster Monitor Contact.
Following on-site inspection and judgement by the relevant officials of the Tumborg Township Natural Planning Institute, the possibility of a landslide was high and a decision was taken to evacuate the crowd.
Chen Xiang's timely warning won 36 hours of valuable time for the safe evacuation of 1,339 people in 315 families in the affected area.
No one was killed or killed in this major geological disaster.
Chen Xiang's responsible and responsible professionalism has been praised by the public.

Researchers at the University of Monash, Australia, are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that it will be used to treat vascular congestion caused by the new coronary virus.
Researchers have found that an enzyme in a blood plate accelerates blood plate condensation before a heart attack or a stroke.
As a result, they develop a drug that temporarily inhibits plaque condensation, thus avoiding blood-vascular congestion and preventing heart disease and stroke.
According to researchers, this drug only inhibits the coagulation effect of blood platelets in the event of a heart attack or a stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular congestion is one of the leading causes of death for patients with new coronary diseases, researchers hope that this drug will be used in the future for the treatment of such patients.
At present, the drug has worked well in animal modelling experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The results of the research were published in the U.S. Journal of Science and Conversion.
He became the first audience to come after the CBA tournament resumed to allow the audience to watch the game live.
On that day, in the second phase of the Chinese men ' s basketball tournament (CBA) resumed in Qingdao, Shandong, from 2019 to 2020, medical personnel, teachers, public security front personnel passed the official ticket purchase platform and completed the related process, including the nucleic acid test, and came to watch the Shanghai Kuge team fight against the Mount East and West Kings.
During the game, the contestants must wear a mask and take a seat at a strict distance of one metre.
When you leave, the audience will have to move forward in the order between the two sides and the social distance of one metre.
Xinjiang Farming to Sunseta with Clean Energy - Middle New Network
2020-07-26 15:43:42 Source: China News Network.
Xinjiang Hami 26 July, Chinese News Agency, called Xinjiang Deep Farming to Sunseta with clean energy.
More than 6000 pentagonal sunglasses, 48 square metres each, rounded and neat, like a silver "Sunshine" that moves with the sun and reflects the sun to the center's 200 metre-high insortion towers to generate electricity.
Reporter 25 saw this scene at the Harmi Molotov cocktail-type light-throat power plant in the town of Lake Frou, Igu County, Xinjiang.
" The so-called molten salt tower light-fired power generation is the reflection of solar light through mirrors to create heat in the soaking towers, and the conversion of thermal energy into electricity through traditional power generation technologies ... "
Jang Yong, Deputy General Manager, China-Home Solar Heat and Power Company Ltd., introduced the idea that it was designed in a way similar to the solar stove used in rural areas of the northwest of China, and that it would bring the sun together.
Construction of the plant began in October 2017 and was completed at the end of last year, with 6,600 acres of land, with a total planned installation of 14,500 sunglasses.
"The greatest advantage of the traditional solar power generation technology is that it can store concentrated thermal energy and generate electricity at night ... "
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour thermal storage system deployed by the project would allow the generator team to operate in a continuous and stable manner, free from light changes; it could also participate rapidly in the power grid rotations based on the needs of the grid load valley.
When fully completed, the project will achieve an annual power generation of 198 million degrees, save more than 60,000 tons of coal per year, reduce the emissions of more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, approximately 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a source of sustainable clean energy to the local population.
In addition to that, there's another silver "Achita Sunseta" in Shizuku City, Hammi City.
The Hamifor Photovoltaic Solar Power Station occupies more than 2,300 acres of land, and the 714 installed power plants follow the sun in the same direction, keeping the sun light and the photoplate in 90 degrees straight.
" We use two-axis tracking of concentrated light power generation technology, and through integrated integrated control, all power generation equipment will maintain the efficiency of power generation in accordance with the angle adjusted to the Sun ' s altitude ... "
The station's chief, Monki, said that, in light weather conditions, the power generation technology could be about 20 per cent more efficient than the conventional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of the year, the station has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing the local demand for electricity.
Ishigami Photovoltage is currently the largest single-body Xinjiang, with the largest type of photovoltaic component as a demonstration park for the photovoltaic industry, with 38 projects for photovoltaic power with a total capacity of 820,000 kW.
In the first half of the year, more than 110 million degrees of electricity generation were completed, an increase of 6 per cent over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best places in China with solar energy.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megacalories per square metre, approximately 3,200 hours a day.
In recent years, the city has developed a vastly luminous industry that grows "Sunshine".
The scale of solar power generation, installed at more than 2.5 million kilowatts, exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the city in the first half of the year, an increase of about 14 per cent in the same year.
At present, Xinjiang has more than 330 photovoltaic power stations with a capacity of over 10 million kW.
Photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees throughout the year, replacing the standard coal by more than 6 million tons.
Police are reporting details of the loss of female university students' travel to the Qinghai Sea.
Xinning, Xinning, Xinhua Society, has recently lost contact with a female student on a trip to Qinghai Gaewood.
Qinghai Province ' s Department of Public Security in the city of Germu, Hei-Mong ethnic Tibetan Autonomous Oblast, reported that a student from a university in Nanjing is still in a state of disassociation and that the police are actively engaged in search work along a lost land in Qinghai province.
On 10 July 2020, the security unit of the Ghorgi City Public Security Department in Heisy County was informed by its superiors that a student from a university in Nanjing who was travelling from Nanjing to Ghorgi on 5 July in a Z164 train, and that on 9 July, he had lost a hand-held device in the south-west part of the river at the Sonamdaj Protection Station in the Tamarai District, Tamaki Tibetan Autonomous State, Qinghai Province, and requested assistance in locating him.
According to the investigation conducted by the public security bureau of the city of Ghorgi, Huang Xiao entered the territory of Qinghai province at 1954 hours on 6 July and arrived in the city of Ghormu at 0400 hours on 7 July.
At 0800 hours on the same day, the missing person, a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in the city of Ghorgi, headed towards G109, arrived at 1200 hours at the Coco Sicily Sonam Daje protection station, and the taxi driver returned alone, reaching the area of the river near the Sonandaje protection station at 1500 a.m. on some seven days until 1800 a.m. on 9 September.
In a further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed the Nagui Gorge checkpoint at 1707 hours on 13 July.
In view of the lack of video surveillance at the Nacqui checkpoint in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, which was set up at the south entrance of the city of Ghormu, where it was impossible to determine who was involved and the vehicles on which they were travelling, the police were able to search by car and coordinate the discovery of the yellow at various checkpoints along the Tibetan route with the public security department of the city of Ghormu immediately.
According to the latest information, at 1 a.m. on 26 July, the Ghorgi City Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to the shelter station of the unfrozen spring along the Qingzhou highway, which was searched and actively contacted the Sichuan police, the Tibetan police, the Nanjing police and worked together, and search and rescue efforts are continuing.
The local police would like a wide range of online and social sources to provide information to both the Gergim police and the Nanjing Jiangning police in a timely manner, with a view to finding the missing person at an early date.
At the same time, experts suggest that tourists should be regulated, rational, civilized, always aware of roadside warning signs, never risk entering an uninhabited area, in case of an emergency, and promptly report to the police.
The American media revealed the truth about the unprovoked US demand that China close the Consulate General in Houston.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Imaging Network
The American media revealed the fact that the American side had no reason to demand that China close the Consulate General in Houston.
On 24 November, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China of China ' s decision to withdraw the permit for the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and to make a specific request to the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities as a countermeasure to the sudden request by the United States to close the Consulate General in Houston on 21st.
This act of the United States Government is a source of concern, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign agents and scholars.
Why do you ask China to close the Consulate General?
According to many foreign agents, it is not clear why the United States would choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media say so openly: for the sake of the general election ...
CNN 23 reported that the United States demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston had raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the United States Government’s disastrous response to the new crown epidemic caused President Trump’s low rate of pre-election support.
White House officials privately claimed that the hard-line strategy with China was to save Trump's support, but also to shift responsibility for failing the White House epidemic.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a "politically driven and cautious" target chosen by the United States Government to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict.
The BBC also believes that when the US election season came and the US economy was severely hit by the epidemic, Trump thought that playing "China card" had a political advantage.
The current state of affairs is a spiral-up, inverse struggle, driven in part by the United States Government from a domestic point of view, which only exacerbates tensions between the United States and China.
According to the CBS, Trump’s prospects for re-election have been strained by the outbreak, and he has repeatedly accused China of the epidemic.
There are almost daily new actions in the United States against Trump's preposterous claim that China exploits America.
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the United States demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston had exacerbated tensions between the two largest economies in the world ...
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the south of the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do United States citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret that the United States had asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, stating that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
The American Foreign Policy magazine website believes that this American move is part of a series of provocative initiatives that only worsen US-China relations.
Reuters quotes Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia from the Brookings Institution of the American think tank, who said that since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he has had no idea that any action could be compared to this action by the United States against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
According to the Hong Kong South China Morning Post, this move by the United States was unprecedented in the diplomatic relations between China and the United States for more than 40 years.
According to analysts, this move could cause persistent damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and was the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China has an embassy and five consulates in the United States.

In response to new changes in the prevention and control of the epidemic, since 17 July Xinjiang trade unions have been actively involved in the prevention and control of the epidemic, in response to the call of the General Union of the Autonomous Communities.
The Tianshan-North trade union cadres, workers, job models went into the street community, and among the population, they carried out activities such as the delivery of vegetables, the disinfection of bacteria, the promotion of vaccinations, and the provision of services to the workers and the demonstration of the union's "hard nuclear power" with practical actions.
In recent days, the Tianshan General Trade Union in Urumqi sent urgently needed supplies to staff in 12 isolation points.
In the wake of the epidemic, more than 1.05 million yuan was spent for the first time in the Tianshan region, and 23 direct trade unions were allocated on an emergency basis.
Deputy Secretary of the Xinjiang Construction Worker I Party, and President of the trade union, Zhao Sang-guk, after being informed of the company ' s prevention of the epidemic, offered to stay on duty to protect the workers.
He delivers cookers, food and daily items for workers living in the dormitories and new recruits, and arranges for them to be provided with essential supplies every two days.
"As of 21 July, a survey was carried out of the cadres on the front line of the war `epidemic' and, by means of the down-and-down order, the merchants delivered the goods to the door, by means of which 704 front-line workers in the Urumqi area were supplemented with sanitary supplies and living materials... "
The Xinjiang Trade Union leader told journalists that in the face of the outbreak, they were fully committed to securing services to prevent and control the epidemic, steadily promoting transport development and creating a strong climate for fighting the epidemic.
At this time of summer heat, trade unions focus on frontline workers in priority areas of epidemic prevention and control, putting "Save the Cool" in practice.
On 19 July, the General Union of Urumqi County launched a "blind-out" condolence campaign for frontline workers in the area of outbreak control. The county police station, the Cards and the health system received condolence items such as drinks and fruit.
"Commonwealth officials need to step up their political positions, strengthen their responsibilities, take care of the warmth of the people and inspire action.
Trade union organizations must play their part in bringing together workers, unifying them, ensuring that they are protected against the disease, actively defending the health of workers in general, and bringing care to front-line workers. "

Speaker at the British Embassy: The Chinese Government is a firm defender of cyber security - China New Network
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on 25 July, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom asked journalists about false statements about cyber attacks.
The Chinese Government, as a firm defender of cyber security, had always firmly opposed and combated cyberattacks and cybercrime in all its forms.
Questions were asked by journalists: according to the media, hacker groups linked to China had interfered with a British company network, launched an attack on British-American technology companies with proprietary data, and invaded the European Union national government network.
The Chinese Government, as a firm defender of cyber security, had always firmly opposed and combated cyberattacks and cybercrime in all its forms.
The virtual nature of cyberspace, the difficulties of traceability, the diversity of actors and the need to produce sufficient evidence to justify the investigation and characterization of cyber-events ...
According to the speaker, a series of past events, such as the Prism Gate, had proved that the United States had been conducting the largest cyber-tapping operation in the world.
It is in the common interest of all States to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
China ' s achievements in science, technology and innovation had not been stolen, but had been made through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted some 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a power of innovation and intellectual property.
According to data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People ' s Bank of China, in the first half of the year, new loans from Xinjiang-based farmers and micro-enterprises were increased by over 2019.
During the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People ' s Bank used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking sector in increasing lending and providing adequate financial guarantees for the prevention of the epidemic and the resumption of work.
Most of Urumqi's free nucleic acid tests are almost complete.
In a briefing on the latest outbreak and nucleic acid test in the city of Urumqi, Zhang Wei, Director of the Urumqi City Health Commission, on 26 July, Urumqi, China-News Network (journalist Sun Tinwen Zhao Yamin), stated that most of the free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi city is now almost complete.
The development of the epidemic is being further assessed by experts from the State Council and the Autonomous Region, Urumqi City, based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiology surveys.
The Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region Press Office held a press conference on 26th to inform about the Xinjiang epidemic and its prevention and control.
According to him, between 000 and 2400 hours on 25 July, 22 new cases of coronary pneumonia were diagnosed in the city of Urumqi (of which 5 were confirmed cases of an asymptomatic infection) and 38 new cases of an asymptomatic infection.
As at 2400 hours on 25 July, 135 confirmed cases and 147 cases of unsymptomatic infections were reported in the city of Urumqi.
Most of the 25 new cases of non-symptomatic infection were screened on their own initiative through a city-wide free nucleic acid test.
On 26 June, Zhang Wei, Director of the Urumqi City Health Commission, stated that most of the free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi city was almost complete.
He added that, from experience in other parts of the country, there were a number of factors affecting the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the test agent, the time of infection and discharge of the person being tested, the cooperation of the person being tested at the time the sample was taken, which could result in the specimen being unattended, and the environment for testing, and the proficiency of the person being tested.
For a variety of reasons, nucleic acid tests also have false negative results.
Fake negative means that the person tested is infected, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, in the case of confirmed cases, persons with close contact with suspected cases usually require two nucleic acid tests to remove them.
For those who have gone to high-risk areas of the epidemic, it is possible that a negative nucleic acid test may be present in case of fever and respiratory symptoms, and therefore two nucleic acid tests are required to exclude it.
In view of the above, he states that, for the sake of the health of the entire city's population, the city of Urumqi will, from today's date, conduct a second free test of nucleic acid in the Tianshan, the Shaibak district and other priority areas, together with a "recovering leaks".
In the Tianshan region, the Shaibak district is known to be a high-risk area.
We've got a lot of industry confidence in Shanghai International Film Festival.
2020-07-26 06:52:39 Source: Reporter, Wang Si-seok
We've got a lot of industrial confidence at the Shanghai International Film Festival.
Yesterday, the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival of 2020, organized in the context of strict quarantine measures, opened the scene of the twenty-third Shanghai International Film Festival with an industry summit forum entitled "All-out, Dreaming of the New Age".
This year ' s Shanghai International Film Festival is significant as the first international video festival since the global epidemic continued to spread and our epidemic was regularized.
The Shanghai International Film and Television Festival, which builds on efforts to combat the epidemic, is both a sign of confidence and a sign of determination – our determination to fight the epidemic, our resolve to hold people's holidays, our resolve to build a global centre for film creation, and our resolve to sound the name "Shanghai culture" .
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with its innovative, progressive gestures, is a fresh start.
Therefore, every step needs to be taken to serve the spiritual well-being of the population and the high-quality development of the visual industry.
This year, more than ever.
In order to value the hard-won epidemic prevention and control situation, Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, has strictly adhered to the requirements of the disease prevention and control measures, and, on the other hand, has launched multi-sectional activities under the line, with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the needs of the fans.
On the first day of the opening day, from under-line viewing to industry forums, film festival-related events strictly implemented the relevant vaccination policy.
Forum activities are controlled by up to 50 people, with each sighting being isolated and with a tight seating rate of up to 30 per cent.
As the Film Festival Committee holds, "in any case, putting the lives of the people first and the health of the people first" is a big premise.
We've got a lot of down-line activity. We've got a lot of fun on the clouds.
To implement the important concept of "People's Cities: People's Cities for People", this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is an occasion for people to innovate, seek transformation, use online "Cloud Shows" and masters' "Cloud Sharing" initiatives to meet the diverse needs of fans.
On the first day of the opening day, the film festival's official partners, the Micah Video and the Orient Pearl Vision, will each have a series of "Swipes of Videos" on the clouds, giving back their fans.
That night, the King's inaugural forum and Master Jashenko were also video-taping, learning about powerful countries, and we're getting online on platforms like App, to keep people from going to the house and keeping track of the latest developments in Chinese films.
At yesterday ' s inaugural forum, the Vice-President and member of the Central Radio and Television Party, Jin Xiaoming, delivered a speech and declared the opening of the film festival, which was delivered by the Standing Committee of the Shanghai City Council, the Minister of Advocacy, Zhou Hye Lin, and the Deputy Mayor, Zong Ming.
White House epidemiologist Foggy: cautiously optimistic about the vaccine being developed in early 2021.
Fuch 25 made the above statement at a web-based video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation.
He warned that it was not clear how the new crown epidemic would develop in autumn or winter or what its ultimate impact would be, and that the only way to end it was for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, the number of newly diagnosed cases in the United States had reached 4,176,000 as at 2100 hours on 25 February, with 146,000 deaths.
Foggy says that some parts of the United States are now struggling with a rebound.
Although the epidemic varies from one region to another and requires tailored responses, a diversified response does not mean that there is no close connection between the regions.
The epidemic in one region will eventually affect the rest of the world.
"This is no time for complacency," Foggy said, "Our work is not done, we must step up our efforts, and we must be vigilant about the uncertainty of the future."
A Chinese medical expert and founder of the AIDS cocktail therapy pointed out at the conference that America's new crown epidemic has not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus... "
What's the big call for the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the development of new canopy treatment drugs and vaccines ...
International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization aimed at promoting international exchanges between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region, working to promote Asia-Pacific Americans and foster international youth leaders.
On the same day, the United States Secretary of Transport, Zhao Xiaolan, the United States Congressman Mon Zhao Wen and the President of the International Leadership Foundation, Dong Ji-Ling, addressed the meeting.
They paid special tribute to Asian and Pacific medical workers and volunteers on the front line of the epidemic, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to the rules of immunization such as "social distance" to curb the spread of the epidemic.

The Brazilian study shows that hydrochlorine is not effective for new coronary pneumonia for the treatment of light-mediatic diseases - the Chinese net.
In recent days, a Brazilian study has shown that hydrochlorine is not effective against new coronary pneumonia.
The study was published in New England Journal of Medicine.
Palestinian researchers divided 667 patients in 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials; mainly comparing the treatment effects of the use of hydroxyl chloride alone or with other antibiotics, analysing whether it helped to improve the condition of the mild and moderate patients of the new coronary pneumonia.
The results show that not only is hydrochlorine not therapeutic, but it can have harmful side effects on the dirty apparatus.
The study was carried out in conjunction with the Brazilian Clinical Research Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Network for Critical Care Research (BRICNet) by a number of authoritative Brazilian hospitals, such as the Espital Israelia Albert Einstein, the Heart Disease Hospital (HCor), the Syrian Lebanese Hospital (Sírio-Libanês).
On the 25th of local time, Brazilian President Bossonaro declared the fourth nucleic acid test negative through a social platform.
During the infection, Bossonaro was on hydrazine and was active on a number of occasions.

On 25th, the first Red Tourism Festival in Hunan, 2020, and the first Red Cultural Industry Expo, will be inaugurated in Tsangshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has grown.
However, the development of the red tourism industry also faces the dilemma of a small number of young people, homogenization of tourist projects and a single channel for commercialization.
In particular, this year's outbreak hit the country's cultural and tourist industry severely, and red tourist attractions face serious challenges.
For example, the use of drones, such as VR immersion experiences, can satisfy visitors' needs for "unattended, unattended" tours; the introduction of live webcasts to promote red scenes, which can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of "cloud" techniques, which highlight themes, point out and provide a rich display of fine red scenes, and fully showcase and enhance the promotional function of red scenes; and the innovation of red culture to make revolutionary monuments "live" , to popularize red tourism, to keep red genes alive and to increase the attractiveness of red attractions.
The festival, using the popular "City Chiefs + Professionals' Centers" to promote Red Wehrmacht specialty products, and the 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and intelligent city demonstrations to promote redweed attractions, are all attempts to insert intelligent wings for red tourism, and expect that the Hunan Red Tour will become more popular.
A representative of the US-China Trade Conference has been summoned to meet in August.
The Hong Kong South China Morning Post, 25, quoted an anonymous source who reported that the head of China's trade negotiation team, Deputy Prime Minister Liu Xuan, and the co-leader of the US team, the trade representative Lai Hae-chul, were expected to hold a formal meeting in August to assess the implementation of the first stage of the US-China trade agreement between the two sides.
It has been reported that while China has significantly increased its procurement of United States agricultural products over the past few months, there is still some distance from the volume promised in trade agreements due to the new coronary virus epidemic, among other things.
According to analysts, the recent closure of the consulates of the United States and China, coupled with other disputes, could undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first-stage trade agreement between China and the United States, which entered into force one month after its signature on 15 January, provided for a high-level trade framework group between the two sides to meet biannually.
According to sources, this meeting will be an important turning point for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
But the same man said that if the tension between the United States and China led to a lack of willingness to talk at this time, both sides might agree that the telephone conference of 8 May between Rae Hae-chul and crane Liu had met the terms of the biannual talks in the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of the year, relations between China and the United States have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes over the origins of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
President Trump, while boasting at the beginning of the year about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, has recently changed his attitude.
At a White House press conference, he said that although China had recently bought a record number of corn from the United States on a single day, and had bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade deal meant less to me than it was when it was done."
An anonymous Beijing government consultant also argued that a new round of trade negotiations was unlikely to take place because of poor relations between the United States and China, and that "trade issues have lost weight in China-United States relations".
But he revealed that China ' s trade-related units still met on 23th to discuss a number of issues, including how to increase the volume of imports from the United States, "we've done our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
The Vice-President of the US-China Trade Commission, Peng Jianning, said that it was "more important than ever" to keep the first phase of the agreement, and that China had made progress this year in opening up its financial markets further to US companies.
"It's better to talk than not to talk, even though it might be just routine."
Xinhua Society, Beijing 26 July, journalist (journalist Wei Yu Gon) was informed by the Ministry of Emergency Management that the Ministry of National Defence and Emergency Management, in conjunction with the National Food and Material Reserve Agency, had once again urgently transferred 1.35 million knitting bags, 1.2 million m2 of knitting, 130,000 m2 of earthwork cloths and six categories of central stocks to support flood recovery and rescue efforts.
According to the head of the Department of Emergency Management, at present, the Yangtze river basin maintains high water level volatility in the lower and middle of the Yangtze River, which was created on the upper side of the Yangtze River by flood No. 3 of 2020, with increased local risk.
The Meteorological Department expects heavy rains in Chongqing, Guizhou, the middle and lower areas of the Yangtze River over the next three days.
It was reported that, since entering the country, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed integrated national fire rescue teams to pre-position specialized rescue units in priority areas, participating in a total of 10364 flood rescue operations involving more than 130,000 fighters, 17778 fire trucks, 11887 boats, 37,777 people in distress, and the evacuation and transfer of more than 107,000 people in distress.
Nazdak China District Chief Representative Xiang Sheng: It's now China's best time node for IPOs in the United States - Economic Watch - professional financial news site
The economic watch network, journalist Zhang Bin, has imposed stricter regulation on the Chinese capital in the United States market due to the counterfeiting of Rising's coffee, coupled with a long period of valuation pressure, stress on the Chinese stock market in the United States, Internet access, and the recent launch of the Chinese capitalist return to Hong Kong.
And lately, Shells, ideal cars, and so on, have been showing up in the United States.
Is it the best time for Chinese businesses to go to the United States in the midst of the epidemic and the Chinese crisis?
"In the case of recent IPOs, and in the case of companies going to the United States of America, IPOs are inherently unaffected. Instead, the market is now very good, and even now is the best time point for Chinese companies to go to IPOs in the last 10 years. "
The Chief Representative of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange of China District, Xiao Sheng, said at the 2020 World Summit of Company Leaders hosted by Snowball.
In April of this year, the United States Securities and Inspection Commission (SEC) and the United States Public Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued a "Statement on the Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information – Discussion of the Challenges of Access to Current Information for US Listed Companies with Large Businesses in China".
The statement states that, while international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, problems in access to information persist in the United States regulatory sector, and both SEC and PCAOB continue to face legal and practical challenges; in contrast to this document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies that have encountered audit barriers and their audit institutions, with a large number of central stock companies.
In addition, in May this year, the Senate of the United States Congress passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Bill, which introduced additional disclosure requirements for foreign companies to be listed in the United States.
The crisis in China has not affected the appetite of investors.
"When the news first came out, everyone was wondering if they could still go to the United States, but then we found out that these issues were not on the investors' side, and that investors might ask them, or even become, standardized when they were on their way to the United States IPO, but that was not seen by investors as an important factor in their investment against a Chinese company.
It is recommended that you try to look at the situation as usual.
Of course, this may appear to be the worst situation in the last two years, but the investor's appetite is not affected at all.
So the tide of IPOs in the United States will continue from now until the end of this year or before the United States elections. "
On May 9th of this year, Kim Shanyun was officially listed in NASDAQ in the United States as the first Chinese company to go to IPO after the outbreak.
"Kim Shanyun's listing gives a lot of confidence to the Chinese company that prepared the IPO. "
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure.
In the first half of the year 2020, snowball released a report showing that in the first half of the year there were 20 IPO-China enterprises going to the United States, an increase of 17.6 per cent over the same period last year; In terms of total initial funding, 20 enterprises raised a total of 2.725 billion, a recovery from the same period last year, an increase of over 52.4 per cent; In the first half of the year, the number of IPOs in the health-care sector was remarkable, a 100 per cent increase over the same period last year.
According to Chen Sheng, Chinese companies that went to the US for IPOs in the first half of this year are of high quality, with strong fundamentals and growth-oriented quality companies that are more favoured by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Chen Sheng continues to be optimistic about Ming China going to the U.S. IPO.
"In the short term, the tide of IPOs continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options, A shares, Hong Kong shares, United States shares, and the United States shares, and the United States general elections and relations between the United States and China will be considered as market choices and timing considerations; in the long run, everything will return to normality, market fluctuations will be cycles, political cycles and economic cycles, and eventually return to the normal stage, and the stock market will always be volatile."
At the same time, he said, "There are many uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, regardless of whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are strong and grow to be seen by investors, other factors are relatively minor, and investors need to invest in good Chinese companies."

People's Daily Commentator: Focusing on what you do, building new advantages for future development — the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneurs Symposium — Xinhua Network
Xinhua News, July 25th, Beijing, July 26th, commenter, People's Daily: Focusing on what's best for you, building new advantages for future development.
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain serious and complex, and the challenges facing our development are unprecedented.
Keeping strategic, increasing the confidence to win and concentrating our efforts on our own is key to addressing all the risks we face.
At the recent entrepreneurship symposium, Secretary-General Xi Jinping stressed that, in the current external environment of rising protectionism, a depressed world economy and shrinking global markets, we must concentrate on our own tasks, taking full advantage of domestic megamarket advantages, gradually developing new patterns of development based on domestic and international two-cycles that are mutually reinforcing, raising the level of modernization of the supply chain of the industrial chain, promoting technological innovation, accelerating the entry of key core technologies and building new advantages for future development.
The mind of the man, the mind of the man, wins.
In an external environment characterized by deep economic globalization, markets and resources have played an important role in the country's rapid development.
Now, the world under the shock of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, with more instability and uncertainty, and economic globalization is facing a backwind and a back wave.
To prepare our economy for long periods of thinking and work in response to changes in the external environment and to take advantage of the wind and the wind, and to move further forward, one of the most important aspects is to use the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as a strategic basis for development, to take full advantage of its strengths and to give impetus to the economic recovery of the world through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the opening of the domestic cycle.
We need to be deeply aware that the long-term development and long-term security of our country are linked to the construction of a complete system of domestic demand.
The Party's central review of the state of affairs clearly sets out a firm strategy for the expansion of domestic demand, which is needed to respond to the impact of the epidemic, to sustain the long-term healthy development of the country's economy and to meet the growing need for a better life for its people.
The advantage of big economies is internal circulation.
We have the most complete and large industrial system in the world, strong productive capacity, well-developed and complementary capacities, with more than 100 million market subjects and more than 170 million people with higher education or specialized skills, as well as a super-large domestic demand market of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, in a new phase of industrialization, informationization, urbanization and rapid agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
The system of public ownership, the co-development of various forms of ownership, the distribution of labour, the coexistence of various forms of distribution, the socialist basic economic system, such as the socialist market economy system, both stimulates the dynamism of the various types of market subjects, liberates and develops social productivity, promotes efficiency and equitable organic integration, and continuously achieves common wealth.
We need to firmly grasp the strategic basis for expanding domestic demand, enabling production, distribution, greater reliance on domestic markets for a virtuous circle of flow links, defining strategic directions for structural reforms on the supply side, and promoting a dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
To accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, to vigorously promote innovation in science, technology and all other aspects of innovation, to accelerate the development of the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, health of life, new materials, and other strategic and emerging industries, to create new and additional growth points, growth poles, and to evolve into new patterns of development based on domestic and international cycles that are mutually reinforcing.
Openness leads to progress, closure necessarily lags behind.
Secretary-General Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that the door open in China will not be closed, but will only be opened wider.
By focusing on the domestic cycle, it is not by closing the doors, but by harnessing the potential of domestic demand to better connect domestic and international markets, make better use of both international and domestic markets, and both resources to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between the expansion of domestic demand and openness, and the smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to the construction of new patterns of openness and the more conducive it is to the creation of new advantages for participation in international cooperation and competition.
While there is now a rise in international protectionist thinking, we must stand on the right side of history and insist on deepening reforms, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting an open world economy and building a community of human destinies.
The Chinese nation has experienced many hardships in its history, but it has never been crushed, but it has grown stronger and stronger, growing up in its ordeal and rising from it.
With the strong leadership of the Party ' s central centre, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the remarkable strength of the socialist system of China, its strong mobilization and strong combined strength, and the unity of the nation ' s entire army, we will be able to overcome all odds and obstacles, maintain the momentum of good economic and social development in our country, achieve the full realization of a small and prosperous society and successfully begin a new journey towards the full construction of a modern socialist State!
The balance money goes down after "90" instead of "retaliatory"?
With the balance money going down, not only did `after '90' not run away from the balance, but instead it started to "retrieve" the money?
According to the "Breaths after 90 Report" (2020th edition) issued by the China Institute for New Economic Research, the first half of the year, "Breath after 90" is a better saver: per capita savings are nearly 40% higher than in 2019.
Interestingly, after 90, it's more likely to start with a small amount of money, 60% of the average amount saved is less than $20...
Save the money with the balance, it's also the "after 90" way of saving the money.
According to the data, of the 700 million users of the balance, 134 million are after 90 years.
China has 174 million "after 90", which means that about three out of every four "after 90" in China are saving their money.
At present, the annualized rate of return on 7 days for monetary funds, such as the balance sheet, has fallen from above 2 per cent at the beginning of the year to around 1.5 per cent.
Even so, it doesn't affect the pace of after-90 savings.
And in the context of the "saving effect" of the balance, a number of young people who used the balance money directly turned into "Kimin."
Data on payment treasures show that, as of 13 July, the number of new "gills" paid in the last month had increased by more than one-fold over the same period, and that more and more young people were making progress on payment.
According to analysts, the flow of funds from the balance sheet to the stock market was also an important reason for the clear decline in the IMF share in June.
The report also shows that "after 90" girls tend to save more, on average 20 per cent more than boys; 60 per cent of the users of funds on payment platforms are men, and women tend to choose a more prudent financial approach than men.
After saving money, what's the plan after 90?
The paycheck data show that after 90 is used to saving money, and travel is used as a goal for the most users.
In the aftermath of the epidemic, many "after-90s" save money to prepare for post-epidemic travel; the re-opening of cinemas also provides a new way to move from saving money to consumption.

Palley told the newspaper Provence that between 2019 and 2025, the budget for spending on French space military projects would increase from €3.6 billion (approximately $4.2 billion) previously proposed to €4.3 billion (US$5 billion).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and modernize its space surveillance radar.
The President of France, Emmanuel Markron, announced last July that a military space command and "Air and Space Force" would be established within the French air force.
Pali said that she would officially announce the establishment of this space force when she visited a military school in Salon, Provence district, later.
Pali said that the space force was part of the air force and had 500 men by 2025.
She said, "The idea that space used to be thought to serve the common good of science is gone. Now space is a place for nations to compete for global hegemony."
Pali reiterated what Markron said before, saying that the French had no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are in no way engaged in an arms race, but it is my duty to fully identify the threats we may face... "
Pali retraced the surveillance of a French-Italian military satellite in 2017.
She said, "Sneeping" was a Russian satellite.
The Russians deny it.
Pali said that France would soon have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and locking in the back of those unfriendly moves.
According to the French press, the reason France sought to establish a space force was because United States President Donald Trump asked the United States Department of Defense last February to draft a bill for the establishment of the Tai Air Force.
Trump signed the Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the establishment of the sixth largest United States army, the Tai Air Force.
Some experts are concerned that these American initiatives have accelerated the militarization of American space and could trigger a new arms race in space.

The shared accommodation market was reported to have been warming since March - the new medium network
The "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as "the Report" ), recently released by the National Information Centre for Sharing Economic Research, has shown a 72.1 per cent decline in the share accommodation market in China in the first five months of 2020, as a result of the epidemic.
However, the shared accommodation market has been warming since March, and the market turnover, the volume of orders and the number of receptions have gradually recovered.
"Reports" show that the volume of trade in the shared accommodation market has declined significantly, partly because of a sharp drop in demand for travelling accommodation under the control of the epidemic, a sharp decline in the number of orders, a 65 per cent decline in the total number of orders over the previous five months and a 63 per cent decline in the number of recipients over the same period; on the other hand, the weakness of demand has also led to a more marked decline in overnight prices, with an average of 16 per cent decline in the average overnight price over the previous five months.
However, in March, April, the market turnover ring increased by 78 per cent, 199 per cent, 35 per cent in May; the order number ring increased by 141 per cent, 152 per cent, 50 per cent; and the receiving underring increased by 81 per cent, 112 per cent, 28 per cent, respectively.
The report notes that the shared accommodation industry has developed well in the long term, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In response, the Deputy Director of the Centre for the Sharing of Economic Research of the National Information Centre in Feng Xia stated to the Journalist of Workmen that the development of shared accommodation required stronger policy support, on the one hand, through better implementation of pre-existing policies, further strengthening of policy coherence and a focus on creating a better business environment, and, on the other hand, greater policy guidance and support from a wide range of sources, such as stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism accommodation services, innovative service delivery and strengthening government-platform business cooperation.

On July 26, China's famous vascular surgery centre, Shanghai Hae-Hae Hospital, Naval Medical University, signed a contract with the Xiamen University-affiliated Xiaoshan Hospital for vascular surgery to set up a collaboration centre to promote communication between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, particularly in the field of aortic acute diseases.
According to Nakayama Hospital, after the formal collaboration of the vascular surgeons of the two hospitals, remote consultations will be conducted, treatment programmes will be developed with the real-time online consultations of the Changhai Hospital, skills development will be selected, weekly joint surgical exchanges will be conducted, teaching rooms will be conducted, etc., and, in complex cases, experts in Changhai will be invited to operate in the hospital, depending on the patient ' s needs, so that the southwest Chinese patients will benefit from the best medical resources available in the country.
The two hospitals will also work together on innovative surgical research, aorta disease and early screening, etc.
A workshop on the aorta, organized by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by the Nakayama Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University, was held in Xiamen on the same day.
At the same meeting, the two recognized hospitals held a signing ceremony for the collaboration centre for angiology and announced the formation of a collaboration unit to improve the treatment of angio-surgery-related diseases in the south-west of Guan.
The vascular Surgery of Shanghai Hospital is the only vascular Surgery Institute in the army and the only clinical centre for vascular system diseases in Shanghai City, as well as the first major national vascular Surgery programme, leading the establishment of the Specialized Committee on Intra-Atovasculars of the Chinese Medical Doctors ' Association, which is the top team with deep in-house insinuation.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Angiology and Surgery at Nakayama Hospital, Xiamen University, gave an interview with the media.
The Xiaoshan Central Hospital is the first independent vascular surgeon in Fujian province, with a long-term commitment to treating aorta and peri-vascular diseases, and in 2018 was approved for the construction of a provincial clinical priority specialist.
In the treatment of aorta diseases, in addition to mesosphere aneurysm and aorta, there is considerable experience in the treatment of aneurysm in emergency cases.
" From the history of development, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the surgery performed by the Xiamen Hospital, affiliated to Xiamen University, we have been very exceptional in the region, and we have set up a collaboration centre which, in addition to the aorta, has the potential to carry out deep medical, pedagogical and scientific cooperation in the treatment of diseases such as the lower limb arteries, the carotid arteries, etc. ... "
Professor Feng Wei, Deputy Director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said...
Chinashan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract in 2018 for the digestion of the internal medicine "Li Moo Sheng Medical Clinic".
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of the Institute ' s vascular surgery, in an interview with a Chinese-new network journalist, said that the Institute ' s vascular surgery had also been in contact with the Changhai Hospital for a long time, and that the two hospitals had formally formed a collaboration unit to bring the two sides together to the new stage.
He said that the Institute would regularly invite experts from Shanghai to exchange surgical techniques, study rooms, discussion of difficult cases, etc., and further remote consultations, which were currently planned once a week; in addition, the Unit would send personnel for refresher exchanges to enhance the development and development of the academic workforce.
At the meeting, journalists learned that vascular disease was the leading cause of death in China, and that the aorta was the main artery for all organs of the human body, moving from the heart to the whole body, with an important role to play.
The occurrence of an aorta disease is often accompanied by high risks, high mortality rates and the difficulty of treatment, with the thickest part of the aorta having a diameter of up to 4 cm. Once an vascular tumor is formed, there is a breakdown, or an endocrine rupture produces a membrane, it causes haemorrhage, which is dangerous.
In recent years, as the lifestyle of people has changed and the pace of life has accelerated, China has become the world ' s largest high blood pressure, with an increasing number of aortic diseases. Today, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases has been reduced, accelerated and efficient.
Doctors can "variate" the blood flow by punctuating from their thighs and putting it in a rack in the aorta so as to avoid the impact of an aneurysm or a ruptured lacuna and achieve good therapeutic effects, some of which require even a local anesthesia.
The symposium invited more than a dozen national experts to discuss new advances in the treatment of aorta diseases and to conduct cutting-edge technical training and challenge case discussions in the form of a conference salon.
At the meeting, journalists learned that, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is now developing in a modest, rapid and efficient way.

Cheng Mangau's three-thousand tunnels are open on 26th.
It's got to be on the ground.
The new lines are approximately 818 km long, designed at a speed of 350 km/hour, and approximately 184 km long in Chongqing.
Of these, the Chonzhou-Ziangyang Sector became operational early on 1 December 2019, and Chongqing Sector is stepping up its construction.
The 26-day-long-long tri-gorge tunnel is a full-line control project for Cheng Wan, located on the border between Chongqing City and Wushan County. It is approximately 18.9 km long and buried at a maximum depth of 890 metres.
The tunnel began construction in February 2017 and became fully operational on 26 July 2020.
According to the Royal Army, the director of the design of the Chinese Iron II School Engineering Group of China, Cheng Wan Gao Tunnel, the company limited in responsibility for the exploration of the design, the geological conditions of the location of the San Gorge Tunnel are very complex, facing the risks of rock solubleness, mud pouring water, large-scale oscillation of soft rock, high-risk tunnels of level I, which are extremely difficult to design and construct.
" In the course of the construction of the project, we have adopted special designs for over 30 types of soluble holes, using geologic survey methods, object exploration methods and extra-front drilling techniques, such as the design of a 24-metre-long bridge to cross a long vertical length of more than 10 metres in the tunnel and a large soluble hole of more than 55 metres in depth to avoid a tunnel sinking ... " The Royal Army says.
According to the construction side ' s Central Iron Tunnel Department, construction of the tunnel was carried out by means of a combination of decomposition, the construction of cross-choles, slurry and water, the reinforcement of the tunnel structure and the construction of a sewage treatment station, both to ensure orderly engineering progress and to avoid damage to the water bodies of the three canyons, while successfully overcoming adverse geological problems such as a 7-kilometre soft rock deformation, with a maximum daily influx of 157,000 cubic metres of mud pouring water.
The completion of the entire railway line will make it important for the south-west of the country to have access to China, the north-east and the north-east to improve the capacity and quality of the north-east rail link, improve the layout of the regional road network, speed up the development and urbanization of tourism resources along the routes, promote the development of regional coordination and promote the implementation of the Western Great Development Strategy.
Experts say it's unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the United States census for the allocation of seats in the House.
A number of civil rights organizations and several United States cities and counties have filed complaints against the United States federal Government alleging that attempts by the Trump Presidency to exclude undocumented immigrants from the United States census are unworkable and unconstitutional.
The United States census will determine the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union executive attorney Sarah Brannon said to the American voice, "It's not gonna work."
She went on to say that Trump called for the determination of the citizenship of the persons to be surveyed in the census to be difficult and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties organization, Joint Business, filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging Trump ' s executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey, Georgia, have joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the lawsuit on Friday.
"The United States Constitution requires an accurate census of our population every 10 years. We have to take an accurate inventory of everyone living in Arlington County and not let this illegal attempt to scare people and reduce the number of our immigrant communities succeed."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
The Alabama Attorney General, Marshall, said that the executive order was a "win" for the state.
He said, "The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives of the States and the electoral college must be based on the number of inhabitants residing in the States and the number of residents legally residing in them. "
The United States Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week to regulate the submission by the United States Census Bureau's Secretary of Commerce, Ross, of data on the undocumented population in the census in order to allow the administration to exclude these undocumented populations from state census figures and to determine whether each state has increased or reduced or maintained the number of members of the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years in accordance with demographic changes.

Responding to push for industrial projects -- looking at the headlines -- Hunan Daily News -- on-line
The summer's Hunan, the heat waves.
And the enthusiasm unleashed by the Departmental Industry Project Building and Promotion of the Field Watch, built over the heat of the summer, inspired by the clear direction of the industry to the hero of the project.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects, training industries.
In the first half of the year, under the strong central leadership of the party, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the province insisted on a game of chess, dedicated to the prevention of the disease, two hard battles, and the industrial project was used as the "first hand" for the implementation of the Six-Step Six-Step Six.
From 1.9 per cent decline in GDP in the first quarter to 1.3 per cent growth in the first half of the year, the hard times, the hard work, it goes without saying.
On this highly valuable report card, industrial projects are the key underpinnings of the accelerated economic recovery of Hunan and the stability of development.
It's good. It's unreversible.
The construction of industrial projects must be carried out in a way that is both dynamic, aggressive, resourceful and adaptable to change.
Against the backdrop of the complexity and gravity of the current international situation, and in addition to the enormous effort to attract resources, it is necessary to study the new features of the current situation, to be more regular, to be more scientifically precise and to be better integrated into the new development landscape, which is dominated by the domestic and international cycles, which are mutually reinforcing.
Increased focus on upgrading industrial infrastructure.
In the first half of the year, not only did I start with a huge number of heavy-weight investment projects in new and emerging industries, with hopes, but also with more traditional advantage industries that accelerated the process of digitalization, intelligence and greening.
The Yooyang Oscon III Science Park project has adapted the existing production lines, leading to the creation of intelligent production lines for high-end printed circuit boards; the Hongnan Changde tobacco factory area is committed to the intellectual transformation of the modern plant, which is also a living picture of the "old tree's new germs" . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Increased focus on fostering new business models for the development of the new economy.
The sudden emergence of the new crown epidemic, which has led to a "clouds economy" that has inspired the potential of the digital economy and provided new opportunities for industrial change: in the first half of the year, we increased 12.6 per cent in the manufacturing of computers and office equipment and 12.6 per cent in the manufacturing of electronics and telecommunications equipment, 32.2 per cent in the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the limit, and 35.6 per cent in the online meals of catering enterprises.
In the midst of the crisis, new opportunities have been created in the context of the transformation process, with the active promotion of digital industrialization, the digitization of the industry and the integration of the digital economy and the real economy.
Increased focus on optimizing and stabilizing industrial chain supply chains.
Engineering machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two thirds of the supporting companies are out of the province and there is still room on the chain.
The strengthening of the industry chain thinking capture project involves not only sustained accumulation of headlines and technological breakthroughs at key points in the industry chain; it also needs to be nurtured at the local level so as to trigger chain chain reaction with a strong chain-up chain extension, promote a coordinated layout of relevant supporting industries, and accelerate the building of autonomous, secure and secure chain supply chains.
We're still in a good business environment.
All over the province, there's a lot of moves, new moves, real moves, to make the company's "deficit" trigger a "accelerated" of high-quality development; "shareholder-type" services for companies, policy compliance, compliance with the policy, resolution of the night...In the process of recovering the damage caused by the epidemic, there's a lot of "several ways" to look for short-term pains, living stories of what's at stake.
A focus on industry, nurturing industry, developing industry, solidly optimizing the business environment, must win the favor of more investors.
The wind is still on, but the state of the storm has become the norm in the construction of industry projects across the province to promote high-quality development.
At this critical time, it is important to learn from the spirit of the series of important instructions issued by Xi Jinping Secretary-General, to respond effectively to external uncertainties with certainty in his own work, and to keep up with the construction of industrial projects, to share passion and sweat, to ensure the successful completion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the full realization of a small and prosperous society.

The overall level of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature"
Journalist of the Economic Daily, China Economic Network, Lin Fing Chan
During the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, China has taken a concerted approach to the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of economic and social development. The situation has continued to improve. The steady economic recovery has been evident, employment and price performance, which are closely related to human life, have generally stabilized, and the Chinese economy has given up a temperature-based economic performance report.
In the first two months of this year, there was an increase in the unemployment rate.
In particular, in February, production operations in many enterprises were largely halted, demand for labour in enterprises was reduced, recruitment delays or cancellations were delayed and unemployment in urban surveys increased.
As the situation of disease prevention and control gradually improves, the entire productive life of society is being restored.
In keeping with the general thrust of the Party ' s middle-level work, the Party ' s central government has further intensified its macroeconomic policy strategizing, strengthened its employment priority policies in a comprehensive manner, and actively promoted the promotion of job stability and employment expansion.
We have stepped up our policies to secure jobs, set up a combination of "reduced and subsidized return" policies, phased out the contributions of the three social insurance units, allowed delays in the payment of social insurance contributions, expanded the return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises, benefited from a policy of retraining, subsidies for the inclusion of priority groups in enterprises, internship subsidies, etc.
With the poor implementation of stable employment policies, the demand for employment in enterprises has risen steadily, the employment situation has gradually improved, the urban unemployment rate has declined, and in June it was 5.7 per cent.
According to Zhang Yi, Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of the National Statistical Office, employment policies continued to work in the second quarter, with the return of formerly retired labour force due to the effects of the epidemic and an increase of around 10 percentage points in urban labour participation compared to February in June, close to last year ' s level in the same period.
The data show that total urban employment grew by more than 19 per cent in June compared to February, with most industries reaching pre-epidemiological levels; the average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices are the same for thousands of families.
In January of this year, the CPI increased by 5.4 per cent, reaching a new high for many years.
In February, the CPI showed a slight drop in the year-on-year increase, but it's still in Zone 5.
CPI is in a high position with both pre-spring consumer demand pull factors and spring staggered and same-year base factors.
However, the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly evident.
In January and February, there were logistical delays throughout the country, delays in the supply of supplies, increased costs of transportation of goods, and a marked increase in the price of some of the necessities of life caused by the accumulation and purchase of goods by some citizens.
In order to respond to the disruption of the price situation caused by the epidemic, the authorities have incorporated vital goods into emergency transport guarantees to ensure that they are transported smoothly.
The market supply of vegetable melon fruit is strongly secured by a range of policy initiatives.
In response to the rapid rise in the prices of pork at the beginning of the year, the Central Government introduced a policy of price stabilization, which was followed by rapid implementation in all regions, with a marked improvement in the supply of pork stocks, an orderly resumption of pig production and a gradual improvement in the order of production and distribution.
Since March, prices of pork have been falling continuously, and food prices have fallen back to 10.6 per cent year-on-year in May; in June, the prices of pork have risen slightly compared to the price of pork, as a result of a slowdown in the output of raw pigs, a decrease in imports and a recovery in demand for group consumption.
Seasonal variations in the prices of fresh food are evident, with an average increase of 3.4 per cent in the first half of the year.
As a result of the higher base of comparison over the same period last year, the price of fresh fruit continued to fall year-on-year, with an average decline of 13.3 per cent in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the population is effectively guaranteed and the economic and social situation is stable and orderly.
As transport logistics recover, local supply security increases and market supply and demand improves.
Beginning in March, the CPI ring declined for four months in a row, from 4.3 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in June, and the price level has generally recovered flat.
In the second half of the year, prices will continue to remain moderate and overall inflationary pressures will remain low, but they will continue to contribute to the restoration of productive order in the context of the normalization of disease control.
Effectively respond to food, floods in agricultural staples such as vegetables and vegetables, natural disasters such as droughts, strengthening market regulation, and determinedly combating the hoarding of quirks and destabilizing market order such as price increases.

Today, the opening ceremony of the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival and the first Red Cultural Industry Fair is held in Sasayama.
On the occasion of the opening of the Red Tourism Culture Festival by the Provincial Council Standing Committee, the Minister of Communication of the Provincial Council, Zhang Hongsen, the Vice-Governor, U Guiying, made a statement.
The Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival has successfully held 16 sessions and is a well-known national red tour brand.
The festival was co-sponsored by the Department of Communication of the Provincial Council, the Provincial Department of Culture and Tourism and the Municipality of the City Council.
Goi Ying said that this event was important for the implementation of the important instructions of Xi Jinping General Secretary "to use the red resources, build on the red tradition, transmit the red genes" and further capture my provincial red tourism development, promote the revival of the Brunei market, and bring the Red Force together to build a rich, beautiful, happy new lake south.
The promotion of the red culture, the transmission of the red spirit, the stimulation of cultural consumption and the promotion of the quality of the Hunan Brigade will certainly play a more active role.
At the opening ceremony, the two events, "Red-and-Red-Dance" and "Red-Dance" and "Red-and-Dance" were launched simultaneously.
During the festival, there will also be a marketing and contracting ceremony for the Triad Industry Project, the Red Tourist Forum and the Red Education Training Seminar, the Red Wisdom Brigade Experience Fair and the sharing of new technologies, and events such as "Single Waters, Cultures and Roots" and "Hunnan Hills Invigorations".
During the opening ceremony, the leaders and guests of Zhang Hongseng, Wu Kwai Ying and others visited the site of the first Red Industry Fair in Beijing and watched the "China has made a Mao Zedong" scene.
As an artist, communication is very important to me.
Through my work of art, I try to make it clear that human beings are not separated from nature, but that everything is connected.
I went to Antarctica about 10 years ago for the first time, and I saw the iceberg for the first time.
I'm afraid.
My heart is beating fast, my head is dizzy, trying to understand what's in front of me.
I can only find it strange that this is a snowflake covered in another snowflake, formed year after year.
The icebergs are formed when they break apart from the glaciers or from the ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They interact with their surroundings and their circumstances in a clear way.
Some of the icebergs refuse to compromise and stick to the end, while others can't stand a burst of passion.
When you look at the icebergs, it's easy to think that they're all isolated, they're independent, they're single, they're more like how we humans feel about ourselves sometimes.
But it's more than that.
As the iceberg melts, I breathe into its ancient smell.
As the iceberg melts, it releases mineral-rich fresh water that feeds everything.
I started filming these icebergs as if I were filming the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that at these individual moments the icebergs existed in that way but would never exist again.
When they melt, it's not death; it's not an end, it's a continuation of the path to life.
I've filmed icebergs, some of which are very young -- thousands of years old.
Some ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last picture I want to show you is an iceberg that I filmed on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
It's a very rare opportunity for everyone to actually witness an iceberg roll.
So that's what it's all about.
You can see a boat on the left.
It's a boat about 15 feet.
I want you to look at the shape of the iceberg, and it's deformed on the water.
Here you see it rolls, the boat moves to the other side, and a man stands there.
It's an average size Greenland iceberg.
It's about 120 feet high or 40 meters high.
This video was taken in real time.
Like this iceberg, they show you different aspects of your personality.
Thank you.
(applause)

Mardi Gras.
On July 26th, China's new network Qinghai Hainan called "The Flower Room" on Qinghai Lake: "Sweet" with goods to help farmers increase their harvest.
Author, Hu Guilong, Pan Yu Jie
"On the shores of the summer Qinghai lake, with golden flowers, bees flying, high elevations, great day and night temperatures, low air pollution, strong light breeds the most tenacity and generous bees, creating high activity, high proteins, nutritional values, low sugar and low lipid characteristics. "
On 26 June, the Deputy Director of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous State Industrial and Information Authority of Qinghai Province, Zhang Jian-hoon, stated that
On that day, a live delivery of the Qinghai Pilgrim Pulmonary Helper bee product was held on the shores of Lake Qinghai, where representatives of the Chinese Bee Products Association and entrepreneurs and bee farmers gathered to promote the Qinghai bee product, selling a total of almost 10,000 bottles of the Qinghai Plateau bee magma on the line and carrying a total cargo of nearly 3.8 million yuan.

According to the information received, this live delivery was made possible by a network of Beijing-based knob chains, fast-handed, well-known domestic beehive retail companies, such as Bae, live broadcasts, power-market platforms, the promotion of business-plus bee farmers-grower exchanges, and the continued distribution of the Qinghai Plasma Consumables to consumers via online and offline channels, with companies expected to make a total profit of nearly $5.28 million a year.
In response, the President of the Cheyenne Beehives Corporation in Beijing, Hône, said, "It's worth it," which would increase the visibility of the Qinghai bee product, attract more consumers to it, like not adding a pure natural bee product, and drive the bee farmers to increase their harvest."
At present, the company has entered into a production cooperation strategic agreement with the Qinghai Cloud Bee Industries Ltd., the Qinghai Flower Bees and Bees Co-operatives, to jointly promote the growth of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
It's a Qinghai lake.
In the spring, the way the bee farmers "go after the nectar" was blocked, many of them died of missed flowers and lack of food, and the income of the bee farmers was severely affected.
"As a year goes by, the beesmen travel long distances from Yunnan and Sichuan northwards to the northwest, and they have been living and staying in the same place.
As businesses, we have a responsibility to help them ... "
According to Guna.
"Bees are environmental scouts, and highly contaminated areas can't survive. " The Managing Director of the Chinese Bee Products Association, Zhao Xiaochuan, introduced that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in preserving plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the quality of crops, especially in widely grown and poorly managed areas.
Research data show that pollination increases the production of oilseeds by 15% - around 30%.
The Chinese Bee Products Association's Managing Vice-President Zhao Xiaochuan (right) introduced Qing Hae-bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits of bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves, and the bee industry has great potential for human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, which has been poorly known ... "
Zhao Xiaochuan said...
Today, the number of beekeepers is decreasing, and there are many poor households that have been unable to move beyond the year to enter the stock cooperatives in bee boxes.
"The State has financial support, we contact technical staff to help guide, bee farmers lack knowledge and judgment about the market environment, and it requires the help and coordination of the Government, enterprises and industry associations to open up the market. "
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I want you to pay more attention in the future to help the bee-keeping community, "Shonna says, "Our bee products are also screened and regulated in strict accordance with national standards, guaranteeing quality and protecting consumer rights while helping the bee farmers."
As a result of the continuing rains, since 22 July, the mudslide following the landslides in the mid-level group of Fort Six village in Chongqing Wulong district has broken apart, causing extensive slide-shifting and deformation, completely blocking the river, forming 13 metres of water in front of the dam, and estimating a reservoir capacity of about 550,000 cubic metres of water.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, Chongqing Maritime Department decided to impose temporary traffic controls on the waters from the Yangtze boundary pallet to the Soyuz Beach.
According to Chongqing Meteorological and Hydrological Department monitoring, heavy rains, heavy rains in some parts of the Mid-West and North-East areas of Chongqing have been widespread since 25 years.
On the evening of 26th, the river dam station will be at its highest water level and its highest water level will be near the alert level.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, Chongqing Maritime Department decided to impose temporary traffic controls on the waters from the Yangtze boundary pallet to the Soyuz Beach ...
Following an emergency meeting between the Chongqing City Office and meteorological, hydro, hydrological and other departments and units, the Chongqing City Anti-Drought Command decided to release early warning information on river flood level III and initiate emergency response on level IV.
The Chongqing City Anti-Drought Command requires that all relevant units in the districts of Chongqing north, Shaping Dam, Xuannan, Wulong and Chongqing pay high attention to rainwater conditions, particularly the Yangtze, Ka Mahang and Uang Water Changes, to conduct early analysis and findings, to issue early warnings, to strengthen the duty of patrols, to evacuate people in threatened areas with determination and determination, to mobilize emergency relief teams and supplies in a timely and efficient manner, and to avoid mass deaths and injuries.
The Minister Counsellor of the Vietnamese Embassy in Laos, Zheng Chin, attended the ceremony together with representatives of the Lao Buddhist Association of Viet Nam, the General Lao Vietnamese Association, the Vientiane Province Government and the Lao Association of Veterans.
The ceremony was held in a solemn and solemn atmosphere, and representatives continued to pay tribute to the heroes, to their great service and to their special ties of solidarity.
In his address, Minister Counsellor Jung said that this was an opportunity for the old Vietnamese and Lao people to remember the two countries ' great revolution and to express their gratitude together for the sacrifices they made for their independence and freedom, as well as a good opportunity for the two peoples to recall that the two countries worked together to fight against the common enemy, for national independence, for national unity, for the development of the country and for the consolidation of relations between the two countries.
Seventy-four years ago, on January 23, 1946, 28 fighters of the Viet Nam Battle Coalition died bravely in the attack on the Phonehe stronghold.
This attack was won as a historic victory between the two countries in the early stages of their struggle for a national liberation revolution.
Ms. Chung stressed that the peoples of the two countries will always bear in mind the sacrifices made in the cause of the struggle for national liberation, while stressing that the young regions of the two countries will continue to build on the heroic and strong traditions of their elders and make their due contribution to the continuation of old relations and to the prosperity of the two countries.
Milestone crossing!
International Milan unlocked the 3,000th Aichaka competition - China New Network
In the early morning hours of July 26th, Beijing time, a landmark battle was fought in the Hikata tradition of Milan International.
According to the Italian media, the spot against Genoa is the 3,000th A.A.A. in the history of the Milan international team, and the Blue Black Army is the first team to unlock this milestone.
Since the re-establishment of the League in 1929, Milan International has been the only team that has never been absent, and the only team that has never been downgraded.
According to Italian media reports, the international match between Milan and Genoa is the 3000th game of the Blue Black Army.
In this landmark battle, the three-games of the International Milan Tournament won Genoa.
This time, Luca Kume, he's playing twice, and he's playing a ball for Sanchez, who's back on the field.
From the start, the race entered the international rhythm of Milan, and the assault finally turned into a goal in the 34th minute.
Billage left pass. Lucacu's halfway through the ball.
The 82nd minute of international Milan's battle, after Moses' right-hand break, the Sanchez middle-barrel hit the hand; the final stage before Lukacu finished two degrees of mackerel and counter-attacked Brozovic with a long-range straight-off, and Lukaku broke into the restricted area and ran over Romero, and then pushed the blanks to score a score of 3:0.
The International Milan Tournament has won Genoa at 3:0, the counter-Atlanta has risen to 2, and the lead sheep, Uventus 4, in a multi-challenge scenario, still holds the hope of winning the championship.
So, of the 3,000 A.A.A. competitions across nearly 90 miles, Milan International won 1,489 of them, flattened 834 and lost 677 with 49.6%.
During that time, the team scored 5038, threw 3102, and the field hit 1.68.
The Blue Black Army won the League 18 times and never downgraded.
The statement stated that the drone had fallen inside Lebanese territory while on mission near the Blue Line on the border between Israel and Lebanon.
The statement doesn't mention the cause of the drone crash.
Israeli media reported that the drone could have crashed due to a malfunction.
The Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, Gantz, reportedly stated during his visit to northern Israel that afternoon that Israel would continue to take action against Syria and Lebanon in order to ensure its security interests.
Israel has long viewed Hezbollah in Lebanon as a major security threat and accused the Iranian side of sending weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon through the Syrian land corridor, and there is tension near the Israeli-Lebanese border.
Israel has repeatedly carried out air strikes against targets in Syria on the grounds of attacking the organization.

"The Winner" by Liu Yunlong, the director of Yin Fei, Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Conghua, Li Li and others, landed on July 16th at 7:30 p.m. in Guangdong City.
The play tells of the secret conspiracy of the Japanese army to kill the head of the Japanese operatives, in association with the Soviet operatives of the Chinese Communist Underground at the Japanese police station.
"Success" is based on historical adaptations, taken from Soviet military archives that have been sealed for years.
During the Moscow defense war, the Red Army of the Soviet Union was in the sharpest direction of the Far East, when the Japanese Kandong Army's "North Intruder" considered it to be a good thing to do and wanted to go out.
In order to escape the enemy's danger, the Communist Republic of China has joined forces with the Soviet intelligence services to carry out the Mudangura project.
According to this historical background, the famous screenwriter, Dengwon, has been grazed for a number of times to make the play goofy.
Liu Yunlong is the producer and lead man in winning this time.
In the play, he plays Tang Fei, the head of the Criminal Section of the Lim River Police Department, a happy, even a bit of a grumpy stun police officer, and the true identity of a member of the CCP Underground.
Tsai is the Chief of the Lim River Security Bureau, who is deeply appreciated by Japan's superior Fukuhara, and has a delicate relationship with Tang Fei.
Su Qing has tried a lot of different roles in recent years, ranging from Luo Man in "We Are Young in those Years" to Queen in the "Emergency Strike" which impressed the audience and was recognized for acting.
This time, Su-Qing and Liu Yun-Long are the first partners, and the stun police chief is well equipped with the Xiaomei police station.
In addition to the two main actors, the winner is Liang Cong Hua, Li Li, Chan Bo, Lehan, Shin Soo and so forth, and the old drama is one of the things to watch.
It's also known that the winnings were very well produced, and that the crews crossed Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Liaoning 3 provinces, almost 2,000 kilometers, took the view.
In an effort to restore the city's predispositions during the era of the Northeast Japanese law, the team of art and props went to work day and night, carefully grinding out every detail of the scene and the props, making the scene in the middle of the scene very good and historic.
Floods in two western governorates of Yemen resulted in the death of 16 people - China New Network
Xinhua Society, Kuwait City, 26 July, news from Sana'a: According to local Yemeni media reports on 26 July, Al-Hoodaida and Al-Hajj governorates in western Yemen were hit by heavy rains and floods have killed at least 16 people in the last 48 hours.
It was reported that 13 people were killed as a result of the rains in Hodeda province and 3 people were killed in the neighbouring Hadj province.
In addition, dozens of houses were destroyed by flooding in the northern part of Hodeda and in the southern part of Hadj province, and parts of roads and agricultural lands were damaged to varying degrees.
The military conflict that lasted several years led to the near collapse of Yemen’s health system.
According to United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs statistics, since 2017, more than 1 million people have been infected with cholera in Yemen and more than 2,000 have died.
Yemeni medical institutions fear that continued flooding will lead to a resurgence of the cholera epidemic.

Liao William, Dong-woo, Yang Xin-won, Wang Xue-bong and the other leading online films, "The Jedi Strike" are officially on display in Aichi.
The film tells the story of the fallen boxer, Venus, returning to the ring and fighting for dignity, and shows a bloodbathing journey of dreams.
The whole story of the Thai boxing, which was driven by Thailand as its main case, was framed by traditional Chinese cultural values, whether Venus was determined to fight fake fists for his master or, later, to revive his efforts to fight for dignity, with the support of friends and lovers, showing men's desire and love for their families and dreams in China's traditional culture.
Together with the classic Hollywood sports story model and the strong combination of the Chinese and Thai professional teams, the Jedi strike not only has the effect of internationalization, but will also have a different kind of audience.
At the same time, the Jedi are showing a lot of Thai boxing and training scenes, intense and bloody.
In the video, Xiaoqiang, a game designer from Dong Woo, helped Venus, who was played by Liao Williams, to return to the ring and take off his cinnamon, combined the new and curious high-tech with a hot-blooded competition, and also displayed the "difficultness" of Linus and the same goal of brotherhood.
In addition, the glimmer of love between Venus and Crystal is moving, and both the silent support for Venus and the firm commitment of Venus to Crystal have brought to the audience the "told-hairedness" of Venus and added a lot of feelings to this fallen champion.

The National Technical Committee for Standardization of Information Security, the China Consumers ' Association, the China Internet Association, the China Cyberspace Safety Association and relevant professional assessment bodies participated in the meeting.
The App Working Group on the Management of Personal Information for Violations of the Law uses the "App Personal Information Report" ("App's Personal Information Report"), a dedicated web site (pip.tc260.org.cn) to receive reports and questions from a wide range of Internet users regarding the use of personal information for violations of the law.
At the same time, a wide range of online users can also report and report offences to platforms such as the Centre for Reporting Illegal and Unsound Information (www.12377.cn), the Centre for Reporting Information on Malpractice and Waste (www.12321.cn), etc.
Mr. Chang, you're a journalist.
We're starting a new mix of green land, and Shanghai funds are transferring 17.5% of the shares.
Economic Watch, journalist Xian Xian, on July 26, green land holdings (600606.SH) issued "an indicative announcement that state-owned shareholders are to agree on the transfer of part of the company's shares and a relic by means of a public call to the recipient party".
The announcement indicates that, in order to further deepen the reform of State-owned enterprises, optimize the restructuring of State-owned investments, and improve the structure of green land equity, the shares to be transferred by means of a public call for a partial transfer of shares of the company held by the upper Haitians (hereinafter referred to as "Upper Haiti") Ltd. and Shanghai City (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai City") Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai") Ltd.) are not more than 17.5 per cent of the total stock of the green land.
The price of this proposed transfer of shares is not less than the average arithmetical value of the daily weighted average price for the first 30 trading days (27 July 2020) of the indicative announcement day; the value of net assets per share audited by a company in the last fiscal year.
At present, new strategic investors in greenfields remain open and, according to the announcement, it is estimated that 17.5 per cent of the shares transferred in this mix of greenfields will have to be paid in the order of $14 billion.
It is worth noting that after the transfer of the shares has been completed, it is expected that the green land will remain free of controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but that the structure of control may change significantly.
Since its creation, green land holdings have undergone a number of institutional reforms: 1992-1997, operating under a purely State-owned system in accordance with market-based rules; 1997-2013, establishing and continuously improving State-owned holdings and the shareholding of workers; 2013-2015, introducing strategic investors to form a mixed system of mixed ownership of State-owned and non-public capital; and 2015-present, overall listing as a public company.
The current mix-up scheme in the Greenlands is similar to Grail, which in December 2019 took over 15 per cent of the shares of the Glycerine Electric (000651.SZ) at $41,662 million with the title of High Captorship, which, after completing the mix-up, implemented a high-level incentive scheme, modern business management such as an uncontrollable human structure.
Shanghai is the capital of the Shanghai National Investment Commission, the Chairman of the Green Land Holdings Corporation, and the President, Zhang Yu Liang, who said that the green land initiative was an important step towards comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises and the acceleration of a new phase of reform of State-owned enterprises, in accordance with the central requirements of the Shanghai Party. The new approach to reform, which is tailored to suit local conditions, has been fully demonstrated by introducing new strategic shareholders to listed companies, supporting enterprises to further marketize, promote business management freedom and accelerate the full release of the dynamic of reform.
Xinhua Network, the first trip across the country to launch a train tour.
On 25 July, at 12.20 p.m., Xinhua, Xinhua Xinhua State (journalist Li Ping), more than 200 Shanghai tourists travelling on the D771 drive successfully arrived in Lang Creek, Zhejiang Province, the first cross-provincial tour of the country since the resumption of the Department of Culture and Tourism's inter-provincial (district, city) team tour on 14 July.
It is located in the middle and west of Zhejiang city of Lang Creek, where there are so many attractions, such as the Gossip Girl Villages, the Chang Rivers, and the village of Chijing Gu, where more than 200 Shanghai tourists will take a look at them in two days and a night.
Li Li, Deputy General Manager of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (GATT) Ltd., said that under the latest policy, the company was focusing on cross-provincial requirements, first contacted Langbrook City, and carefully launched the products Shanghai to Lang Creek and Summer Adventure II, which were sold out less than a week after the launch.
Aunt Sun from Shanghai said she hasn't been out this year because of the epidemic.
"I've been at home for a long time, and as soon as I see a team tour, I'll share the news with my friends, and I've never been to Lang Creek before, and I look forward to this trip..." Aunt Sun says.
It is known that in September of last year, Lang Creek City signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Shanghai Railway International Tourism (GATT) Ltd. on the "Ride on High Steel River" project, which plans to launch 12 trips of high-speed tourism from Jiang Quan to Lang Creek within one year.
I hit myself in the face?
It's too early to go back to work in the states of the White House.
It's too early to get back to work in the White House.
On July 23, local time, 4 million cases of new coronary pneumonia were diagnosed in the United States, accounting for 30 per cent of global cases.
For months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked the states to resume their studies until recently, when he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear a mask in public, and his advisors called some state governments prematurely.
On 22 February, at a press conference, the White House presidential adviser, Karen Conway, stated that some state governments had failed to comply with the criteria for re-entry and had prematurely reopened bars and other places.
Conway also mentioned earlier rumours that the President had "absolute power" to decide on the resumption of work in the states.
"The President is a federalist who believes in state autonomy. "
She defended Trump.
However, the rumour in Conway was given by Trump himself at a White House outbreak briefing on April 13th.
This self-punishment is being mocked by the Internet as "rew history".
Karen Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called the Governor of Michigan Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a stoppage.
Trump wants to press back to work so he can hold a rally.
This isn't the first time Karen Conway's been in a dispute.
On April 15, Conway, in an interview with Fox News, said, "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to have understood "19" as a version number, which is being narrated by the internet: read newspapers without common sense!
Recently, we've seen the impact of cyberattacks on the business world.
The data leaks from companies like Morgan Chase, Yahoo, Jidoodo and Taggett have caused hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars in losses.
One more attack like this, the world economy will collapse.
The public sphere is not immune.
From 2012 to 2014, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management experienced a very serious data leak.
Security clearances and fingerprints were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also have heard that some government-funded hackers, using stolen data, are trying to influence election results in some countries.
The most recent two were the large-scale theft of data by the German Bundestag, and the theft of e-mails by the National Democratic Council of the United States.
Cyberthreats have affected our democratic process.
And there's a growing trend.
The more computer technology is developed, the more vulnerable the means we use to protect the data.
In particular, a new computer technology, called quantum computers, uses natural microparticles to significantly increase computer computing capabilities.
It's so powerful that it can decipher many of the encryption systems we use today.
So are we hopeless?
Shouldn't we start packing electronic survival equipment to meet the coming end of data?
I don't think it's that far.
Quantum computers just exist in the lab, and it's gonna take years before they actually work.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in encryption.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of security communications.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we unlocked new skills that created quantum effects that did not exist in nature.
The idea of using the basic laws of physics to advance encryption is exciting.
Today, some of the selected companies and laboratories, including mine, have advanced this technology to the practical application stage.
That's right.
We're going to use quantum against quantum.
How do you do that?
First, let's get a quick look at the encrypted world.
You need a briefcase, you have some important documents to give to your good friend, James Bond, lock it up and keep it safe.
Because these materials are top secret, we're going to use a super-advanced briefcase.
It has a special password lock, and once it's locked, it converts the contents of the file to random numbers.
So you just put the file in, lock it, and this time it's converted to random numbers, and you send this briefcase to James.
When the briefcase isn't delivered, you call him and tell him the code.
Once he's got the briefcase, entered the password, and the document was deciphered, it was perfect, you managed to deliver an encrypted message to James Bond.
A fun example, but it's three points of encryption.
Passwords -- we call them encryption keys.
You can imagine it as a code.
The phone call that told James the code.
We call it a key transfer.
This will ensure that the key is safely delivered to the designated location.
And the locks used to encrypt and decipher the files.
We call it the encryption algorithm.
By the key, it converts the contents of the document to random numbers.
A good algorithm can do this, and it's hard to crack a password without a secret key.
The significance of algorithms is that if someone gets the briefcase, opens it, doesn't have the key, doesn't know the encryption algorithm, they can't read the document.
It's just random numbers.
Most of the security systems rely on secure key transmissions, passing the key to the right place.
However, the rapidly growing computing power jeopardizes many of the keys that we're currently using.
By way of example, we're now applying a very extensive system -- RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 4 billion years to crack a 426-digit RSA key.
And in 1994, just 17 years later, the code was broken.
As computers get stronger, so do the passwords we need.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096-bit passwords.
As you can see, the battle between the cryptographers and the dissectors is ongoing, and they all want to beat each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers will quickly decipher complex mathematical algorithms that form the basis of the encryption systems we use today.
In fact, the quantum computer will turn our safe castle into a card house that's a touchdown.
We'll try to protect our castle.
There have been a number of research institutions in recent years that have been working on how to use quantum effects to enhance encryption.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the three priorities of encryption, high-quality keys, secure key transfers and strong algorithms.
However, advances in science and engineering have jeopardized two of these priorities.
The first thing to hit is the key.
Random numbers form the basis of the key.
But today, they're not really random anymore.
At present, we generate secret keys based on random digital frequencies, generated by software, which we call false random numbers.
Programmatic or mathematically generated numbers, there's always some, maybe not so obvious patterns in it.
The lower the randomness of these numbers, or, in terms of terminology, the lower they contain, the easier they are to predict.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked in creative ways.
They shoot the tiger machine for a while, then analyze it.
Cybercriminals use reverse engineering to create a fake random digital generator behind the wheel.
So they have a good chance of predicting the turn of the wheel, making a lot of money.
The key is also not safe.
Having a real random digital generator is important for generating a secure password.
For years, researchers have been trying to create a real random digital generator.
But most of the designs are either not random enough, not fast enough, or hard to reuse.
But the world of quantum is really random.
It's very important to take advantage of this real randomity.
Devices capable of measuring quantum effects can generate a series of random digital streams very quickly.
There's no way that the casino crime we just talked about could ever happen.
Several universities and companies from around the world are concentrating on making real random digital generators.
In my company, our quantum random digital generator was born in a two-metre-wide optical table.
Then we narrow it down to a box size.
By today, it can be placed on a PCI card, in an ordinary computer.
This is the fastest speed in the world, the real random digital generator.
By measuring the quantum effect, it produces a billion random numbers per second.
Today has been widely used around the world to improve the safety of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
But even with a real random digital generator, we're facing the second major cyber security threat: that's the safe transmission of the key.
The current key transfer technology is unable to counter quantum computers.
And the quantum solution to this problem, called Quantum key distribution, QKD, uses a basic quantum mechanics counterintuitive properties.
Observing the behavior of microparticles changes the particles.
Let me give you an example.
Let's think about it again, and give the code to James Bond.
But this time, we don't call him, and we use the quantum effect, and we carry this code with a bunch of lasers, and we pass it through the normal fiber optics to James.
Let's assume that Dr. Nobbs wants the code.
Fortunately, in trying to intercept this quantum key, Dr. Nobbs will leave electronic fingerprints, which you and James can see.
That way the intercepted key will be destroyed.
And the key left to protect the data is powerful.
Because this safety mechanism is based on physics fundamentals, quantum computers, or any future supercomputer, it's impossible to crack it.
My team and I are working with many top universities and the defense department to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of safety products.
The Internet of things heralds the advent of a highly interconnected era, where 25-30 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020.
If our society is to function properly in the networked world, then trust in these interconnected systems is essential.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important in building this trust, and it will ensure that we fully enjoy these amazing innovations, the innovations that make our lives rich and rich.
Thank you.

The 3-year-olds were hit in the playground, and after they got paid, did they have a case?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Rule of Law Journal by Wang Si-seok
The playground's been smashed, and the kids will be fined and they'll sue the school.
□ Correspondent, Zhao Yifan
Wen, 3 years old, accidentally got hit in the head by Chan from the softball team while he was playing in a college playground.
After Chen's compensation, Mr. Man, his father, as his legal representative, brought the school before the court, asking for an apology for the school in which the performance took place, and for the payment of medical expenses, moral damages, etc., amounting to $20,000.
Recently, the People ' s Court of Haidian District of Beijing, after considering the case, held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, had fulfilled its duty to ensure proper safety and security, and that Chen Xiao had paid compensation, and decided to dismiss the plaintiff ' s claim.
Mr. Wen complained that during his summer vacation in 2019, he was playing with Man on the school playground while the softball team was training in the playground.
To avoid the risks involved, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents are operating in the safe zone designated by the softball team.
But then the softball teamman Chen left during the pitch, causing the softball to fly across the fence to the above-mentioned safe zone and hit Little Man in the back of his head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with a head wound.
In Mr. Mann ' s view, the school grounds facilities did not meet the relevant safety requirements and did not effectively manage the team and associated facilities ...
The school ' s fault, which led to the above-mentioned incident, caused great physical and psychological suffering and caused greater suffering to the family, is legally responsible.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a safety net on the playground and posted regulations, training notices, informing it of the need to be safe from the playground and to be mindful of its own safety, and that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the school had failed in its duty of safety and security, and refused to accept compensation.
The court considered that the university in question was open to the public free of charge and that, while the school had an obligation to ensure the safety and security of the playground, such an obligation of security only required a general duty of care ...
At the time of the incident, the school had set up a safety net on the playground, had fulfilled its proper safety and security obligations, and Chen was also compensated for the medical expenses, transportation costs, etc., in accordance with the earlier compensation agreement, for over 2,000 dollars, and the parties agreed to resolve the dispute once and for all.
Later on, the parents reiterated their claim for school compensation, and the court ruled against all the plaintiffs ' claims.
Neither of the parties appealed the sentence, which is now in force.
Under article 37 of our Tort Liability Act, schools, as administrators of public places, have an obligation to ensure their safety and security; in the event of damage to others resulting from the actions of a third person, the third person bears responsibility for the tort, while the public places administrator, who fails to meet the obligation of security, bears the corresponding additional liability ...
The judge stated that since it was most likely, as the administrator of a public place, to have an understanding of the actual situation in the place, to foresee possible risks and damage, and thus to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of the loss or to mitigate the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the damage at the lowest cost, the law provided for the corresponding obligation of guarantees for the performance of social activities ...
In the present case, the duty to ensure the safety and security of schools should be compatible with the social activities they engage in, in particular, the adoption of basic security measures and the duty to inform of hidden risks ...
Nor is it appropriate in judicial practice to impose excessive safety and security obligations on administrators of public places.
If the school has adopted a protective net and is under an obligation to inform, it may be held that the school is free of fault and is not legally liable ...
In addition, in the case of third-party abuse, even if the administrator of a public place, such as a school, fails to fulfil his duty of security, his liability is supplemented by damages, and under the recently promulgated Civil Code, the administrator may recover from the third person after assuming additional liability ...
Therefore, in such an incident, the victim should not extend the scope of the claim after having received compensation from the direct infringer ...
Today I want to show you the way we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be able to assemble themselves, replicate and repair themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I think is the current state of manufacturing, and then we're going to compare it to some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years, 500,000 to millions of parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million types of protein that can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, and we can copy DNA with three billion bases in about an hour.
That's the complexity of our natural systems, but they're very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, more complicated than anything we can build.
They're more efficient in terms of energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can fix themselves to live a long life.
There's something really interesting about natural systems.
If we can convert it into our built environment, then we can build things in a way that has great potential.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we're going to build -- our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of our building operations.
And then we need programmed parts that can accept this sequence and that can be folded or reconstructed.
We need some energy to activate, so that we can fold these parts according to procedure.
We're gonna need some kind of error redundancy to make sure that what we're building is what we want.
So I'm going to show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I are working on to achieve this self-assembly future.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale re-engineering robots -- 8 feet, 12 feet long protein.
They're embedded in electromechanical equipment, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold, and you need to decode it into a series of angles -- negative 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, negative 0 degrees, negative 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees -- something like that; a series of angles, or a shift, that can be passed over by wires.
Each unit gets its own message -- for example, negative 120. It rotates, checks if it rotates and passes the sequence to its neighbors.
There are many distinguished scientists, engineers, designers working on this project.
I think this project really reveals: Is it really scalable?
I mean, it cost thousands of dollars a lot of people to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next question is to look at passiveness, or passively try to make reorganization programmed.
But it went one step further, and it tried to actually calculate.
Basically embedded in the basic building module of most calculations, the digital logic door, directly into the parts.
It's with the Feast.
Each door to be used for calculation has a quadruple, with two inputes.
One of them is input from the user, just like you're building bricks.
The other is the input of a brick that was put in front of us.
Then it gives a three-dimensional output.
That means users build bricks the way they want them to.
It's calculated on the basis of what you've done and your instructions.
Now it starts moving in three dimensions -- up or down.
On the left, the input of [1,1] is equal to zero output, meaning down.
On the right, the input of [0,0] is one output, meaning up.
So the real implication is that our structure now contains the blueprints that we want to build.
So the information about what you want to build is all embedded in it.
That means we have some kind of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directed replication, because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If there's a mistake, you can replace a part.
All local information is embedded in it and you're told how to fix it.
So you have something that can climb, read it out and one by one output.
It's directly embedded; no external command input.
The last project that I'm going to show is called the eccentric chain, which is probably the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we're seeing right now.
It's refractable and programmed to make it a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a chain of elements.
Each element is identical, and they're biased.
Each chain, or each element, wants to turn to the right or to the left.
If you're going to assemble a chain, you need to program it.
Tell each unit to turn left or right.
When you shake this chain, it folds up and programming any structure that you code for -- so in this case, a spiral, a fire situation, two connected cubes.
Basically, you can program in three-dimensional space -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- the chain is completely passive.
What future does this have for us?
I think it tells us about these possibilities of self-assembly, self-replication and self-repair in our physical structures, our buildings and our machines.
There's new programming in these parts.
From which you get a new possibility to calculate.
We'll have room to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, our bridges, our machines, all the bricks can actually be calculated.
What amazing parallel and distributed computing capabilities and new design possibilities.
It's an exciting potential.
I think these projects that I've shown you are just a small step forward, if we achieve these new technologies for a new self-assembly world.
Thank you.

In the normal state of epidemic control, the enthusiasm of people for sports and fitness rises.
With the gradual liberalization of trans-provincial tourism operations, the tourism market is about to recover.
Fujian Province resumed its trans-provincial tourism business from 21 July, and the first weekend after opening, the gate of the capital destination reached its peak.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are a lot of tourists arriving at Xiamen on weekends.
The Xiamen railway station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer, while the airport traffic is dominated by students, tourism and family visits.
The tourist market has been warming up, with 440 flights per day at Xiamen Airport in July, and domestic flights have resumed to 80% of pre-infested flights.
Airlines encrypt the air speeds of major cities like Xiamen, Beijing, Kunming and Xian, and took over the recovered tourist market.
At present, Xiamen's travel agencies are on-line with a series of summer-time inter-provincial products, and the team travels are dominated by outdoor spots.
With regard to railway stations, summer passenger traffic peaks at the airport, additional personnel have been deployed in areas where people can easily gather, such as on-duty counters, security corridors, and Fujian has also upgraded the eight-line health code optimally to achieve health data sharing and mutual recognition with the 31 provinces and contribute to an orderly revival of the tourism market.
Can Liu Qingyun "dismant" ? Xinhuanet?
The bomb disposal specialist 2 recently announced that it will be shown on December 24th as the first film scheduled for his first birthday.
The second part is still the director, Liu Dewar, and the lead actor, with a whole new story.
The addition of the second nuclear bomb element has also made the challenge for the bomb-dismantling expert even more difficult, as it is predicted that a few glimpses of the scenes have been stunned, a huge explosion of mushroom clouds, a fire-spilled airport.
Three years ago, a bomb-dismantling expert, made by the original teamman, won a five-by-one boxing champion and seven nominations for the Hong Kong Film and Image Award, and Qiu Litao Liu Dwa became the golden partner of the audience.
This bomb-detonator 2 is another hope that the Ace team will get a new spark.
Bomb Specialist 2 tells a whole new story: the former bomb cracker, Pan Jae Feng, fainted at the scene of the explosion and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to turn to his best friend, Tung Chewn, who was also a bomb-dismantling expert.
The female inspector, who was eager to solve the case, was also involved in Pan's ex-girlfriend's Pon-Ling.
Still an expert in bomb demolition, but the schematic premonition senses the complexity of Andy Lau's new role: broken legs, wearing prostheses, being hunted by Liu Qingyun, who was also an expert in bomb demolition, and being directed by former girlfriend Nini.
What was the relationship between the three, what did Andy Lau do at the Honolulu Hotel, what kind of cases were involved in, what was the twist of his career as a bomb cracker?
It is understood that the main feature of the film is the field viewing of Hong Kong ' s world landmark architecture, which, together with the top special effects production team, has a shocking impact on the real vision.

On July 26th, China-News Network integrated Russian satellite network reports that July 26th is the day of the Russian Navy, and that the main parade to celebrate the day of the Navy is held in St. Petersburg and Karangstad.
Russian President Putin, the Supreme Commander of the Russian Armed Forces, arrived in Kalashta for a celebration, where 15 ships and submarines were inspected.
On July 28, 2019, local time, a great military parade was held in St. Petersburg, Russia, to celebrate the naval festival.
It was reported that Putin congratulated the Navy officers on the day and sailed by boat from the Gulf of Finland next to the ships that were about to take part in the naval parade, and then inspected the troops at the subjective altar.
Putin states that the Russian naval fleet is equipped with state-of-the-art ships and special equipment and that the level of equipment is constantly increasing.
Putin said on the Russian Navy Day parade: "The Russian naval fleet is equipped with high-precision ships, strategic dive cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, aircraft such as the latest aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment. "
On June 24th, local time, Russia marked the 75th anniversary of the victory of the Patriotic War with a parade at the Red Field.
He also indicated that the Russian naval fleet would gain unique advantages through digitization and effective defence.
According to reports, the main naval parade to celebrate the Russian Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Karangstad with the participation of 46 ships, including the frigate "Captain Kassatov", the large anti-submarine vessel "Captain Kurakov" and the large landing ships, small missile ships, frigates, submarines, etc.
Among them, a series of ships performed a static display near the Winter Palace Bridge in St. Petersburg, the most striking of which was the cloned Russian first battleship, the Boltava, at the beginning of the eighteenth century.
In order to avoid the spread of the new coronary virus, only local residents and special guests will be able to enter Karangstad during the Navy parade this year.
The last Sunday of July of every year is Russian Navy Day.
The founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, Yang Hong, passed away and was 86 years old - Middle New Network
On 26 July, the Beijing Elephant Choir (journalist Liu ) issued an obituary by the founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, a prominent Chinese commander, a music educator, and a lifelong academic member of the Central Academy of Music. Professor Yang Hong-Yong, a professor in the Department of Command, died on 26 July 2020 at 13.55 p.m. in Beijing and was 86 years old.
Photo from Beijing Singer Network.
Yang Hong was born in 1934, from Jiang Sunanking, and loved music since childhood.
Commander of Nanjing People's Radio in 1951, accepted to the Shanghai East Division Music Department in autumn 1951, where he studied from Professor Yang Karen and the German commanding man, Schizman, learned the tunes of the former Soviet expert Alzamanov and repeated them.
He was taught at the Faculty of Music of the Beijing Teacher Training College in 1958, and was transferred to the Department of Composing at the Central School of Music in 1973.
Yang Hong founded the Beijing Philharmonic in 1983.
For more than 30 years, with the purpose of love and devotion, he led this choir around the world and won dozens of prizes in important competitions at home and abroad.
He directed the performances of more than 30 groups, including the Central Band, the Central Nation Dance Group, the Orient Dance Group and the Shanghai Choir, and held a number of symphony and choir concerts.
The books are "Song Training", "Song Training", "Two Songs Writing", "Children's Songs" (up and down) and the papers "The Sound Level Layout of Orchestra" and translated "The Singer Method" and "The Voice of Debosi".
Do you know how many blooming plants there are?
There are 250,000 -- at least we know so much -- of the 250,000 blooming plants.
And flowers are a problem.
It's really hard to grow plants.
It takes a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why is it bothering you so much?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, sex.
I know what's in your head when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important -- there are many other ways in which plants can reproduce.
It can be in the form of branches; it can breed in the same sex; it can pollinate in the same strain.
But they do need to transmit their genes and mix them with other genes, so that they can be ecological.
That's how evolution works.
Now the way the plant conveys this message is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a scan electron microscope that can see this.
How many blooming plants have many different kinds of pollen.
It's actually quite useful for forensics and so on.
Most of the pollen that causes us to get pollen fever comes from the plants that use the wind to spread pollen, which is a very inefficient process, and that's why pollen always comes into our noses.
Because most of them are abandoned, hoping that the reproductive cells contained in pollen, male reproductive cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All the grass, which means all the grain, and most of the trees spread pollen through the wind.
But most species actually use insects to do this process, and it's smarter in a way, because it doesn't take too much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen, moving pollen directly where it is needed.
Obviously, we've noticed the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship, whether it's a bird or a bee, and they get a reward, usually for nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship leads to amazing adaptive changes -- red skirt moths are a beautiful adaptive change.
Plants also reap, and Tianxai spread pollen elsewhere.
Plants evolve, create landing runways everywhere, bees may be lost in them.
Some of the plants look like other insect markers.
These are lilies, very clever, so when the unknowing insect falls on it, the pollen is turned around, with a lot of pollen on its back, so that it can follow the insects to other plants.
There's an orchid that looks like a jaw. In a way, it does; it forces insects to climb over, get pollen and bring pollen somewhere else.
Orchids: There are at least 20,000 orchids -- a variety of amazing things.
They have all kinds of tricks.
They have to try and attract pollinators to help them in this process.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it was studied by Darwin and given a wonderful prediction when he saw this orchid, can see that there's a long nectar coming down from the orchid.
And basically what insects have to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it stabs the mouthpiece into the middle of it and knows the nectar all the way down to get the nectar.
Darwin said, "Look at this flower, I guess something has evolved with it."
No doubt, it's an insect.
I mean, usually it's all rolled up, but it stretches out, and it looks like this.
Now, imagine if nectar is so valuable that it's expensive for plants to produce and attract many pollinators, then, as in human sex, people may start to cheat on each other.
They might say, "I have some nectar. Do you want to pick up some?"
It's a plant.
This plant is loved by insects in South Africa, and they have evolved long mouthpieces to get nectar at the bottom.
It's a copycat.
This plant mimics the former.
There's a fly with a mouthpiece that doesn't get any nectar from the impostor, because the impostor doesn't give it any nectar.
So not only did the fly not get nectar from a fake plant, but -- if you look very closely at the top of your head, you'll see that there's some pollen that's going to spread to other plants, if there's no botanist to come and stick it to a blue card.
This lies are spread all over the plant kingdom.
This flower with the black spots: they may look like black spots to us, but I tell you, for the male insects of the right species, it looks like two very, very sexy females.
When an insect arrives and lands on it, it immerses itself in pollen, which, of course, will be taken to other plants, and if you look at the image that every family should have of scanning the electron microscope, you can see actually there are patterns, three-dimensional patterns.
It even makes insects feel comfortable, and it looks good.
These electron microscopic images -- this is an orchid disguised as an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures for our eyes, and insects may sense very, very different textures.
This orchid has evolved to mimic the surface of the metallic light that some beetles see in their beetles.
Under the scanning electron microscope, you can see this surface -- it's very different from the other surfaces we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even if we look like insects.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful and magical thing.
It's called the Black Rock.
I think it's tricky sometimes.
For the type of bee, it looks like another very aggressive bee, and it'll fly over and hit it many, many times with its head, try to drive it away, of course, and it'll get pollen on it.
The other thing it does is this plant mimics another orchid rich in food that insects love.
But there's nothing.
So it's cheating on two levels -- incredible.
And what we see is Elan, the fragrant part.
I actually smelled it before.
These flowers don't really have to be so beautiful.
They give out wonderful fragrances that attract any interested insect.
This flower doesn't smell good.
This flower actually smells really bad. Again, this is evolution, and it looks like rotting meat.
So the fly likes it.
Flies fly in and pollinate them.
This is a white star, also known as a dead horse.
I don't know what the dead horse smells like, but this flower may smell very much like it.
It's horrible.
The green fly can't help it.
Fly into it, all the way into it.
They lay eggs on them, and they think it's a nice piece of rotting meat, and they don't realize that there's no eggs here, and they're gonna die here, but this plant will benefit, because the hard hair is loose, the flies are gone, pollinating to another flower -- it's amazing.
It's a potato plant, a taro, aloma, in this country called the long-term grass.
I shot this last week in Dosset.
This guy's heating up about 15 degrees higher than the ambient temperature -- incredible.
If you look inside it, behind the veal is something that's kind of like a dam, and flies are attracted to heat -- it's a boiling volatile chemical substance, bugs -- and they're trapped under this container.
They drink sweet nectar and then they get a little sticky.
At night, they're covered with pollen, sprayed down by them, and then the hard hair we see up there is gone so that the little worms can escape -- it's incredible.
If you think it's incredible, this one's my favorite.
It's a green velvet.
People from Brazil should know about this plant.
It's the most amazing thing.
It's got about an inch long.
It has the ability, as far as I know, to have no other plant, and when it blooms -- it's a boar in the middle -- for about two days, it produces a degree of metabolic change, some like mammals.
And there's no starch, it's plant food, it's got very brown fat stuff that burns it at the speed of burning fat, and it's metabolic, and it's going at the speed of a kitten.
By weight ratio, it's twice the energy output of the hummingbird -- absolutely amazing.
And he did something unusual.
Not only will it warm up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Fahrenheit, two days, but it will keep the temperature constant.
One of them is a temperature-regulating mechanism for keeping the temperature constant.
Why are you doing this? I heard you asking.
Now you don't know that some beetles like to mate at this temperature.
They drill in, they're covered in pollen.
Plants fill them with pollen, let them leave and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing to do.
Now we think most pollinators are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, because butterflies and birds are similar to us, and we think that they can very well see red.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue, see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and UV, and they see all kinds of dark UV.
There's some color behind this.
"What if we could see those colors?" I heard you asking.
Yes, we can see.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert lilies, half a day, in Dosset.
As we can see, these are little yellow flowers, all over the place.
It looks like this in visible light.
If it looks that way to remove the red.
Most bees don't feel red.
And then I put an UV filter in front of my camera, and at a certain UV frequency, I exposed it for a long time, and I got this picture.
It's like a real amazing target.
Now we don't know what the bees are seeing, and when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We can't know what's going on here, whether it's insects, or in the brain of other humans.
But the contrast seems to be that way, from the background.
This is another small flower -- in different UV frequency zones, different filters to match different pollinators.
It looks like it.
In order to avoid you thinking that all the yellow flowers have this attribute -- there was no damage to the flowers during the shooting; just stick it on the tripod, not take it off -- under the ultraviolet light, look at this.
It's the basis for sunscreen, because sunscreen works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe some of the chemicals are useful.
In the end, it was a night's aroma that was sent to me by Bjorn Rorslett of Norway -- an amazing hidden pattern.
I like this way of hiding.
I think it's poetic. These pictures are taken in an ultraviolet filter, which is used primarily by astronomers to film Venus -- actually, the clouds on Venus.
This is the main use of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and procreation, which is the word of flowers.
And just as the flowers have spent so much energy trying to attract pollinators to their invitations, they have somehow succeeded in making us believe that there's a lot of them, and that when we are born and we die, we send flowers to each other, especially at weddings, and when you think about it, at this moment, the genetic material moves from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

On 26 July, the Chongqing City Development and Reform Committee of Chongqing (journalist Liu Xian) released a message stating that the city had, to date, retired 4404 fishermen, or 42.54 per cent of the total number of fishermen involved.
According to a 53-year-old Chinese news reporter, he's been fishing in Dragon Creek, shaking a boat with his father since the age of 11, going up to Chongqing Ping, going down to Longevity, leaving home for 10 and a half days, and living with his family.
Since 1997, however, as the rural population has gradually moved towards the town, the population of the town of El País has grown and the environmental pollution has increased.
Paper mills, chemical plants, farms, and contamination of river water have been built along the Dragon Creek.
By 2007, in 2008, Dragon Creek turned into a stinking ditch.
"The scales caught are black, and they're black after they've been cut out."
Li Dynasty said it's getting harder to fish after the river's polluted.
There's a lot of local effort to deal with the pollution of the Dragon Creek, including drifting, rivering, water resources management, etc.
Li Dynasty also moved from fishing to production and became a member of the river patrol to protect aquatic resources.
Since 1 January 2020, a complete ban on fishing has been in effect in Chongqing City ' s aquatic and related waters in the main city.
According to data from the Chongqing Municipal Development Reform Commission, there have been a cumulative number of 3403 fishing vessels in Chongqing and 4,643 fishing vessels in which the agreement has been signed, representing 63.3 per cent and 86.3 per cent of the three-year total, respectively.
4404 fishermen, or 42.54 per cent of the total number involved.
Of the 4404 persons who have returned, 4267 have been employed, representing 96.89 per cent of the total number of retired fishermen.
Old-age insurance covers 2,691 persons, representing 61.10 per cent of the retired fishermen.
As a next step, Chongqing City will carry out intensive and specialized clean-up operations, speed up the clean-up of the Yangtze River River Line, complete a new survey of the river drains and conduct corresponding remediation operations, complete the rehabilitation of the "triphosphorous" (for phosphorous mines, phosphorists and phosphorus quartz reservoirs), clean-up of small hydropower, promote the reforestation of both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the illegal marinas in the Yangtze River River, conduct illegal sand harvesting, and further promote the ban on retreats in the Yangtze basin.
Increased Israeli surveillance of recurrent outbreaks - new and emerging networks
2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: The Daily Light by Wang Si-seok
Increased Israeli surveillance of recurrent outbreaks of disease
In the early days of the new crown pneumonia outbreak, Israel's anti-control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on anti-control measures and the recent marked increase in the number of new coronary pneumonia cases in Israel, the Israeli Government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the control of the epidemic.
On 28 February, the first case of new coronary pneumonia was diagnosed on the mainland of Israel, prompting the closure of all ports of entry and exit, the suspension of non-essential trades, the conversion of schools to online instruction, restrictions on public transport and non-essential social activities, the closure of municipalities with severe epidemics, joint military and police defence initiatives, etc.
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results, and by mid-May new cases of coronary pneumonia were diagnosed in Israel on a single day.
With the outbreak under control, Israel ' s anti-control measures have been completely lifted, and the number of new confirmed cases of pneumonia has gradually rebounded since June.
Especially after July, the spread of the epidemic has accelerated.
In recent days, Israel had more than 1,500 new cases per day for eight days, with 916 new cases as at 25 July.
As at 25 July, Israel had 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid resurgence of the epidemic, the Israeli Government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen its control.
On 6 July, after 30,000 cases were diagnosed, the Israeli Government closed the gym, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and other public entertainment venues, and introduced a public transport restrictions policy, under which the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On 17th, the Government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of the "Segregation City" on weekends, providing for the implementation of the "Segregation City" between 5 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Fridays and Sundays.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping malls, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition galleries, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, during all dates and periods, more than 10 people are prohibited from gathering, gymnasiums, studios, etc. are closed, restaurants and cafés are prohibited from serving canteens, and take-out services are permitted only.
At the same time, the Israeli population has not paid sufficient attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and has not been able to join forces with the Government in the fight against the epidemic.
In the wake of repeated Israeli epidemics, many people marched on the streets to protest against government measures to influence their economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, believing that the disease policy affected the economy.
On the night of 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the residence of Prime Minister Netanyahu in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu ' s ban on restaurants and the failure to compensate for preventive measures such as coffee shop canteens.
In addition, many people do not wear masks during outdoor activities, maintain two metres of safe social distance, etc., and many people wear masks on their chins or hang them on their wrists in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing them.
During the recurrence of the epidemic, schools were the worst affected by the spread of the new coronary virus, and a recent visit to the kindergarten by journalists found that kindergarten teachers and students were not wearing masks as required by the Government, nor were they keeping two metres of safe social distance from each other and burying a large number of teachers and students with the virus.
According to Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the National Security Council's expert advisory mission to combat the epidemic, Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation", noting that the current measures taken by Israel to prevent and control the epidemic are insufficient and that all recreational and recreational venues and summer schools should be closed in order to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman stated that Israel lacked an overall plan to combat the epidemic and that Parliament and government departments should move away from their respective interests as soon as possible and reach agreement on the fight against the epidemic, with clear steps to include relevant restrictions in different sectors.
The newspaper Tel Aviv, on July 25th, is a Tel Aviv journalist, Wang Chang.
Ning Xia Kuwon, a farmer like Wu Feng Fong, is no longer a friend of his, two in a car, from their home 20 miles away, to the Liang Yun cultural compound.
Despite these two years of incompetence, the 77-year-old Dai Tinfu is counting on "a trick and a trick to get here."
It's an invisible yard in the plains of the city, and unlike the usual farmyards, there's always a popular Qin cavity in the courtyard, and there's a lot of leather shows, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavities, browsing plays, etc.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began to plan for a cultural compound.
With the Liang Yun cultural compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich.
The reporter hasn't entered the Liang Yun cultural compound and the tune of the Qin cavity has spread.
The Qin contest is being played by the neighboring village's village, Priscilla.
She's been in love with Qin since childhood, and now she's got a reputation on the ground, and she'll come to the cultural complex to perform for the folks.
Recently, Priscilla played live on the Internet.
"There's a stage for more people to see their own performances. It's a very happy thing."
On the stage, the singers look one at the other, the players sing one at a time, but they're not losing their enthusiasm, though they're amateurs.
Like the pristine style of the farmhouse, outside the Qin cavity, the roots of the "grass" art and non-relict culture of the Qin cultural compound came to the surface.
The compound also contains over 300 items of agricultural tools, traditional and handmade tiles, paper clippings, embroidery, leather shadow, etc.
Leung Yun led reporters into the courtyard where they showed his collection of old objects, old wine pots, trichords, swirling cars, etc.
Why would a common farmer build a cultural compound?
"Skin movies are my family art, and I've been studying it since I was 15. "
The Liang Yun Cultural Complex was established in 2012 as the first rural "Intangible Cultural Heritage Museum" in Ningxia and as a model compound for the conservation of Intangible Cultural Heritage in sequestered cities.
In addition to the Liang Yun cultural compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in the former prefectures of the town of sequester, including over 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as the Shen Jia cultural compound, Wang Yonghong cultural compound, Yangroon cultural compound, etc., covering the towns and streets of the former district, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grass-roots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the people and satisfying their spiritual needs.
"As life grows better and better, traditional culture cannot be left behind. "

The 40th episode of "The Winner" will land on the Beijing Watch from July 16th.
Winning is based on real history, based on the Soviet military archives that have been in the dust for many years, the first time ever.
The famous actor, Liu Yunlong, challenged a popular "stutter agent" in the play.
In recent years, the famous dramas of "the masker" and "the kite" all prove the vitality of the quirky type of play.
In contrast to the war scenes of the past, "winner" looks at the world, stretching the story beyond the background of the Soviet Far East.
In the context of the final phase of the 1944 war against Japan, it tells the story of the Chinese Communist Party secret intelligence staff Tang Fei, who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Chinese Underground Party Committee for Lin Ha Province and the head of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carried out the "Mudanura" plot of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In a lot of quirks, the lead man, as a top spy, is handsome, intelligent, mature and perfect.
But in Liu Yunlong's opinion, such a person is not fit to spy, "The spy is the kind of person who can't find it in the crowd, and if he's out there, he's the one who's very handsome, and everyone has to look after you, he can't hide." There's a line in kite, "I'll forget that I'm a nationalist if you don't come after me."
So in "winning," Liu Yunlong was so determined to design his character, Tang Fei, as a "stutter agent" with a sense of joy.
The other side of Winning is supported by the Japanese Fuwon and Li Li's Chief of Police, Fong Shibao.
One north and two north, adding a lot of great talent to the whole show.
Director Yin Fei used the word "joke" to describe Li Li's and Liu Yunlong's rival scenes in the play, "It's definitely a drama, they're both very close, and it's very powerful for me. They're often `tangled up', like we write half a page length, and if I don't stop filming, they can keep on doing it."
It's not only from the point of view, but also from the point of view of the audience, that when the actors are in the role and keep their characters in the position of their characters, they're not only able to shape the role, but they're more likely to view it.
In the play, you can also see the faces familiar in many of Willow's charades, when the kite was famous, and the famous Mountain F4 gathered three in the winning game.
He played Song Hsiao An and Zhao Jane's Huo and Liu Myung Yang, and this time Tang Fei's right arm.
Directed by Infei, "These two men have no faults, but in that time, the environment was flowing."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We have to have a feeling that people around me must have good and bad, bad people are enemies, but we have to develop them, and our teams will grow."
The end of the play for both of them was also carefully designed, and he was confident that a satisfactory answer would be given to the audience.

Four students of the Inner Mongolia flag were drowned.
On the evening of July 26th, the Chinese-News Network called for electricity (journalist Lee Aiping), journalists learned from the government of the city of Ah Yong of Hulenbel in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region that four local students had been killed by drowning.
On 24 July, at 1550 hours, the Public Security Bureau of the flag of Along was informed that six junior high school students had drowned.
After the police were picked up, the local civilian police first went to the scene, rescued two students on the spot, and then the local emergency authorities, the water authorities and so forth arrived and took part in the rescue.
According to reports, the rescue scene involved more than 80 members of the Public Security Civil Police, the police, the fire department, the medical staff and others. Three rubber boats were sent to search the surrounding waters on an ongoing basis, and specialized rescue teams were hired to arrive at the site to conduct underwater searches through sonar detection.
Journalists learned that the first student was found on 25 July at 6.40 p.m., the second student was found on 25 July at 11.30 p.m., the third student was found on 25 July at 12.40 p.m. and the last student was found on 25 July at 13.34 p.m. The four men were found to have no signs of life after having landed at the 120th Emergency Centre.
Officially, the drowning was a wake-up call for the whole community.
At present, local authorities are compiling some knowledge about drowning prevention, hoping that the tragedy will not happen again.
Xinhua Society Hong Kong on July 25th, the Director of Finance and Treasury of the HKSAR Government, Xu Jung-woo, said that Hong Kong ' s financial markets remained active and functioning in an orderly manner.
He is optimistic about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Jung-woo, at an online seminar organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Congregation Canada) on 24 (Toronto Time), said that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation due to the "repair of windwaves" and the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
Hong Kong dollar exchange rates are stable and in favour of strong exchange guarantee levels.
The banking system showed no clear signs of financial outflows; on the contrary, more than $11 billion had been flowing since June.
Total bank deposits have also continued to increase over the past few months, with a series of open equity fund-raising activities in the stock market, which have been on the rise.
According to Xu Jung-woo, the new coronary pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong ' s fundamental advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has a number of advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and capital, and a simple low-tax system, which keeps Hong Kong at the forefront of international financial centres.
According to Xu Jung-woo, the HKSAR Government has set aside HK$6 billion from the Immunization Fund to create some 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering persons with different skills and qualifications.
In order to support the development of financial science and technology, the HKSAR Government has also launched the "One Thousand People's Scheme" to finance local financial technology companies, start-ups and other businesses with financial science and technology-related businesses to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talent and enrich Hong Kong's pool of financial science and technology talent.
Looking ahead, Jung-woo Xu is optimistic about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to use the advantages of Hong Kong and its status as an international financial centre, an international asset and wealth management centre and a global offshore renminbi business hub for development and investment in and around the Australasia Bay region of Hong Kong.
The newspaper "The Lancet" praises China's anti-epidemic efforts and encourages countries to learn from their experiences.
According to the Journal 25 of The Lancet, China, a country with 1.4 billion people similar to Europe or the United States of America, has effectively controlled the new crown epidemic at this stage without further widespread transmission and has largely controlled the epidemic in the country.
According to the article, over the past 10 years, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, which has made it much more prepared for the new crown than for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of that year.
According to the author, at the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially because the pathogens could not be identified.
When the new coronary virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and to share genome sequencing data with the international community on 11 January 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had articulated the clinical characteristics of the virus, warning the world of the threat of the new coronary virus through research papers published on the Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research and, in the event of a state of emergency, through close domestic cooperation, conducted very quickly and strictly. In May and July, respectively, the results of the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China were published on the Lancet.
China ' s experience has shown that it is important to invest in national health and research systems and to improve laboratory capabilities effectively.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are highly worthy of learning and learning.
Moreover, China ' s experience has shown that, on the basis of strong research, a strong high-level and decisive decision-making based on scientific evidence is necessary to bring the new crown epidemic under effective control.
The article stresses the need for Governments and their leaders to respect science, understand its value and act on it in the most socially beneficial manner ...
In the early days of the outbreak, the Chinese National Guard appointed three teams of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new coronary virus. Their recommendations provided the basis for the decision taken on 23 January by Wuhan to seal the city; when experts raised the need and urgency of building the quadrant hospital, the Government took the decision and implemented it quickly; and, at the same time, the broad participation of the community and the population made it possible to control the epidemic quickly and effectively.
The article concludes by highlighting the need for countries to strengthen global cooperation and joint responses to global health emergencies.

Former inspector of the Uhai City Council of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Platinum Sea, was expelled from the party.
On July 26, China Nobunaga reported that the Supervisory Board of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (INAMAC) had recently conducted an investigation into the serious disciplinary violations committed by the former inspector of the UGC, with the approval of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Board.
It has been found that the White Sea, as a leader of the party, has lost its idealistic convictions and has defied the principles of the party and has fought against the reformation of the party for its own self-interest; that it has a low organizational attitude, which has led to the transfer of jobs and the receipt of other people ' s belongings in the selection of its cadres; that it has suffered from economic greed, which has led to huge profits, the trading of power and money for the profit of the business; and that it has been corrupted, which has had a negative impact.
The platinum Sea constitutes a serious breach of political discipline, organized discipline, integrity and life discipline, constitutes an official offence and is suspected of bribery, corruption and corruption, and, after the party ' s eighteenth birthday, does not retreat, does not stop, is of a bad nature and is of a serious nature and should be dealt with seriously.
In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Regulations on Disciplinary Punishment of the Communist Party of China, the Standing Committee of the Disciplinary Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, having considered and reported to the Party Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for approval, decided to grant the platinum Sea a penalty for dismissal from the Party and to adjust the treatment to which it is entitled; to collect the proceeds of its disciplinary offences; to transfer the alleged crime to the Public Prosecution Service for review and prosecution in accordance with the law; and to transfer the property in question.
In the afternoon of 25 local time, a small plane hit the top floor of a multi-storey residential building in Wessel County, Northern Germany, causing three deaths.
A joint statement issued that evening by the Duisburg prosecution, the Wessel County Police Department and the Wessel City Fire Department stated that at about 1440 hours on the same day, a small aircraft crashed into a house on the penthouse of a multi-story residential building on Phiberskamp Street, Wessel County, killing three people.
It took off the same day from the city of Mar, Rull District, Northern Wehr, and then took off again after stopping at the airport in Wessel County, and then hit the residential building.
The identity of the deceased or two passengers on board a female household and a small plane that was hit in the house.
A two-year-old in the room was only slightly injured and was safely rescued.
The rest of the house wasn't injured in the accident, but the mood was still unsettling.
The scenes of the incident, reported by the German News Agency, showed that the house in which the accident took place had been smoked and that firefighters had put out the fire, and that the house had been severely damaged.
At present, the cause of the plane crash is unclear.
The "Rhine Post" quoted police reports that there were clues indicating that the plane had broken down before it hit the residential building.
According to the police, multiple parts of the crash plane were found in the area of the accident.
The German criminal police are working with the Duisburg prosecution, the German Federal Aviation Accident Investigation Agency, to investigate the cause of the accident.
The journalist learned from the Chinese Consulate General in Düsseldorf on the same day that it had contacted the local police and fire department and that none of the casualties had been found to be Chinese citizens.
Singapore ' s Ministry of Health announced on 26th day that, by 1200 hours on that day, there were 481 new confirmed cases in Singapore, with a cumulative 50369 confirmed cases; and 27 cumulative deaths.
The data show that of the new confirmed cases, 5 were local community cases, 4 were imported cases, and the rest were foreign workers living in special dormitories.
Singapore ' s Ministry of Health states that 98% of new confirmed cases are related to known infections ...
There are still 173 new coronary patients in hospital, most of them stable or improved, and no one is in intensive care.
In addition, 4,648 people are isolated in community facilities.
Among Singapore's new crown infections, foreign workers are the majority.
According to statistics, there are 200,000 foreign workers living in 43 dormitories dedicated to foreign workers in Singapore, and about 100,000 foreign workers living in other types of dormitories.
The Singapore Inter-Sectoral Working Group on Disease Control has recently indicated that the Singapore government is stepping up testing for the last few dormitories of foreign workers with high rates of new crown infection.
Upon completion of the testing of all specialized dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work, but they will still have to undergo a new crown test on a regular basis.
Da Ping's starring in the Golden Lord's Award - Xinhuanet.
On July 18th, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival published the list of the official selected films of the Golden Lord's Award.
Da Peng's first real-life film, "Happily Good" , was successfully included in the film festival's Golden Lord's Award, and the film's official launch of the first poster.
Posters, table charts.
The film "Happily" was the first realism by Da Peng director and his second connection to the Golden Prize.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who came back to his village in the northeast, hoping to make a film about his family in the middle of the year, with a series of accidents.
Family members gathered for the film, finished the last party.
In today's film poster, one of the members of this family — Wang Xiangxiang, sitting in the center of the picture smoking in the background of the black land of the Northeast in silver, the red light that Chinese must hang for their holidays.
As a symbol of joy, the reunified red lamphouse is a huge contrast to the shadowed king's blessing and seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement of this extended family relationship.
According to the information received, apart from the fact that the daughter of Uncle Wang is played by actor Liu Lui, the film's experimental audio-visual style, which breaks the boundaries between drama and reality, brings a new immersion experience to the audience.
According to director Da Peng, the creation of the "Happily Good" originated from the "Spirit of Heaven," during which the family suddenly changed its plans, and the life without a script was eventually recorded as a movie, but it released the power beyond design.
How does director Da Peng deal with this "behavior" and how can he continue to respond to the changes brought about by it?
There is no doubt that "good luck" is an experimental, almost universal, audio-visual style that transforms life in front of the camera into a movie, and that, wrapped in real images, the viewers will find themselves and their families from the family that the film presents, and as the film ends, a series of reflections will take place.
NEWS.GOV.MO: Information hotline statistics for new coronary virus response centres (08H00 of 25 July and 08H00 of 26 July)
From 08H00 on 25/07/20 to 08H00 on 26/07/2020, a search hotline for a new coronary virus infection response centre received 292 calls.

Barto Dracang post, long line Yu Wang and a soldier on duty.
At this average annual temperature of about a dozen degrees, a row of simple barracks is standing at the entrance of the mountain, the camp is not far away with a flag rising, and the soldiers are on duty in the wind every day, with regular patrols to higher altitude locations.
The warriors climb the steep slopes of the rocks and need both hands and feet.
It was late in July, when the grass was blooming in the low-lying areas, and only in the ditch behind the barracks was there a relatively dense green.
The soldiers who had been stationed at the post for six years said that this was their backyard, and that only in July and August of each year would we see grass slowly growing, and soon, all turned yellow and covered by snow.
It could take about nine hours to patrol on foot.
In the harsh highland environment, the soldiers who are stationed here are often accompanied by snow mountains and glaciers, and they regularly patrol the higher ends of the mountain.
Today, a patrol of eight soldiers, led by coach Liang Ye-Hin, took the patrol road again.
Each soldier weighs about 30 pounds, heading towards the target in the morning.
On the way, one of the warriors was renegade, and the comrades were in urgent care.
In addition to the patrol mission, the soldiers at the Bartoukang post have daily tactical and physical training.
The passage of time, the rising altitude, the decreasing oxygen content, and the constant overstretch of strength test the will of the patrolmen.
They gnawed their teeth, crossed a few landslide points, crossed several critical beaches.
It's lunchtime for the patrolmen, who bring their own dry food and sit at an altitude of over 5700 metres, with rain and snow and food for their strength.
The soldiers at Bartoukang are trained in tactics and physical abilities.
During the break, they play cards together, losers do push-ups, entertain and exercise.
After a short break in the cold, they climbed up to the target point of this patrol, took the flag out at the entrance of the mountain, solemnly vowed.
Behind them is Mount Mamarche, which is a few dozen kilometers away, and they are the safest guardians of the country's gates.
Beijing Consumption Season Restart - Xinhua Network
Beijing City relaunched its consumption season activities in accordance with the principle of "full reboot, focused, well-organized and well-organized".
On 26 July, 1.5 million coupons were issued, including 1 million off-line food coupons and 500,000 smart product coupons, which consumers could receive from the Tokyo APP.
The Deputy Director of the Beijing City Bureau of Commerce, Liu Mei Ying, presented at a media conference held in Beijing on the need to further reduce business allocation during the relaunching of the consumer season on the basis of the maintenance of the existing voucher card package subsidy.
Starting in early August, the current 1:1 ratio of government and business funding was adjusted to 2:1, for example, when consumers received a card package to the shop, and received a 120-dollar discount, of which the Government subsidized $60 and the business benefited $60; after the adjustment, the government subsidized $80 and the business benefited $40.
During the consumption season, three major operators will subsidize flows and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting 5G new capital and 5G new consumption in Beijing.
Chen Mo-bok says that Hong Kong's economy has been hit again by the epidemic, and that it's difficult to get along with each other.
On July 26, the Director of Finance of the Hong Kong Government of the Hong Kong SAR reported that Hong Kong had been hit by a new wave of neo-crowd pneumonia, as well as by commercial and economic activity that had seen a slight recovery.
The HKSAR Government once again calls on all large and small owners to reduce rents, to work with retail traders, and to work with small and medium-sized enterprises in times of hardship.
Chen Mo-po published an article on the Internet entitled "Stucky Way to Recovery".
He stated that the recent high number of cases of new coronary pneumonia diagnosis in Hong Kong and the critical situation have affected the lives of the population and affected the economy.
In the event of repeated outbreaks, the primary priority is to prevent cases from being imported and to treat and disrupt the transmission chain as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is under control, economic activity should be resumed in due course.
He noted that, in the face of a new outbreak, commercial exchanges and economic activity, which had been a bit of a recovery, had also been hit.
For the business community, social responsibility is no less important than the contract spirit, especially those groups that receive large government subsidies under the Employment Guarantee Scheme.
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong remained critical in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to have slowed slightly.
On the export side, he believes that Hong Kong's periphery is still critical.
According to Chen Maobo, Hong Kong's development history over the past decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
One winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I drove to work, I found the city covered in fog.
I drive through there almost every day, but this time it's unusual, and I've never seen anything like it before.
Johannesburg was famous for its unique beauty, but it was almost invisible that morning.
Soon I realized that what I saw was a severe haze caused by air pollution.
The contrast between that beautiful environment that I've known all my life and the skyline that's clouded by the fog, it's pouring in my heart.
I'm afraid it's very likely that the dark fog will swallow the colored sunset view of the past.
At that moment, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is I can't just stand by and watch.
The biggest challenge is that I don't know about environmental science, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm pretty sure that I can't code for air pollution.
What am I going to do with this?
I'm just a town boy.
In the next few years, I learned a very important lesson, and if we want a better future, we should all remember it.
Even if you're not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may imply solutions to problems in that area.
Sometimes you have a unique perspective that inspires unconventional thinking to shape the situation, but you need to be bold enough to try.
Only then will you know the results.
What I knew at the time was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution first, so I became a student again.
I did some basic research, and I quickly learned that atmospheric pollution is the greatest environmental health risk in the world.
World Health Organization data show that in 2012, almost 14 per cent of deaths worldwide were caused by atmospheric pollution in and around households, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
The annual mortality from atmospheric pollution is higher than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation, or deaths due to malnutrition among children, appear pale in the face of atmospheric pollution, while at the same time causing huge economic costs: according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, spending in 2013 exceeded $400 billion.
In my work, I'm looking for the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, to find useful ground and help us make better decisions.
And when I think about the problem of atmospheric pollution, how to deal with it, and it becomes clear, we need to find better ways to make better decisions, considering the magnitude of the problem, it's very necessary to work together.
So I decided to meet some people who work in this field.
I started a conversation with officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I called people who were completely strangers but involved.
The experience that I've been involved in has helped me to understand the problem more deeply.
And it helped me avoid the trap that people in my line of work sometimes fall into when they try to innovate: before they really know the problem, quickly adopt a technology.
I started thinking, what can I do to improve this situation?
I started to ask myself, how to effectively integrate my knowledge skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the professional skills of the people I contacted.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends, make projections to determine what might happen.
I'm sure my idea can be a realistic solution, but I'm also faced with uncertainty, and I can't guarantee it's going to work.
All I have is a specific set of engineer skills, the skills I get from my work, and, of course, for people who have been working in the field of atmospheric pollution for years, my skills are new.
I've come to realize that sometimes there's a new perspective, a new skill set, that leads to something extraordinary.
Our willpower and imagination is a beacon that tells us to cross the barrier and open a new chapter.
I've developed a deeper understanding of the problem of atmospheric pollution, and I've been looking for data on atmospheric pollution over the past 10 years, as well as weather data in and around Johannesburg, and I've been working with colleagues in South Africa and China to create an air quality resolution support system and upload it to the clouds.
This software allows analysis of historical and real-time data to reveal trends in pollution over time and space.
We then use new machine technology to predict future contamination a few days in advance.
That means residents can make better decisions about their daily journey and where their families live.
We can anticipate adverse pollution events, define the sources of severe pollution, and allow the authorities to direct their operations.
By supporting scenario planning, urban planners can make better decisions about how to expand infrastructure, such as housing in industrial areas.
We've built a pilot for that technology, run for 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
Our expectations have been validated, and the prediction data that we've shown and the data that we've collected on the ground have shown a close correlation.
Through our management, we have introduced the world ' s leading cutting-edge instrument to predict atmospheric mass, its resolution and correctness are unprecedented, allowing the city that I travelled to benefit from the recent winter morning. I said to myself, "There is something wrong, I have to do something."
So the point is, what if I didn't study the problem of atmospheric pollution in the first place?
What if I don't focus on the state of the country's environment, but rather on hoping that somewhere else, someone else, will be in charge of these things?
What I've learned from this is that it's important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequences of inaction when we're fully committed to a cause that we all believe in.
We shouldn't be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should inspire us to go further.
So wherever you are in the world, the next time you find out that some sort of innate curiosity of yours has been provoked, and it's about what you mean, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if it's not your field of expertise, ask yourself: why don't you try it?
Why don't you do your best, in your own way?
You might get the surprise.
Thank you.

The biggest earthquake in Taiwan's eastern sea this year - the new Chinese net.
On July 26th, the Chinese news agency Taipei had an earthquake of the Richter scale at 2052 hours on July 26th in the eastern sea of Taiwan, with a maximum seismic level 4 and a full-scale shock, the biggest earthquake this year.
Integrated Central, Central Times, ETtoday News Clouds, etc., Taiwan Meteorological Department reports that the earthquake struck 86.5 km south-east of the Illan county government, i.e., the eastern sea of Taiwan, with a depth of 53 km.
China's seismological network has determined the earthquake to be 5.5 degrees.
The biggest shocks across the country are: level 4 in Han Lian County, level 4 in Yilan County, district of Taidong, level 3 in Nanzhou County, county of Yunlin County, and levels 1 to 2 in other counties and municipalities.
According to the Taiwan Meteorological Department, the earthquake was the largest in the world since the beginning of the year. It was a hidden earthquake at the boundary of the plate, with earthquakes occurring in the past and active since the beginning of the year.
Over the next week, the aftershocks above level 4 will not be ruled out.
A lot of people think driving is something that only those who can see can do.
Blind people want to drive a car safely alone, and until now, it's considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we made a car designed for people with visual impairments for the freedom and independence of the blind.
Before I tell you about this blind car, let me briefly mention another project that I've been working on, called the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Program City Challenge.
It's about making a mechanical car that can drive itself.
You press the start button, you don't touch anything, and it's completely automatic to reach its destination.
At the 2007 Challenge, our team won $500,000 to win number three.
About that time, the National Association of the Blind, or the Blind Society, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would allow the blind to drive independently and safely.
We thought we'd try it, because we thought, "Hey, it's gonna be hard.
We've got an automatic car.
All we have to do is get the blind man to drive inside. That's it, isn't it?
But we're wrong.
It's not a car with a blind person, it's a car with a blind person who can make a choice and run it.
So we had to give up everything we had and start from the beginning.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype of a small sand truck to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited a lot of blind young people across the country and gave them a second chance to ride around with this car.
It's definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with this car is that it's designed to drive blind people in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot -- even on a little road with a red traffic cone.
So with this success, we decided to take the important next step, to make a real car that could travel on the real road.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complex system, but let me explain, to simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have the induction phase, the computational phase, and the non-visual interface.
The driver was obviously invisible, so the system had to be able to sense the surroundings and collect data for the driver.
That's what we're using with the initial metering element.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like human ears, inner ears.
I combine this information with GPS to predict the location of the vehicle.
We're also using two cameras to detect the path of the car.
We're still using three laser rangers.
Laser scans the environment to detect the barrier -- front, rear-bound vehicles, and any obstacle to entry, any barrier around the vehicle.
All the big information then aggregates into the computer, and the computer does two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the surrounding environment -- which is the path of the car and which is the barrier -- and to convert that information to the driver.
It's also very intelligent to figure out the safest path to a car.
We can also give instructions on how to run a vehicle.
But the question is, how can we transmit information and instructions fast enough and accurate enough to the blind to make sure he can drive?
To that end, we designed a variety of non-visual user interface techniques.
The initial three-dimensional flat system, vibrating vests, acoustic gears, leg belts, even shoes that pressure their feet.
But today we're talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called the driver handle.
It's a pair of gloves, and it has a vibrating component at the point of the finger, so you can transmit instructions on how to move -- direction and range.
The other device is called the speed band.
This chair -- actually, it's a massage chair.
We take it out, we reassemble the vibrations in different modes, we let them transmit the information on speed, and we have instructions on how to use the throttles and brakes.
Here, you can see how computers understand the surroundings, because you can't see the vibrations, and we actually put red glowing diodes in the driver, so he can see what's happening.
This is the sensor data, which is transferred from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, the handles and the speed band, are very effective.
But the problem is, these are command hints.
So it's not really freedom, is it?
Computers tell you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, accelerate, brake.
I call it copilot.
So we're avoiding command hint devices, and we're focusing more on information devices.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called an empty map.
Look at this as a monitor for the blind.
It's a small desktop with holes in it, compressed air out of it, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're blind, you put your hand on it, you can sense the path and the barrier.
In fact, you can change the frequency of releases in the air and possibly the temperature.
This is actually a multidimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the cameras on the left, on the right, and how the computer interprets and transmits this information to the blanks.
So, we're showing a simulation program, a blind man driving with an empty map.
This program is very helpful in training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories based on different types of non-visual user interfaces.
That's basically how it works.
But it's a model car, and it won't go unless it's proven to be as safe to drive as it is today, or safer.
I really believe this is going to happen.
But is society, can they accept this radical idea?
How are we going to deal with insurance?
How are we going to issue a driver's license?
There are many different obstacles behind the technological challenge that we need to address before it becomes a real reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car driven by a blind person.
But what's more important than that is the enormous value of the by-products of this project.
Sensors that can be used to see through darkness, rain fog.
And with this new kind of interface, we can use these technologies to make them safer for visible people.
Or for the blind, the household devices that live daily -- educational facilities, office facilities applications.
Imagine, in class, teachers write notes on blackboards, and blind students can use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what teachers write.
It's extremely valuable.
Today, what I'm showing you is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

Marinichev said that changes in value were influenced by the devaluation of the rubles and the epidemic.
He said, "The cost of services is increasing.
As a result of the epidemic, people are beginning to spend more time on the Internet ... "
Malinichev does not rule out a significant annual increase in Internet prices, arguing that operators can provide customers with higher speed and more services to offset the dissatisfaction with rising prices.
"China Doctor" is a tribute to Xinhua Network, the hero of the epidemic.
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmen against the hero of the disease, the director of the Bona Film Group, Liu Weiqiang, directed in Guangzhou, held a talk with the Master of Chongnan Hills on the production of the anti-epidemic film "China Doctor".
The Bona Film industry wishes to pay tribute to the Chinese doctor for all the medical and vaccination workers who fought on the first line of outbreak control!
In 2021, the film will be presented as a national film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, the Bona Film industry is being deployed under the arrangements of the Chinese Ministry and the National Film Bureau, with the support of the Guangdong Province Film Bureau and the Hubei Province Film Bureau, to organize a film by the Chinese pilot, the Chinese doctor, which is reflected in the strong leadership of the Party and the unity of the nation in the fight against the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The film focuses on Wuhan ' s anti-epidemic front, using the background of Wuhan medical staff and provincial and city rescue teams, unique narratives and powerful lens language from a human point of view, and presents a moving story of Chinese medical personnel dedicated and sacrificed on the front line of the fight against the epidemic.
It is known that during the first days of Wuhan's release, Bona was able to overcome all the difficulties by sending a team to get inside the epidemic, exchanging information with hundreds of health-care workers, and gathering information, and that a large number of precious first-hand video materials have been taken by white angels on the frontline of the anti-epidemic front, including the Chomnansan Monastery, Guangzhou's first helper Wuhan, Guangdong's medical team, and the Wuhan Jindang Hospital, Wuhan and the hospital, Wuhan University's mid-south hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital, and others.
"I'm looking forward to visiting not only some of the more visible experts, but also more of the medical staff who are working on the front line, who are the majority of them."
He said he'd seen me and my motherland, the Chinese captain, and thought it would be good to tell the story of the big picture from a common man's point of view.
"Some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
Referring to the distribution of the film, Master Chung Nansan said that some people abroad currently prefer to put the virus on a politicized label, and he hoped that the film would impress the audience from a human point of view: "This film, in addition to being shown in China, should also be shown abroad, in a way that is understandable to both domestic and international audiences, and in a true human spirit."
Mr. Chung Nansan also remembered the film "Man to Middle Ages" of the 1980s, "Those years have passed and I've been most impressed with "Man to Middle Ages" when my friends from abroad cried, and it would be amazing if "Chinese Doctor" could do that."
Master Chung Nansan said it would be very successful if "Chinese Doctor" could be resonant with foreign audiences.
During the conversation, Master Jong-nam also shared his opinion and recommendations on the current international epidemic, "I believe that people are always smarter than the virus."
According to Master Chung Nansan, although the virus is difficult to predict, humans have survived so far in the primitive world, where modern societies have developed medical technologies and social management measures, together with a basic understanding of science in the face of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic around the world and even among the general population, where people are no longer as passive as they used to be."

Hwangnan Daily News, a client reporter for New Hunan.
Ka Hing's Red Ship Model, Maize Tung's bronze statue, Yan An Boo's flowerwork, and Yan Xi Yong Shun's meat ... On July 25th, the Hunan Red Tourism Cultural Festival was inaugurated in Jinshan.
As one of the main events, the first Red Industry Fair was held at the Global Tourism Advisory Centre in Sasayama.
The exhibition area is full of red and original products, and the revolutionary old area is full of dirt products, which bring tourists from all over the country to buy each other.
" The Red Games are both a demonstration of the achievements of the national red cultural industry and an important platform for the exchange of experiences between exhibitors and businesses in exploring development paths ... "
The head of the Executive Committee of the first Red Games, which were devoted to the theme "Handing the red culture to warm up", presented an exhibition area of nearly 3,000 square metres, setting up an atmosphere-building area, displaying an exhibition area and a web site of the Red Literary Network.
We invite 137 companies, including Jia-hing Zhejiang, Ka-hung, Guozhou, Yanan, and my Governor, Sha, Changzhou, Yeo-yang, Changzhou, etc., to exhibit a total of 768 exhibits, including red artifacts, handicrafts, food specials, tourist routes, red training courses, red original products, etc.
The exhibit will be on display until 29 July.
As the host of the Red Games, the show has come to light.
The director of the exhibition area introduced the division between the red industry and the growth of the red cultural industry.
The Red Industry Fair displays 31 exhibits from six enterprises, including Wallithlite steel, Wallith cable, thorium power, and the Red Cultural Industry Development Fair displays a red series of books, a red series of food products, a red series of creative products, and nearly 200 products from 27 establishments.
In the Yanan area, many tourists are attracted to displays of flower handicrafts and paper cut art.
According to the director of Yanan City's Department of Culture and Tourism, Madong Po, the exhibition carefully selected Yanan's excellent red original product for the last two years, 16 of which were 2019 national red originals.
At the same time, they invited the National Intangible Cultural Heritage Conservation Project "Anse Scissors" and the provincial non-residual project "Sang Bei Min Song" to promote Yanchuan folk-specific products, and took the opportunity to communicate with other exhibitors and promote cross-regional cooperation.
The cumulative number of new cases diagnosed in Japan is over 30,000 - Xinhuanet
According to statistics, 239 new confirmed cases were recorded in Tokyo on 26 days, and more than 200 new cases were recorded for six days, bringing the total to 11214.
In addition, 141 new confirmed cases were reported in Osaka, 90 in Fukuoka and 80 in Aichi.
In the first half of the year, there was an increase of 70 per cent in fraud by telecommunications networks.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecution Service prosecuted 58101 persons for fraud, a 35 per cent increase over the previous year.
In particular, the number of fraud-related offences is high, and the number of fraud-related offences prosecuted by the Public Prosecution Service accounts for 43.4 per cent of the total number of fraud-related offences.
The Supreme People ' s Procuratorate has provided targeted guidance, and a total of nine cases involving fraud have been published in 10 typical cases involving the prevention and control of the epidemic.
In the first half of the year, the prosecution service dealt with a wide range of offences involving fraud, up to the country's macro-policies, down to people's food and clothing, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health-care" fraud, "publishing agency" fraud, "hidden lending" fraud, State subsidy fraud, "freezing of national assets" fraud, and so on, and has continued to "new" in areas such as education, health care, employment, old age, social security, land-hunting, poverty alleviation, financial credit and so on, causing not only economic losses to victims but also serious economic and social development.
In particular, there are telecommunications network frauds that break across borders, territorial and human constraints, and that have characteristics such as crowding, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, and are not specific groups of victims and are highly harmful.
For example, specialized companies have been set up, high-end writing buildings have been rented, departments or posts have been created, legal networking platforms have been used to promote, recruit, train and test recruiters, and business models have been used to manage them, wearing "legitimate coats" have become more confusing.
It is incumbent upon the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to give prompt warning to the public and the relevant authorities.
In the case of the Judiciary, the Public Prosecution Service takes seriously its responsibilities by maintaining a high level of pressure on fraud and tailoring law enforcement initiatives to promote social governance through, inter alia, the issuance of prosecutorial recommendations.
The Public Prosecution Service has strictly restricted arrest, prosecution of fraud cases, evidence, procedures and application of the law, based on the facts, the law and the law.
In particular, in the case of fraud in telecommunications networks, the focus is on the central role of electronic data in factual findings, and efforts are being made to build the evidence chain of electronic data, verbal evidence, cross-substantiation between documentary documents.
In the case of an epidemic fraud case handled by the Ningbo District Prosecutor ' s Office in Zhejiang province, the first intervention by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, from the time of the incident to the time of its closure, took only five days, reflecting the attitude and determination of the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to maintain stability in society.
In reviewing the arrest and prosecution chain, focusing on the prosecution of those who missed their case, correcting the failure of the public security organs to catch 733 persons, correcting the omission of the public security organs to examine and prosecute 1,113 co-perpetrators.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecution Service issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations against fraud, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud and promote deeper governance.
For example, in the case of communications enterprises found in the case, banks, intermediaries, etc., where there is a gap in the regulation of the telecommunications network, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Guangdong Province and the Dongjung Municipal Public Prosecutor ' s Office have issued timely recommendations to the authorities to strengthen their supervision, improve mechanisms and help to build a system of efficiency.
Four is doing everything you can to get the damage done.
The local procuratorial authorities seized on the important points of involvement in the investigation and led the evidence, examined the prosecution, and urged the investigating authorities to actively pursue the recovery of the proceeds, cooperate with the relevant authorities in their efforts to minimize the economic damage caused to the population by the crime of fraud.
For example, the Beijing City Prosecutor's Office handled a loan package in Lin, which involved 22 estates waiting to be closed, initiated a "suspended execution letter" in the event that the property could be pre-empted in other cases, sent to the relevant court in a timely manner, and recommended that the court should suspend the property in question until the facts of the crime had been established, and that it should do its utmost to recover the property in question and recover the damage suffered by the victims.
The prosecutor reminds you to be very vigilant about fraud, not to expect to drop a pie in the sky, not to think it's cheap, and to keep your money bag.
Quanning County, Guizhou: The apple tree is short, the way out of poverty - the new middle net.
Source: China Economic Network.
Inflammation of the summer, Economic Daily - Chinese Economic Network journalist walks into China Village, Jina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
In the face of the sun, the villager Li Won-chung groved grass in the base, but he sang a few little songs from time to time, though his face was red.
Weining County, where the town is located, has not been able to sell a good price because of its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light, very hot day and night, high sugar in the apples produced, good taste, a certain reputation in the surrounding area, but also because of its small size and its large number of spots, it has not been able to make a good offer and it has not been able to form an industry.
The town was once a poor town with a high incidence of poverty of 25.8 per cent 10 years ago.
During the critical period of the fight against poverty into a decisive victory, it is imperative to change traditional cultivation practices, restructure industries and increase farmers ' incomes.
After a number of visits by Chen Tai and a group of people in the town, Chen Su-hwan concluded that industrial development could no longer go the same way.
To that end, the town of Jinnai has introduced a leading business to grow apples in a modern way.
The Deputy General Manager of Winning Beyond Agriculture Ltd., Hu Jianwen, in 2015, came from Tsangxi to the town of Tsang, looking at the conditions of the local planting, starting in 2016, to the local planting of apple trees.
At first, when the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to turn the land out to plant apple trees, the couple made a sound: "Once they've grown apples for so many years, they don't see who grows apples in the village making money."
"All the apples grown are short apples. They don't grow too tall. "
What's unexpected for Li Yuanzhung is that this apple crop has a new way of working, with irrigation pipes under every apple tree, water and fertilizer pouring into the roots, and when the fruit is collected in the fall, the tractors drive straight into the orchards, and they pick the fruit on their feet.
The Apple Base is now gradually entering productive life, and the market, as Hu Jianwen had expected, is not unscathed. Apples are very popular with consumers in cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc.
The growing apple industry has made a new difference in Li's life, although it's still growing land, but it has a new source of income.
Nine acres of land flowed over to the Apple Base. Every year, in addition to the land transfer fee on the bottom, there was a profit bonus after the hanging fruit. The couple usually worked in the base, "One man gets $80 a day, one gets work every year."
Lee Won-chung told reporters that last year's profit was more than 2,800, plus land transfer fees and the couple's wages, and that the family earns 80,000.
"Acre apples produce more than $15,000 a year, about 10 times the value of maize grown."
Chen has told reporters that the entire town has now planted 20,000 acres of apples, 6,000 acres in the village of China alone, covering 4056 families and 17.2 million people, including 656 poor families with slated cards, 2952 people, and more than $6 million a year in wages, making it possible for the base to be built in front of its home and not to go out to work.
Lee Won-chung, who's growing up in his pocket, has also begun to realize his own wish.
This spring season, Li Yuanzhung bought a Land Cruiser, like driving the car to work today, and "The family has more than a dozen acres of land, and when the next apple base expands up, it's going to pass on to them, and they're going to earn more."

The membrane separation technology helped crack the greenhouse effect.
The membrane separation technology helped crack the greenhouse effect.
A map of the new hybrid matrixing technology
Reporter Swe reported that the atmosphere environment and bioenergy team at Tianjin University had made significant progress in the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) for the "membrane separation method" and had succeeded in developing new technologies for hybrid membrane preparation to significantly improve the carbon dioxide capture performance of the membrane material.
The results were published as an article on the cover of the international journal Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
The greenhouse effect is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for the greenhouse effect.
The efficient capture and utilization of human carbon dioxide emissions is the focus of scientists ' attention.
The membrane separation method is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology that separates carbon dioxide gases with the help of membrane material and is efficient, energy efficient and simple to operate.
How to "breathe deeply" membrane material, improve gas separation efficiency, is a bottleneck to capture CO2 using membrane separation.
The scientific team at Tianjin University has developed innovative ideas to explore the effects of different solvents on the separability of membrane gases through repeated experiments.
Experimental results show that N-methamphetamine is used as a pre-position solvent, resulting in a more even distribution of carbon nanotubes in the membrane material, "breathing more air" and effectively increasing the efficiency and speed of gas separation of the membrane material.
With this new technology, hybrid matrixes, CO2 separability is close to the current theoretical separation cap for this type of membrane material.
" New technologies provide new ideas for membrane separation techniques to capture carbon dioxide ... "
Li Yun, a member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team at Tianjin University, said, " We hope that this technology will provide strong support to future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies in handling flue gas and will play a significant role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.

Before volunteering, you'll have to figure out what a professional is-- a new network.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning newspaper
Before volunteering, you'll have to figure out what a professional is.
Every year, students or parents report to the High Test because they are not aware of the terminology involved in the voluntary filing, which in turn affects the voluntary filing.
This year, Beijing Transport University, Beijing Science and Technology University, Beijing Post and Telecommunications University, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing Chemical University, and five higher schools jointly launched the 2020 admission policy to eliminate professional differentials.
What is the significance of professional underperformance in voluntary filings?
There are three ways of assigning a profession.
Experts remind that, before reporting on voluntary contributions, it is important to read the Statute of Admission to Heart School and to understand the rules of admission to higher education, including the rate of transfer, the rules of professional assignment, etc.
Professional allocation rules are defined as the three types of post-secondary placement in which the main professional priority is given to admission to the profession, with priority being given to the points and the professional grades being different.
Which way the college uses specifically will be specified in the Admissions Charter.
But there are also some institutions of higher education where the overall priority is given, and where there is no difference in grades.
This means that candidates within the range of admissions are queued according to the total score, and when the score does not reach the first professional voluntary entry score line, it is determined whether the second professional voluntary entry score line is reached, and so on until the last professional volunteer is accepted, with no difference in rank between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "disciplinary difference" is one or more of the points published in the admission charter for the selection of candidates for the different specializations, which is the "disciplinary difference".
That is, the difference in the scores of students enrolled as volunteers in the first and non-first professions, the difference in the grades among volunteers in the various professions, e.g., 3 points, 2 points, 1 point.
For example.
Assuming that Ming is taking 560 points at A High School, his professional volunteers are: computers, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, professional admission at A High School is based on a professional grade differential of 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
In the case of professional assignments, if the junior professional volunteer meets the requirements for professional admission and has a planned balance of profession, the junior professional will be admitted to the "computer" profession; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, ranking 558 points as candidates for the "international trade" examination of the first professional volunteer, determining whether the qualification is met; if it is still not met, the third professional voluntary "automated" entry will be reduced by 1 point (i.e. 557); if it is still not met, the next professional will be admitted to the fourth profession (i.e., 556) and the next professional will not be reduced by any more, and so on.
Different university-level differentials.
With the spread of parallel volunteering, many higher education institutions have now eliminated their professional grades, but some of them have retained this method this year, with more than 20 universities having established their professional grades, according to the "registry charters" published by the schools.
For example, Sichuan University of Agriculture, Shandong University of Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Teacher University, Chengdu School of Medicine, Northeast Electricity University, American University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Industrial University, Ningxia University, Shandong Technical University, Chinese Institute of Civil Aviation Flight, etc.
In these colleges, the differences of specialization are different in each university.
Some institutions of higher learning have grade differentials in each field, such as the University of Ningxia, where files have been sent to candidates, in order of reduction of professional volunteers by one point, according to the order of candidates.
And some universities have different levels of specialization between different professions.
For example, at the University of the United States of America, the total margin for professional volunteer grades is 4 points, i.e. 3 points for first-professional volunteers and 3 points for other professional volunteers, no hierarchy for other professional volunteers, considered parallel voluntary, and 1 point for other professional volunteers and 1 for transfer professionals.
When volunteering, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported schools, see if there are any professional differences, what the type of differences are, and, while taking the scores fully into account, make a sound analysis of the schools and professions to be selected. If the admission rules of the institutions are clearly based on grade differentials, when selecting a profession, the candidates must pay attention to the gradients between the various professions and increase the rate of admissions.

The first Atlantic hurricane this year landed in Texas, where the epidemic hit hard.
The United States National Hurricane Center announced this morning that Hurricane Hanna had reached 145 km per hour and was expected to cause heavy rains in southern Texas and north-eastern Mexico until Monday, which would cause rapid flooding.
With the gradual movement towards land, customs have diminished and, despite local power outages, no casualty statistics have been reported for the time being.
Some local officials in Texas are preparing to deal with tornadoes that are likely to occur along the coast.
President Trump tweeted that the Office was closely monitoring the dynamics of Hurricanes Hanna and Douglas in Hawaii and called on the population to listen to the emergency management information of the local government and to protect families and property.
At the same time, the new crown epidemic in Texas is rapidly worsening, with a rising number of infections, cumulatively more than 390,000 confirmed infections and more than 5,000 deaths.
In the wake of this hurricane, the Government will face the twin challenges of sheltering the homeless while preventing the epidemic from worsening again.
For the first time, an ad hoc committee was set up to sign a "long date" for the third World Expo.
The first meeting of the Alliance of Exhibitors of the Third Expo was filmed in Shanghai on 26 July.
On 26 July, Xinhua Club Shanghai called (journalist Zhou Ri), for the first time a professional committee was set up at the Third Import Expo Union, the first of which included the Special Commission on Public Health and the Special Commission on Breastfeeding, and 35 member enterprises signed a three-year long-term memorandum of cooperation on the exhibition, and the link between the Fair and the Alliance is growing.
At the first meeting of the Alliance of Participants of the Third Expo, held on 26 June, a three-year long-term memorandum of cooperation was signed by a group of exhibition members, such as South Korea Modern, United States Tod ' s chemistry, Japan ' s Academy of Capital Sciences, New Zealand New Zealand, Siemens, France, Michelin, and the United Kingdom ' s Aslikon, and the revised and refined Charter of the Alliance was also published for the first time.
The opening ceremony of the Specialized Breast Industry Committee was filmed in Shanghai on 26 July.
According to the latest constitution, the Alliance will introduce a lead unit rotation mechanism to enhance the functioning of the Commission.
The Panel will make recommendations for the analysis of trends in industry to promote the sustainable development of industry.
At the same time, the consolidation of industry-wide chain resources, in large and small terms, will lead to the emergence of related firms and will make the Expo a confluence of industry enterprises.
The establishment for the first time of the Special Commission on Public Health against Pneumonia is particularly important in the fight against the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
As Vice-President of the Public Health Prevention and Control Commission of the Third Expo, the General Manager of the Rapid Diagnostic Operations of the Greater Central China District, Jianping, said that, as a next step, APEC would join forces with more industry partners to explore new solutions and modalities of cooperation to help China and the world fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The inauguration of the Specialized Committee on Public Health Prevention was filmed in Shanghai on 26 July.
According to the information received, for the first time, the Third Expo established a public health quarantine zone and, to date, nearly 50 global companies have signed up to exhibit over 10,000 square metres.
During the first Expo in 2018, the Alliance of Expo Participants was set up by a voluntary initiative of the exhibitors to serve as a platform for high-quality business exchange and cooperation to connect the exhibition ' s information- and resource-sharing platforms, as well as a think-tank for promoting trade and commerce and development between China and the countries of the world.
To date, 142 enterprises have joined the exhibitors ' union, covering 23 countries and territories around the world.
Three-year-old Belgian girl died of new coronary virus infection - Xinhuanet
The Belgian health sector stated on 24th that a 3-year-old girl died of a new coronary virus infection, the youngest of the country ' s new coronary patients.
The Belgian health-sector spokesman, Boudwin Cutterri, said that the girl had other serious diseases prior to contracting the new coronary virus; in addition to the girl, an 18-year-old had recently died from the new coronary virus.
Cutley said that 85 per cent of the new coronary patients in Belgium last week were under 60 years of age.
He reminds the younger people of their health and not to take it lightly.
" Though it is rare for young people to die of new coronary virus infection, no one is immune... "
Last week, the number of new cases diagnosed in Belgium rose by 89 per cent compared to the previous week, with an average of 2.9 deaths per day from the new coronary virus, up from 1.7 per day the previous week.
During the peak of the European epidemic, the Belgian population accounted for the highest number of new coronary infections in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
According to the latest data, a total of 64,847 people in Belgium are infected with the new coronary virus.
Cuttley warned earlier this week that before snowballs roll bigger and bigger, eventually an avalanche, people have to act.
In an effort to curb the resurgence of the epidemic, the Prime Minister of Belgium, Sophie Villemes, announced on 23 August that the regulations governing the wearing of masks in public places would be tightened and that the programme for the further lifting of restrictive measures in August would be suspended.

Xinhua Society Hong Kong, 25 July. Qiu Tenghua, Director of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development, Government of the Hong Kong SAR, 25 July, stated that all APEC member economies should act in concert to combat the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should refrain from creating unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations established by the World Trade Organization.
Qiu Tenghua made the above statement at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 25 Trade Ministers' Video Conference to Combat the New Crown Pneumonia Epidemic.
At the meeting, ministers exchanged views on the substantive options that APEC could take to respond to the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic and to promote economic recovery in the region.
According to Qiu Tenghua, the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic has had unprecedented far-reaching social and economic impacts.
"We are in a double battle, and we must overcome the epidemic before we can recover the economy.
We need to have a clear goal that the virus is our common enemy, that cooperation will win, and that will only fail ... "
According to Quintom, the new coronary pneumonia epidemic has triggered a series of trade restrictions that will not help control the epidemic.
Trade is the key solution to the current problem and should not be seen as a problem.
He condemned all policy measures that were discriminatory and fragmented, and urged all economies to remain open at this critical juncture, maintain smooth supply chains and avoid trade barriers or irrational trade policies.
Four hundred and forty-four thousand new crown cases have been diagnosed in the State of the Middle East, the second most affected country in the United States of America.
Sino-News Network, 26 July, combined, according to the website of Johns Hopkins University in the United States, as of around 8.34 p.m. Beijing time, more than 414,000 new coronary confirmed cases were reported in Florida, more than 411,000 in New York, the second largest epidemic area in the United States since California.
According to the Florida Health Service on 25, 124 deaths were reported in Florida on 24th.
This is the tenth death toll in Florida since the beginning of the new crown.
The total number of cases reported in Miami Deed County, the most affected in Florida, is more than 100,000.
There are currently 8,974 new coronary cases in Florida, of which 1874 are in Miami Deed.

The operation will take over 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government to extricate themselves from poverty, to uncover stories of life and poverty, to confront the dramatic changes in the village and to demonstrate how the villagers are going to break through the path of survival and development and move towards prosperity.
This operation will last for over three months.
