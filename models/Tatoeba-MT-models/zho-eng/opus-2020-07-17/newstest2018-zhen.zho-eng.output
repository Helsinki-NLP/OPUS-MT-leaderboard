Civil rights groups have issued travel warnings against Missouri.
As a result of Missouri ' s discriminatory policies and racist attacks, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued a travel warning to colored people preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Consultation, which came into effect on August 28, 2017, called for all African-American travellers, tourists and Missouri to pay particular attention and exercise great caution in travelling in Missouri as a result of a series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri in the recent past.
NAACP noted that the recent adoption of a Missouri law made it more difficult to win discrimination proceedings and that the state ' s enforcement of laws targeted minority groups to some extent, prompting the organization to issue travel warnings ...
The violation of civil rights is happening to people.
They were questioned for their skin colours, beaten or killed, "Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
"We have received many complaints, an unprecedented number..."
This is the first such warning ever issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The organization cited the racial defamation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black male in Tennessee, Tori Sanders.
earlier this year, Saunders died in suspicious circumstances, spent fuel fuel while travelling in Missouri and was detained without charge by Missouri police.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that "Black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be stopped than whites."
Chapel said, "The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri."
"People need to be prepared to travel to Missouri with bail, or to let relatives know they're travelling in the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime report, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the crime, the state ranked 16th in the country.
Travel warnings are also a response to the new Missouri law, which will make it more difficult to prosecute businesses that discriminate in housing or employment ...
Prior to the adoption of immigration law enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to detain immigration offenders, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicated that it would increase the number of racial litigations and issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have taken this approach in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.

BBC called Beijing the most exciting city: to make the foreigners feel like they're living in a new era.
The English media reported on January 18 that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern city of charm.
The Chinese capital, which has an alarmingly high-speed Internet, has sophisticated technologies such as face-to-face recognition software, has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has unmatched internationalized energy, and it is one of the most exciting cities for a foreign country rich in exploration.
According to the BBC website on January 16, German expatriate Clemens Sethi said, "If I can do it there, I can do it anywhere in the future." He quoted a singer, Frank Sinatra, who sings the words of New York City.
"If Sinatra survives today, he's likely to sing about a city like Beijing." He says, living in this city will make you feel like you're living in a new era, always keeping up with the tide.
Home in England, but recently, Simon Norton, who lives in Beijing, published an article on his personal blog website 4 Corners7 Seas, which says, "People generally have a feeling of being at the centre of something big, and it's hard to say, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it looks like, and they want to witness it."
It was reported that the city ' s high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment made daily life easier than ever before.
From Manila, Andy Peña Fuert, who is currently the deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children's Web site, says, "Beijing is rapidly turning into a cashless society, where the Internet integrates traditional wallets to smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions."
However, reports indicate that smart phones are only the beginning of Beijing ' s technological ambitions, that facial recognition software has become widely available, and that many mobile phone applications use this technology for bank transfers and payments, allowing people to enter apartments and offices, and even to use it to verify the identity of network drivers.
Beijing has also recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in building an artificial intelligence technology park, where more than 400 enterprises will settle and focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies from biometrics to autopilot.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in China over the years, which are celebrated by foreigners. Spring is one of the most important social and economic festivals and one of the most accessible.
"I propose to help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year's Day, clean their apartments and put a new year's blessing on their doorsteps. On New Year's Eve, all members of the family will come together to eat a great meal, and then watch until midnight and greet the New Year with a radiant fire."
It has been reported that the number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but the language barriers in China and the ease of communication among the diaspora can easily be used as a pretext for their incomplete integration into the local culture.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for many years, but they have had little experience with their host country. If your initial attempts to reach out to the Chinese have not been successful, then it's easy for you to have a feeling of being with other foreigners.
In these so-called "foreign bubbles" ("foreign bubbles" means foreigners mix only among foreigners and do not touch local people and local culture — translater's note), foreigners hug in their own community, eat in Western restaurants, and friends only foreigners.
The simplest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin -- it's simpler than one might imagine.
Seth says, "The Chinese private lessons of one or two hours a week, or the introductory radio show, should fit everyone's busy schedule."
Even a few classic short sentences would help with shopping, ordering meals in restaurants or chatting in taxis.
It has been reported that persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, although in recent years the Government has tried to contain some problems.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities during often lighter warm months of pollution, using the blue sky as an opportunity to tangle in long-standing alleys or explore popular solar parks.
And Norton said, "Beijing is the Chinese city that can find the most things on the surface, and you can find great artistic and musical activities, long nights, historical wonders, super-modern commercial zones and ancient alleys."
According to the report, the role of ageing as an impediment to human capital growth is increasingly evident, especially in the north-east, where ageing contributes to human capital growth at an average annual rate of -1.28 per cent.
According to Pan Kwan, the risks of cross-border capital flows are currently manageable, and the underlying factors underpinning the balance of payments remain long-standing.
On December 17th, the China-China-News Network Beijing (Reporter Gaukay) launched the International Summit Forum on the Restoration and Conservation of Chinese Ancient Books 2016, which opened on December 17 at the People's University of China.
In April of this year, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-package software such as Google Search and Chrome Browser, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The EU Commission considers this to be detrimental to the interests of consumers and an impediment to competition ...
The EU regulators initially requested Google to respond by July 27.
If an anti-monopoly charge were found, Google would face a fine of up to 10 per cent of its global revenue, amounting to approximately $7.4 billion.
Google hasn't commented on it yet.
Google is also being investigated by the European Union because of the search results that favor home shopping services.

A picture of Bitcoin's legal status around the world.
Abstract: In addition to the price retrenchment that is naturally triggered by speculative properties, the fall in the current round of digital currency is also related to the "hosting enemy" - regulatory risk.
From visual maps, Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude than the West, countries with global dominance are still looking at digital monetary legitimacy, representing a "black swan risk" that remains high.

With China, South Korea and the European Union, the major markets of Bitcoin, where the global digital currency headed by bitcoin has been bled out since this week, bitcoin prices have fallen by $10,000 on Tuesdays and the largest single-day fall in three years.
In addition to the natural price retrenchment caused by speculative properties, the fall in the current round of digital currency is also related to the constant "neighbour" - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the big visual data site HowMuch.net produces a map showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of Bitcoin across the globe.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legitimate market of Bitcoin; orange yellow represents the neutral market, although it has not publicly legalized the status of bitcoin, but there are no major restrictions on its use; light pink represents the restricted market, where local governments try to use digital currency through red-line policies or regulation; dark pink represents the country defined as illegal; grey is the country that has not yet been evaluated.
(The above figure is drawn by the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15)
According to the article, the traditional attitude of Eastern countries of Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West, as can be seen from the green mass distribution of Central Africa.
Russia is currently the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets in Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries to have not yet adopted a relevant policy.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bitcoin, i.e. more concentrated distribution of green pieces.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America are distinctly divided, and the colour distribution of the above-mentioned areas is more mixed.
Among them are Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil, the legitimate Bitcoin market, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, among others, where there are some restrictions on their trade and use, and more Latin American countries, which have not spoken.
Combined with the above data, a total of 99 countries (or 40 per cent) of the 246 countries surveyed globally have unrestricted transactions and use of bitcoin, i.e. green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) are restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4 per cent) define Bitcoin as illegal (deep pink), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) do not treat digital monetary information more (grey).
This suggests that countries with a global majority (53 per cent, more than half) are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the digital currency headed by bitcoin in their territory, and that the "black swan risk" of bitcoin is still significant, as some of them may eventually take legislative decisions to limit the number currency.
According to the article, the emerging category of digital currencies has not been fully understood by global regulators and may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a pronouncement.
Although Bitcoin's "human face" has grown exponentially since last year, it does not represent an interest for all countries, and there may be countries that fear that local French currency will be threatened as a result, or more so that digital money will be used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street interviews have written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China's start on a centralized online service platform against off-site exchanges and mobile App. Korea is still considering closing the digital currency exchange. The EU considers that Bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of "bringing it back to the ground".
The editor-in-chief of Wall Street selects "Records" 2018: "The Global Ministry opens the Digital Currency Year"? It was mentioned that 2018 will be the Global Central Bank Digital Currency Year either from the perspective of regulation, acceptance/criticisation and adoption.
Big powers like Russia criticize the legitimacy of bitcoin, but also to give way to official digital money.
On January 8th, Xinhua Madrid, New Aid Cotiño, Barcelona (Reporter Xie Woo Ji) first showed up with a pizza shirt in Nokamp.
Kutinio passed a medical check-up in Bassa that morning and signed a contract with Basa President Bartoméu to expire in the summer of 2023.
Then he showed up as a Bassa player in front of nearly 7,000 fans in Norcanp.
According to the Spanish media, Curtiño's total transfer of contributions amounts to Euro160 million (approximately RMB 7.77 (Euro 1)), the first price of the Club of Bassa and the history of Nishika.
As Kutino is still wounded, he will have to rest for almost 20 days before he can get his own virgin show in a pizzard.
What else is sacred?
Now the White House in Trump is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statue.
So, in 2003, Saddam Hussein of Paradise Square in Baghdad was deliberately pushed down.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers of the Trump government, must have known what would happen when Jim Acosta, of CNN, engaged in an intense debate about the President's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
If he does, a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers will eat him alive.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was carved on the base in 1903.
As Miller denounced Acosta, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to light the world...
The poem you refer to, which was added later, not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
In fact, Miller was right, but, as he said himself, it's not really about history.
This involves a modern echo of the language of Lazarus, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowd of people who want to breathe freely,/the suffering reject your crowded beaches."
There's no such thing as the refusal of the suffering man on our screen.
Miller didn't do literary reviews, and he made it clear that these people were not welcome in the Trump-era America.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the American spirit ...
Lazarus, and her friends, who engraved her poems on the base after her death, are well aware of the highly political nature of the acts in which they are involved.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the link between French and American republicanism through the old classic metaphor of the feminine identity of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the image of a woman was no longer abstract, she had to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
This poem, combined with this painting, is a successful feminist coup d'état and a devastating blow to American indigenousism.
Just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wing always wanted it back.
The great speaker, Rush Limbagh, an ad interim Baptist of Trump, in 2010, argued that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, but that he was an early neo-conservative who brought the fire of American wisdom to a world of ignorance: "The Statue of Liberty is invincible."
She meant to take the torch of freedom from America to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the path of America ... "
What's unusual is that Limbo was actually touched by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the perspective of the perception.
Lazarus' most imaginative approach is to be able to see it... when weary, poor but hopeful people can see it on the deck of the ship after a long and often terrible journey.
On the face of it, it's about the world's perspective of those who seek refuge and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them and requires the hope and welcome they hear.
Of course, that's not what Miller and Trump were trying to say.
Their torches are not to light the road, but to ignite hatred from their only source of power.
In 2006, Sacap became the first Chinese to sign a contract with Universal British Headquarters with a unique musical style.
The 2017 World Cup: Neil Black highly praises Scotland's team in the British National Team.
Eilidh Doyle remembered that there were only two Scottishs in the British National Team.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the Athletics Association of England, said that a 16-strong Scottish team from the World Cup team would make a huge contribution to the National Team.
The highest number of Scottish field athletes ever picked up for the London Athletics World Cup in 2017, which opened on Friday.
Black thinks that "Scotland is making an extraordinary development," from which English trackers must learn.
"We accept this and try to understand it, and we will persevere until we succeed, " says Black.
"I'm talking to members of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish trackers think it's about what they're doing.
The Athletics Association of England thinks it's about what they're doing.
Even street people think so.
Whatever it is, it's brilliant. "
A number of Scottish trackers are contestants, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be 5,000 metres below Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle is selected by the team as captain.
"Erid is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible." Black said.
"Many trackers, whether Scottish or not, or wherever they live or train, walk out of the house with pride and energy.
The passions and true feelings that Eric naturally put into are great. "
The winner of the Commonwealth silver medal for his fifth World Cup 400 meters across the line says there are 16 Scottishs in the British National Team, and it's "unbelievably."
Previously, there were up to seven Scottish track and track athletes in the World Series, i.e. in 1983 and 2015.
In the past year, she has made five British records and two European records.
She's going to compete for 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who participated in the 1500-metres contest, was another notable Scottish player who had achieved great success in the season and won the British pre-elections and the Olympic anniversary, respectively.
Doyle remembered her participation in the first World Championship, when the only other Scottish on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said that she was very proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team, but also, in some cases, challenge the medal and race to the finals.
"The special thing about being a captain of the National Team is that it was elected by the other members of the National Team. So, knowing that your teammates voted for your extraordinary achievement, it was a great honor for me anyway," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots.
It's just a sign of how far we've gone.
And they're all old track and track players here, track and track players who are about to move towards the purpose of the Medal.
What did my captain say?
Well, I think it's great.
I'm just referring to the fact that, in this case, we're very lucky because we're having the World Cup in the main arena.
That is why it is really important that we grow up with home support and return to the Olympic stadium.
I will be given a second chance to compete, and there will be a wonderful atmosphere ... "
In 2016, there were 180,000 employees in China, and the cost of employees was $121.8 billion, an increase of 21 per cent over the previous year.
Curb critics on Facebook: if you can't stand the blame of voters, don't run for office.
Our father knows how bad media works.
The Americans loved Washington, but shortly after that, major newspapers began to speak out against him, from domestic policy to political principles.
He's pissed off about these criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn't silence those critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of expression is denied -- we'll be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance."
That reminds me of the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people's posts because they put their views on his Facebook page.
U.S.C.C.L. filed a suit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff thought the suit was rash, and the online coverage was full of their fierce resistance: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
This is particularly important because people like Hogan are faced with.
It's a Republican governor in a state with a democratic majority, and he's surprisingly popular.
Of the country's 50 governors, he's ranked second.
Hogan is not a reactionary rash.
He's in charge of Maryland, strictly following the rules.
He was also very good with Facebook as the main way to communicate with voters, showing his bald head after chemo on the home page for the first time.
So whoever comes to the governor's homepage comment is completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Shas, defended the Governor's actions by saying that she believed that he was just trying to keep them from doing anything.
But they were too hasty to describe it as a flood beast or cynic overflowing the network.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people who were blocked by Hogan.
They're just ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: they're teachers, small business owners and priests, not some flood beast.
They say their comments are profound, respectful and not dirty.
The priest quotes the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Lamani, a barrister in Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the Washington Post news story review section, "I'm very polite to comment that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes and other recent news incidents.
I also don't like a bunch of people commenting on the same subject because they are simply ignored by people who think they're so-called people from the heart, rather than treating them as citizens who are worried about their country ... "
The governor's staff called "intensible garbage bombing" may seem like "persistent" to others.
Facebook makes it easy to change a message, just to shield a critics or delete a negative comment.
And it was much cleaner than in the past, when it was necessary to send staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments or arrest or silence protesters.
But that's what's happening right now, just at the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for scolding others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
There was a landmark ruling last week in Virginia about this kind of issue.
According to the District Judge of Alexandria, James c. Cacharis, in the United States, the Chairman of the Lawden County Supervisory Committee blocked voters from her Facebook page in violation of the First Amendment.
The state governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevan (R), was also visited by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postal bills and the Internet had similar influence.
The number of newspapers had quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and people had written anonymous letters criticizing his leadership.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous flood beast against him.
People write to newspapers under false names such as Julika, Valerius, Belisaius, Porgius, and so forth, critical of Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper online project, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his attitude to the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America, signed with the United Kingdom.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and speech are the foundations of this country.
And true leaders need to accept that.
The wiring of the city's wind is holding people's sensitive nerves.
Restriction is a hard line in many urban real estate regulation policies.
(a) In May 2017, Jinan introduced a six-month period in which undergraduates would be eligible for equal access to housing for residents of the local permanent household;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy whereby university students can be registered with a diploma and an employment certificate within three years of graduation.
Subsequently, the policy was added, with the official saying that "university students can buy a house at less than 20 per cent of the market price".
In July, Chengdu introduced a rule that young people with undergraduate and higher degrees in field universities could apply for a residence permit.
In addition to this, cities or regions such as Shanghai and Shanghai have introduced "brain-in-kind" policies that lower the threshold for home-buying.
Zhang Xuan believes that it is actually the cities that compete for people, especially people, and retain people, especially people, to be competitive, which is the most important of these real estate policies.
Some even think that this means that the time has come for the city to cancel.
The director said on that day that the film was planned for a long time, that the first script was edited in 1999 and that he was even looking for the Golden City Wu to play Yan XIII.
Ronan Lafferty looks forward to enjoying his home at the Renaissance Club.

It's really a special memory, and we'll always remember it. "
Back to their homeland, Gary Orr, who was only 50 years old earlier this year, then took part in the European Youth Tour.
This is his first competition in Scotland since the 2013 Scottish Golf Open.
Helensburger Orr said, "The game will always have more meaning at home.
You want to be good; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed being in the game again. I've been playing golf.
I am satisfied with the current state of affairs. "

In August, the Director General of the Environment Inspectorate of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China introduced in Beijing a total of 57 cases of daily and continuous punishment, and the new amendment to the Environmental Protection Law introduced earlier this year clearly added to China's environmental enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection agencies in all parts of China can use such punishments as daily and continuous punishments, seizure, lock-down and transfer to administrative detention to detect and punish environmental offences, and cooperate with the judicial authorities to punish environmental crimes.
According to the head of Zou, in August, a total of 335 arrest cases were closed in all parts of China; 177 were suspended in cases of confinement; 189 were transferred to administrative detention and 166 were transferred in cases of alleged environmental pollution.
Of these, Henan has imposed seven consecutive daily punishments, and China is now moving from last-end control to full-scale environmental pollution control.
Despite the downward pressure on the economy, China's Ministry of the Environment has previously made it clear that China should properly address the positioning of environmental protection in economic development and enhance the "green force", and that the more the economy grows, the less the environment can be relaxed and the better the role of environmental protection for the economy can be optimized.

The Russian media claimed that Putin would own a new national car: 15% less than a Mercedes per unit.
The Russian media reported on January 18 that Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Mantourov said that President Putin's "car fleet" had a unit price of 6-7 million roubles.
The budget target is to keep the price below 15% below the Mercedes-Benz S level.
On 16 January, the Russian network reported that between the end of February and the beginning of March, the main research and development unit headed by the President, the Russian National Automotive Engineering Institute (NAMI), would deliver 16 vehicles to the Federal Security Service.
According to reports, the "car fleet" project requires the manufacture of three types of cars — a car with a car, a three-car and a minibus — for the country's number one person using a unified modular platform. The budget allocation for the project is 12.4 billion roubles.
According to the report, the first state-made and long car ever made for the President of the Soviet Union appeared about five years ago. According to the R & D unit plan, the new car will be equipped with 800 horse motors and armor, with a full load of 6 tons.

Isn't the next toilet we're going to have no paper, so that's what we're specifically focusing on in the new three-year plan?
We need to fix this imbalance that's not enough.
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what people think.

Poverty and death in Phnom Penh, Indonesia
Baddina Dejay didn't use a stove when she was cooking.
She doesn't even use pots.
Her cabin is located in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai district, Papua Province, Indonesia, where the housewife usually puts only a potato — the locals call it "nota" — directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burnt potato was taken out by an unwashed hand and devoured by an infestation.
Dejay sits on the mud -- she doesn't have furniture, and this is where she does her daily household chores, like washing clothes, washing water, all from nearby swamps.
There's a bucket in a room without a roof. It's an outdoor toilet.
She's the youngest of the four wives of her husband, so she's not assigned to the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it's dangerous to work late: most men in the village are unemployed and many are drunk and there are many soldiers here.
She said, "No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.."
It was a rare glimpse of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, once a colony of the Netherlands, incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, which was also controversial when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the army that occupied the area.
The current strong demand for independence, and the campaign against Dutch rule, soon again, targeted the Jakarta government, which has a high-handed rule over the region, isolating foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enerotali is remote and empty; it takes 90 minutes to fly from the provincial capital Chayapura to Nabyre and then to rent a car for five hours, and to go all the way in the stomach.
There's no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, outside the cabin is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the wrinkled iron roofs are all kinds of rusty shades.
Few Indonesians come in, let alone journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian preacher, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here.
Djay says, "We don't like these clothes." She means her colored turban, her dark shirt and her fancy half skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and is the region with the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is Indonesia's gold continent.
Paniai County is about the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Glasberg, only 60 miles from here, owned by Philip McMolland Copper Gold, based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, the timber resources in Papua are very rich, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
But these vast resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papuans, which is why the powerful military forces of Indonesia have been able to suppress them all along.
According to a 2005 New York Times survey report, Philips paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for one official alone.
Papuans' growing claim to independence threatens the gold lord and they are subjected to cruel treatment as a result.
According to defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands of the Papua tribe in the 1970s escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A report by the Catholic Brisbane General parish in 2016, "We will lose everything", includes evidence of the perfidence of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — another report that rape and electrocution are particularly common — and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
According to the Indonesian researcher Andrias Harsono of Human Rights Watch, "The violence takes place every day, and it is difficult to calculate the number of victims... "
Papua's resources brought in large numbers of immigrants outside Indonesia, and oppression began.
Eighty-three per cent of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but the demographic structure of Muslim economic immigrants has changed since they arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javan snack stand sells a combination of fried chicken and vegetables with peanut butter.
The locals struggled.
24-year-old Paniai native Abos Yu moved to the provincial capital Chayapura to find a job, explaining that "those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans.
This has caused the local Papuans — the mama-mama — to lose their market ... "
The President of Indonesia, Zorko Widodo, who is often called Zokovi, vowed to address the inequality and abuse of power in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The carpenter's road to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta was supported in 27 of the 29 regions, including Paniai.
But Papua hasn't changed anything. Today, the locals feel betrayed.
You said, "We're heartbroken, and in 2014 we voted for Zorkovi, hoping that he will fulfill our wishes and restore justice."
In fact, just two months after Zokovi took office in October, Paniai had the worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, Enarotali 11 children sang a Christmas hymn in front of a bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly came on a motorcycle.
The frightened kids told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local pastor, Aveit Tebai, one of the soldiers was angry with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses said that the drunk soldiers were chasing the kids with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
16-year-old Julianus Yemmore was severely beaten and unconscious.
A few hours later, a fire broke out in the nearby government agency election committee building and the incident escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They danced with a ritual bow, dancing with the waita of the Mee Pago tribe -- running around and imitating birds.
Some protesters started throwing stones at regular military posts.
According to an official document seen in Times magazine, when emotions continued to intensify, soldiers were ordered by internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately..." but this document was not released to the local media.
56-year-old Jeremiah Kayamu, the leader of the Enerotali Kego Koto neighbourhood, felt the imminent danger and appealed to the crowd to calm down and beg them to return home.
But no one's in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his beautiful cabin and told Times that when I turned back, my left wrist was suddenly shot. "
Kayamu still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he says the bullets came from among the assembled soldiers.
And he said, "It was crowded and they fired a lot."
According to the cousin of the local Alfius Juul, he witnessed the shooting and saw that Alfyous Yure was shot three times.
Juhanes sadly told Times magazine that I ran over to check his body to see if it was him.
I found him dead and I kissed him. "
Inspector General of the Papua Police, Yoji Mende, told reporters that his subordinates were only at the "protective" police station because the police station had been attacked.
In 2015, the police spokesman for Papua, Chief of Police Puggio Sulestio, said, "We have to defend ourselves when someone threatens to kill us.
It's a matter of life and death. "
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The next day news of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi gave a well-spoken speech in Jayapura, expressing deep sympathy to the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuse left over from the history of Papua.
He said, "I hope this case is settled as soon as possible so that this will not happen again in the future."
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Valando, stated that he would set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations ...
But the excuse to get away is almost instantaneous.
He said, "Most of the violations took place a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but this will require a process ... "
And then on June 5th, in Jakarta, Virando went back on the conversation with Time magazine and said he didn't have a plan to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be settled according to the law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Virando for "offences against human rights" in the 1999 bloody independence vote in East Timor, but he says that 11 human rights violations in the Papua area have been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Pani incident are scorning these remarks.
Yohanes said, "I've had four interviews in the last three years, but things haven't progressed at all."
Years later, he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, of being shot. "
His brother Yukabus also thinks the people of Paniai are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping bury the four victims.
He said, "When the body was buried, the military came to me."
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Dayay County, Paniai Neighbourhood.
A manager of a construction company refused to help transport a unconscious man to a hospital, and there was a clash, one man died, and 17 others were injured, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Lavinus Dowu, drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired warning shots.
But the Riot Mobile Force (TNI) started shooting at the crowd and one man was killed.
29-year-old Dominiya Buddy told Time magazine, "We were all panicking and now we're afraid they'll get revenge." "He lived near the hospital and saw the wounded rushed into the hospital.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The parliament of Deyay has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the mobile anti-riot forces to be withdrawn from the area.
Panai has always been a land of right and wrong for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has contributed to the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which are scattered in the central highlands of Paniai.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by spreading attacks and raiding Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Paniai, including Tadius Yuji and Daniel Yodas Kogoa.
As a result, thousands of Pani have been arrested in recent years by the military under the guise of "preservation of national sovereignty" and deliberately detained.
Some people never show up again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Paniai is a "forgotten place of tragedy".
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enerotali's selling rice is poor, and the locals can't afford it.
The bread is so far away.
People here grow everything they can: mostly potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five pieces of sweet potatoes.
They usually use most of the harvest to sell the rest on the local market.
Ten potatoes worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has spread among the local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of the new route to the airport at Nabyre.
The few jobs available are usually in the hands of better educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans have little money or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
"The young people don't want to stay in this village because there's no job and no money. "
Papua is isolated from the world.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lonchen were expelled from Papua because they were "not cooperating with the authorities", even though they had rarely been authorized to film.
According to Deputy Director of Asia of Human Rights Watch, Felim Kane, the electoral vows of Zorkovi to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
In a statement, he said, "If foreign journalists try to cover the disgruntled provinces of Papua and West Papua in the easternmost parts of Indonesia, they are at new risk: denial of visas and blacklisting. "
The absence of media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the neighbouring countries of Papua.
In March, 6 Pacific countries — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands — asked the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's “various and widespread human rights violations”, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries also supported the Free Papua Movement.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Almanata Nassir, who had no interest in the group ' s allegations, told the Jakarta journalist that "the democratic institutions in Indonesia and the freedom of the media make it difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations. "
Locals want more foreign government attention.
According to an informed source, on 4 May, when the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Keith Van Barr, led a delegation of officials to Jayapura, the local people broke their silence and cried, "We want freedom." He also attended the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans claim that they are unlikely to vote for Zorkovi.
The Chairman of the Tribal Council, Gobai, said, "Zokovi's intentions are good, but he's surrounded by people involved in the Pani shooting."
He wanted to let Zokovi know that the people of Paniai not only live under the threat of a greedy army, but have nothing, that the region is poorly educated and that public health care services are scarce.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, think that the vote they voted for Zokovi is a debt he has to pay.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic protest: the body of the victim was buried opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
Youkabus bowed his head and said, "My family was killed.
What else can we do?"
Sofya, Hollywood, top brands are using capital to force the home industry to fight. On February 10, 2017, the CSRC approved an initial application from Guangdong House and Homes Co. Ltd. and issued a permit to enter the market for the mid-sized board of residence, after having just passed by IPO for more than 20 days.
In the industry, it is believed that, with the mating of the home and the subsequent listing of the European family, the custom-made home area, which was already in the air, will be shifted from a competition for products to a competition for capital.
At the beginning of the new year, the news that a typical representative brand-based home in the area of customizing the home was about to be marketed attracted the attention of the entire household industry.
According to Reuters, 9 Beijing Time, Samsung Electronics released on Tuesday its first set of auto-drive components, jointly developed with Harman International, and an information and entertainment solution, which is an important initiative for the company to enter the electronic market for military vehicles.
Three star electronics acquired Haman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Fair (CES) in Las Vegas this week, Samsung issued collision alerts, traffic diversion alerts, cruise control cameras, which were developed in cooperation with Haman.
Three Stars plans to start this year with this camera system, which is built on technology such as automatic machine learning and scaling up.
The three stars also showed "digital cockpit" and even if the driver was not the owner, it would make the vehicle more personal, as the system allows users to download the driver's data from mobile devices and clouds.

Once again, the fire has swallowed the Tower of Dubai's Torch.
On Friday, a fire in one of the highest residential buildings in the world in Dubai forced hundreds of residents to flee the high 337 m, 79 floors of super-high buildings.
This is the second fire in just two years that swept through the high-rise building, and happened to happen to be the sky tower known as the torch.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported, and the cause of the fire has not yet been identified.
"We're sleeping, and then we wake up with a fire alarm and people start screaming.
We run down the stairs, down from 50 floors, it takes about 10 minutes, "A resident named George told Reuters.
According to the civil defence authorities in Dubai, the fire brigade extinguished the fire around 4 p.m. local time and is in the process of cooling down the building.
The Government has indicated that it is working to provide refuge for the affected persons ...
The accident could rekindle concerns around the world about the safety of the use of outer wall materials in high-rise buildings.
In a survey conducted by the skyscraper management after the fire in 2015, it was found that most of the damaged objects were covered with decorative and insulation walls.
The British police have indicated that they believe that the problem with the insulation and overpainting system at the Glenfield Building in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams convoy also suggested that Massa might return, even though he had announced his retirement.
On 9 January, just one month before the opening of the Ping Chang Winter Olympics in Korea, the atmosphere in Korea has grown stronger as the Olympic fire spreads from the south to the north and preparations intensified.
Korean public opinion expects this long-defeated inter-Korean meeting to bring an egg to the Ping Chang Winter Olympics in a month's countdown.
On November 1, last year, the Pingchang Winter Olympics fire arrived in Korea.
The heat of the fire was reflected directly in the sale of tickets to the Pixen Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, Ping Chang Winter Olympics had only 32 per cent ticket sales, the Winter Paralympics had 4.3 per cent ticket sales, and the low ticket sales rate was once a source of concern for the people of Ping Chang Winter Olympics.
But as Lee Heefan, Chairman of the Pingchang Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, recently predicted for journalists, "The Winter Olympics are getting more hot as they pass the fire across Korea, and it's believed that the sales of tickets will soon improve."
According to Korean media reports, as of 3 January, Pingchang Winter Olympics ticket sales had reached 64 per cent, and Winter Paralympics ticket sales had exceeded 50 per cent.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to the Korean Olympics, the Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on 8th that it would extend the stay of foreigners visiting the Korean Winter Olympics for up to 120 days.
The investigation found that more than one in five American travellers had boarded the plane with prohibited items.
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had boarded the aircraft by means of illegal goods, intentionally or unintentionally, via a United States Transportation and Security Administration checkpoint, and that at least 6 per cent of those passengers had boarded the aircraft unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1% of passengers claimed that they only later discovered that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
This investigation against more than 1,000 people was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc., which also found that young travellers were more likely to be in flagrant disregard of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately attempted to board TSA contraband, 19.7 per cent were millennium generations, compared to 15 per cent for the X generation.
The most common items of deliberate passing of TSA security officers are food and drinks.
More than 3% admitted to having intentionally carried the blades through security checks, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents indicated that they had intentionally boarded the plane with prohibited drugs.
The company claimed that the investigation of the country ' s travellers was carried out in order to find out the number of people who had boarded the aircraft by accident and intentionally carrying embargoed goods.
It is not surprising that those most likely to carry embargoed goods through security checks — intentionally or unintentionally — are those who fly most frequently.
However, the company pointed out that the TSA guide was a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People don't usually know what and how much fluid they can carry.
So it's not surprising that TSA caught the most contraband liquids.
There was a time when it was thought that TSA might have used books as an embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry them.
US EPA Prutt changed his mind about Obama's era emissions reduction regulations.
One day after being prosecuted by 15 states, the Environmental Protection Agency's Director, Scott Pruitt, changed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama's era air emissions reduction regulations.
Pruitt proposed this change because the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state bodies that regulate the environment than the previous government.
He made no mention of the legal challenges brought by the Federal Court of Appeal against his predecessor.
The controversy focused on setting October 1 as the deadline for states to start meeting the 2015 ground ozone standard.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for one year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and to avoid "disrupting local decision-making or impeding economic growth".
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was the State Attorney General of Oklahoma, who had long opposed the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruett has repeatedly turned to preventing or delaying regulations against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal obstacle to Pruett's return to the agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Director of Environmental Protection had exceeded his authority and tried to delay the implementation of the Obama administration ' s requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and mitigate methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Prute proposed a major shift in his attitude towards the ozone standard, expressing the need to strengthen the commitment of the Environmental Protection Agency to working with the states to adopt complex procedures to achieve new standards.
Prute said, "Under previous government administration, the EPA usually failed to meet the prescribed deadline, then waited for the radical groups and others to sue and agreed to set a specified timetable by agreement. "He initiated dozens of prosecutions against the EPA in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the rules and authorities seriously ... "
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Prutt may again use his "extension authorization and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the provisions are consistent with "good policy and best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for extensive rewriting of the ozone layer regulations.
The House Bill approved last month was intended to delay the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The New York State Attorney Eric Schneiderman led the state alliance this week to sue the US EPA for its intention to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said, "The reverse of the US EPA — after we filed a lawsuit — was an important victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke emissions."
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., joined the New York State in this case.
Ground-based ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants from cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources to sunlight exposure in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe respiratory problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Prute for his amazing transformation.
Lori Ann Bird of the Biodiversity Center says, "It's disturbing that this common sense measure is under great pressure from the heads of the departments that protect the air we need to breathe."
"We must fight the Trump government ' s ideological movement to cater to the polluters and special interest groups... "
In addition to the externalities of steel heating, businesses are also struggling to reduce costs.

Recently, the Japanese animated "Your Name" in Asia, after becoming Miyazaki's director, the film broke 20 billion yen for the first time in 15 years and took the second place in the ticket room.
Since the second half of 2009, Xiaoshan tree sales have remained high, especially this spring, when Xiaoshan Hsiao Hsiaogi's sales have reached an all-time high, sales have increased significantly and prices have risen sharply. According to statistics, the income from the Xiaoshan mountains from January to June of this year increased by 48 per cent over the same period last year, with the largest increase in nearly 20 years.
The Deputy Director of the Xiao Mountain Forestry Department, Xi Hae Yong, said that, along with good sales, Xiaoshan Hanaki production was growing faster.
In the past two years, Xiaoshan tree cultivation has expanded by 30,000 acres, with a total area of 180,000 acres, while at the same time actively developing beyond the area, Xiaoshan seedling farmers have established 80,000 acres of flowerwood bases throughout the country, an increase of 30,000 acres over 2008.
In parallel with the expansion of the area under cultivation, the quality of seedlings has been improving, the value of nurseries has been increasing, large specifications, high-quality seedlings have been retained and some of them have been sold.
He also warned that, in the face of the current boom, producers should face it calmly and objectively, seeing that the demand for flowers in society will be long-term and increasing, while recognizing that there will be more competition in the market.
On the morning of 13 July Beijing Time, the American company Somaltus filed a suit in the Eastern Texas District Court against Apple for violating a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.
The same patent was used by the company to sue Wah-suk.
The lawsuit alleged that both iPhone 6s and similar apple equipment violated US patent 7,657,386, entitled "Integrated Battery Services System".
The plaintiff sought compensation in cash or a patent fee for post-judgement tort equipment.
It appears from the indictment that the plaintiff argued that the iPhone ' s fast-filling function violated the company ' s patent.
An iPhone with a fast charge will charge up to 80% of the electricity quickly and then trickle up.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "proprietary hooligan" because it doesn't provide obvious products and services and it's hard to find information online.
However, they have succeeded in reaching an out-of-court settlement with car manufacturers like Ford and Japanese.
The Meeting recognized the importance of accelerating information development, promoting the integration of resources, making efficient use, increasing the digitalization of industries, and raising the level of intelligence in order to promote "China's production of 2025" and popular entrepreneurship, in order to create innovation, foster new energy and improve the quality of people's lives.

As a result, the railways have expanded the 12306 website, introduced new services during spring tickets, and nearly 60 per cent of tickets no longer need to be certified.
According to the leaked phone records, Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post leaked the phone records between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
It was reported that the President of the United States had expressed dissatisfaction with his public criticism of the wall and that he had allegedly said to him, "Don't tell the media."
During the presidential campaign, Trump promised to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
His phone records with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also made public, showing a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. deal for refugee repatriation to Australia was "preposterous", "disgusting" and "diplomatic," that he had suggested that the U.S. ban the resettlement of refugees and now insisted on the deal under Obama's administration's good offices, which would make him look like a fool.
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call of the day.

The Moor Beach tragedy: Racist lynchings and justice for activists
A 1948 Ford Mercury car ran through a crowd of viewers in the town of Monroe, Georgia, running towards the little Moor Beach Bridge.
The car was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and a group of white men with guns were in front of the bridge, blocking the way forward.
The thug's boss, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, took a deep breath of cigars and looked into the windshield.
The passengers in the car are full of fear.
"We want-- Roger!" The man shouted.
Get him out of the car!
A young black man was dragged down from a former row of passenger seats and screamed and stunned.
Fortunately, on July 22, this terrible scene was only a repeat.
But when Roger's neck was covered with ropes, almost all the crowds sighed.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moor Beach Bridge, reproducing the scene of two black couples -- Roger and Dorothy Malcolm, and George and Meryl Dossy -- hanged by three-K lynchings in 1946.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, and we saw them in the community, none of them have been arrested in these years, which is incredible." Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize this reoccurrence, said.
"This is the stain of history, the burden of our souls."
Brooks 71 years old, a former member of Georgia's parliament and lifelong rights activist.
For him, a repeat is a remarkable call to action that reminds the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to sue, we want to close, we want to heal, we want to reconcile, but we must first get justice," he said.
"Unless we get justice, we will not be cured and reconciled... "
On July 27, 1946, the coroner laid a sheet on the body of a victim of a lynching on Moor Beach.
According to the FBI files from the National Broadcasting Corporation News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of being involved in lynchings.
But none of them have ever been prosecuted.
While suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists have stated that the dual motives for lynchings are well known throughout the town: political and sexual ...
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the initial elections later in the summer.
According to the FBI, at about the same time, a black tenant, Roger Malcolm, stabbed a white landlord, Barnett Hearst, in a fight that looked like it was for a woman.
Brooks says the town rumor is that Hearst slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and her baby wasn't her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, high-profile white landlord Roy Harrison spent $600 bailing Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and cousin MacMary and George Dorsey went to prison with him.
But when they came back from prison and came to the Moor Beach Bridge, a mob of thugs surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder," an FBI report came to that conclusion.
" It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness ... "
Brooks is very concise.
He said, "It's a voting tragedy."
"They were killed, and the murderer sent a message to the black people of this community: "If you register and vote, you will have the same end."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has been in charge of the annual repeat of the Moor Beach lynchings.
She behaves in a way that's obvious, insensitive, with a deep racist background. Many people want this kind of racism to cease to exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, it's harder not to see, but Green says that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because it makes us face the ugly side of everyone," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me or hear me tell my story, I can't make a relationship with you."
This year's show started in June, with nearly 30 actors on the first day - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - crowded in a room and listened to Green's release of a rehearsald performance overview.
Wade Malbau is the co-director of Green.
He's been playing the role of the Klan for years, but he says it's never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Malbau said.
"But I think it's important to keep this history alive, because we don't want to go back to that era... "
In the room, actors like Roger Malcolm and Barnetthurst, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona are rehearsing their lines.
At the beginning of the scene, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hearst away, angry that he had slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my house!"
Rascona's backtrack.
And then they fight.
And then everybody laughter.
Green smiles the best.
"What's going on?
He's panicking, confused.
Am I too much?
"No," Green laughed.
"I just don't think white people say "ah" when they fight back."
"Yes," another black actor plays fun.
"You have to be strong."
So, the energy in the room changed; the feeling of love drove away the feeling of discomfort.
Everyone tried to do it not only for the performance, but also in memory of the four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, Lascona used to say "ah" with a sharp and strong tone.
No one smiles.
The reenactment is strong and fast.
The screams, the gunshots, the silence.
A woman in a funeral black, standing next to an actor, singing Billy Harold's words of condolence, the strange fruit.
Her voice slammed through other words.
A hundred yards away, about 40 viewers swirling their sweat and tears.
Blacks and whites make up almost half of the audience.
There's a couple from Ithaca, New York, and a lot of people live near the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm and Dorothy's grave for nearly eight hours, and everybody was suffering Georgia's uncomfortable wet fever.
But now, on the same land where lynchings took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer and examine the body of the actor.
The children bowed down, watched fake blood and corpses, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbling, like a reminder to himself.
In a few minutes, Green will thank the crowd and then the show will be over.
Actors shake the lynching ropes and wipe the tears off.
Bradshaw embraces a man in a suit who plays the three K's leader, Malbau.
Nick Rascona hugged two of his colleagues and wept in their arms; the emotions in the show eventually infected him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispered.
"We know you don't have it in you.
You did it for a reason. "
After that, the audience sat down and had dinner with the actors.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted closely with a black couple they just met, talking about reoccurrence.
Dennis Duplinski had difficulty finding words to describe how she felt after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those terrible words and behaviors that people like you say and do because they look like you," she said.
"It really made me think that lynching was still going on, and she added, "Now this is just a police shooting."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sits at the table watching, tasted and reminiscent of civil rights.
He said he's already planning next year's show.
"Recurrence is an encouraging way because it describes the horrors we've experienced, but it's also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not study and do not know their own history are doomed to repeat their mistakes ... "
For natural gas market-based reforms, the importance of "regulating the independence of the grid" is self-evident, but resistance and controversy are also greater.
The journalist was informed by Kaiji Hebei Group that at 11.25 a.m. on 7 a.m. there was an explosion at the emulsification workshop of the Kaiser Chemical Company Ltd., located in the ancient smelting area of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, in which 13 operators were trapped.
So far, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued and taken to the hospital, while the remaining 12 are under intense search and rescue.
It is known that the scene has been sealed off and that the local public security, fire, medical, etc. are in the process of being rescued.
According to witnesses, there was a loud noise and a mushroom cloud in the air.
According to members of the Open Group, which organized a search and rescue on the ground, Tangshan Kaihai Chemical Co. Ltd. is located north of Zhao Chao, a State-approved site for the production of civilian explosive devices, located in the Gumel district of Tangshan City, Hebei Province. It was established in 1958 and was formerly known as the 6O-2 factory of the Open Mining Authority.
Since the news came out 15 years ago, João Jayon must have produced a new album every year, but last year he lost a rare date.
The fans, however, did not express any dissatisfaction, but instead offered their blessing, because the reason for the failure was that Jay was happy to be a father.
After a full year and a half, last week, Jayon finally arrived in Beijing to present the first piece of his father's promotion, as well as his 14th album of his music career, "Jeryn's Pre-Sleep Story of Chow".
US medium: China Air Force Engineering University scientist researching laser satellites for the removal of space debris
The American media reported on January 18 that Chinese scientists had made a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up chaotic Earth orbits and destroy old satellites and their sky trash.
According to a 15 January report on the United States Newsweek website, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Study on small-scale space debris transformation models for space-based laser removal", which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers into smaller, less hazardous fragments by using space-based platform lasers.
It was reported that space debris had been a concern of the International Space Agency for many years, and NASA had considered a variety of options for tracking and detecting and removing artificial debris.
Large-scale space debris has been removed by means of meganets used to clean and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to absorb them out of orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted laser simulation studies to conclude that this will be an effective way to clean Earth orbit.
The summary of the paper states: "(Simulation studies) provide the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser space debris removal technology...". "
A 2014 study by the United States Defense giant Lockheed-Martin found that there are about 200 threats per day for satellites in orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth orbit is considered a serious threat to future space missions and has been described by experts from the European Space Agency as a "lethal chain of threats".
As also reported on January 17th, the American monthly mass machinery website says, space is essentially empty, but it's getting crowded up next to the Earth. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris around the Earth and, over time, it will accumulate.
The more debris there is, the more likely a satellite still operational will be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
It's been reported that all space agencies have plans to remove space debris in the future.
NASA is considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of debris and de-orbit it, Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan is thinking of using an electrical chain to capture debris.
At the moment, China is also proposing a solution to the problem of space debris, namely, the use of a large laser to strike floating space debris into less harmful little fragments.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in the German monthly optical magazine, the installation of such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean space, at least according to simulations.
It was reported that the only way to prove effectiveness was to conduct tests and that there were no arrangements for such missions, but perhaps sooner or later someone would install lasers on satellites and send them into space.
Once it's done, we can finally start ridding space debris once and for all.

Retrenchment of 3000 positions by PSC, substantial reduction of dividends to revive operations
On Friday, the British Education Group called for an additional 3000 jobs and a substantial reduction of 72% of the medium-term dividends, as it had started another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
According to CEO John Fallon, most post reductions will take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after 4000 posts have been reduced in the previous reorganization.
PSC announced in May that it plans to cut an additional Pound300 million ($394 million) in the third cost-cutting project in order to revive operations that are hit by rapid digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its shares in the Penguin Landon Bookhouse to partner Betasman and published a report that its basic sales rose by 1 per cent in the first half of the year to £205 million, but that this year ' s outlook remains unchanged.

A suicide bombing attack on the convoy in Kabul killed NATO soldiers
According to official sources, a military convoy was hit by suicide bombers in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others ...
NATO statements indicate that five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in this incident in the Karabagh area of the city.
This is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan - the bombing of the Herat mosque on Tuesday caused more than 30 deaths.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to the NATO statement, there was an explosion on Thursday night, and a joint Afghan-NATO coalition patrol was attacked with an "personal improvised explosive device".
The statement stated that all the wounded were currently in stable condition and were being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to journalists, the growing Taliban and so-called Islamic State (IS) organizations in the Karabakh region have raised serious concerns about NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, while the capital accounted for about 20 per cent of deaths.
A suicide car bomb attack in late July in a Shia-dominated area of Kabul killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claim they launched this attack.
On 31 May, a huge explosion took place in the centre of Kabul, killing more than 150 people, the deadliest armed attack in the country since the overthrow of the Taliban by the United States-led multinational force in 2001.
The violence highlighted the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighed whether or not to increase Afghan troops in support of his army and police.
Journalists have reported that suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the Government and its policies, particularly in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) action to overturn resolution and delay smoke regulations
When Obama was in office, he made a provision to the states to curb the emissions that caused the smoke, 15 states to sue the National Environmental Protection Agency. One day after the indictment, EPA overturned the rule.
The US EPA announced on Wednesday its decision to continue the so-called "Ozone Target 2015" and promised that it would work with the states.
In a statement, United States Environmental Protection Director Scott Pruett said, "We have confidence in dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to them. "
Pruett announced in June that the EPA plans to postpone the implementation of the ozone compliance area standard until October 2018, with a one-year delay - based on this standard, measurement of existing smoke pollution in some areas to determine which areas should be reduced to meet air quality standards.
15 major Democratic states, as well as the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday alleging that the act was illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump ' s authorities have been working to restore the environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts have provoked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups who fear that more emissions will affect public health.
The US EPA website states that breathing ozone-containing air "will reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.

Mikey Garcia and Vasili Lomachenko met for the first time to explore possible future battles.
The most notable, 147 pounds-low boxing contest will take place soon, and Vasili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia will meet for the first time on Thursday in a state of potential conflict.
In separate rooms in Los Angeles ESPN's office, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion García took the lead down the corridor to pay tribute to the world boxing organization's super-featile champion, Lomachenko.
At the Showtime fight on Saturday, the judge unanimously concluded that García had won the victory of Adrian Bronner, the world champion of the four Divisions, and that both fighters had become the top five players on the same weight list.
Garcia reached out to her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck. "
In the ESPN competition at 7 p.m. Saturday night, Lomachenko won Miguel Mariaga and preserved his position.
When the two of them took pictures, Egis Clemás, the agent of Lomachenko, pointed out that the potential confrontation between the two players depended on the perfect size.
"I used to be lightweight," Jasira.
"I went up against Bronner, but I didn't weigh that much.
I'm a little overweight compared to 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he had to be lightweight (135 pounds) before we could fight.
That's what fans want.
Then we'll satisfy them. "
Lomachenko agrees.
"The boxing world needs this battle. "
Clemás asked him whether he should pay the fees, and part of his strategy was to get Lomachenko to run a premiere with a 135-pound player later this year, hoping to set a date with Garcia next summer. García was also interested in fighting the winner of the battle with Jorge Linarez-Luc Campbell after the Forum's lightweight champions in September 23rd.
"As all the fans are asking the question, this battle may be on a fee basis," says Garcia, after which he expressed his openness to the competition on the network that offers the best financial options.
"We're the principals.
The rest of us can't get so much attention.
As long as they're ready..."
Garcia appreciates Lomarchenko's "a great player" and may be watching his boxing match on Saturday.
But Lomachenko hesitated to praise Garcia, saying he thought that this tri-borough champion from Riverside looked slow.
Garcia says the point is to show the power of the fist and then the boxing.
They all say they can feel the momentum of their boxing fights.
"This is the battle that has to be fought,
Concern and heat are beyond the reach of other boxing competitions.
I'd be happy to play, "Jascia says.
He said, "I've been waiting for the top warrior, and it's Mikey's turn this time.
It will be a great battle. "
A major environmental volunteer event on the theme "Green Homes, Motivating West City" was held yesterday in the West Side.

The early completion of the 11th Emission Reduction Target by the CDRC officials has given the steel industry a strong expectation of recovery, which has been constrained by limited electricity production.
Although the steel plant has not yet received a clear notification from the local government that the energy-saving emission reduction effort has been closed, it is estimated in industry that, on or about 15 December 2010, each of the formerly restricted steel plants will be reproducing and the price of the steel will begin to be pressured.
The end of the restrictions has not yet been notified, but in fact the pressure from businesses has been much smaller than in September, October, when a private steel company in Hebei province said to reporters...
The northern branch of the river has repeatedly issued restricted production documents and, at one point, has imposed restrictions on the production of enterprises by means of a forced lockdown.
Journalists have learned from local businesses that steel plants in most of Hebei are now back in operation and production restrictions have been reduced.
My steel network analyst, Zhang Tieshan, expects that the end demand for building steel will gradually shift from strong to weak due to the winter in the north.
The phase-out of energy-saving emission reductions will be completed by December 15, when most steel plants will have largely returned to production and products will reach markets by New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on the right price of steel.
On December 20, Chinese smart car-related sources told journalists at www.thepaper.cn that Chinese communications had acquired 70 per cent of the shares of the Joohai Guangbus, and that on that basis they had formed a smart car team for communications between China and China, whose amount was undisclosed, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.

The 68th Emmy Awards ceremony was held yesterday in Los Angeles, USA.
This year's drama has been so competitive that two newcomers have finally defeated an old actor: the Best Man Prize was won by the first-nominated Hero Rami Marek, and the Best actress by Tatiana Maslani of Black Orphans.
The big winner of the Emmy Award is "The Game of Power" and "The American Crime Story."
"The American Crime Story" is a big prize for mini-scene/television movies, and "The Game of Power" takes 12 prizes, including the best drama series, the best director and the best writer, three heavy prizes.
So, the Game of Power has won 38 Emmy Prizes, making it the largest television show in history.
Unfortunately, this year's "The Game of Power" won't work on the actor's award.

International Online News (journalist Liu Xing): On 18th, the Economic and Commercial Affairs Branch of the Italian Embassy in China organized a China-Italy environmental talks, which resulted in an extensive exchange of views and a positive consensus between business and scientific institutions from both countries on cooperation between the two countries in the field of renewable resources in the light of the new situation.
China is known to have been represented by China Renewable Resources Development Co. Ltd., China ' s International Technology Transfer Collaborative Network, and by institutions such as the Global Energy Environment Exchange and the Bologna Regional Business Federation of Italy.
The representative of Italy stated that Italy had diverse environmental technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources and proposed pilot projects with China on industrial waste disposal, waste oil treatment and waste incineration equipment, while looking forward to extending China ' s environmental cooperation experience to other parts of the world.
Publication of the results of the latest age assessment test for asylum seekers in Sweden
Swedish asylum-seekers are tested using the latest method for medical assessment of their age, and the latest results show that over 80 per cent of the victims were sentenced to over 18 years of age, but not all of them believed in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmedicinalverket) started this test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees who claim to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Migration Board has brought 6880 testers, and the Center for Forensic Medicine has now published the results of a total of 2481 testers between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
80 per cent (2002 persons) were sentenced to 18 years of age or older, but in 25 other cases, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine determined that the subject "may be 18 years of age or more".
In 432 tests, the result was that the person was probably under the age of 18.
The test is only for people whose age is in doubt.
According to John Grant of the Forensics Center, these results are consistent with those of the previous months.
He said to The Local: "The data are not so different from those of the previous months, and the numbers are exactly the same."
The higher proportion of those over 18 years of age who have been convicted does not necessarily mean that the asylum-seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the Centre published 581 test results, stating 442 "showing that the subject has reached the age of 18 or over".
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests released and found that 243 of them had publicly indicated that they would be 18 this year.
An X-ray examination of the smart teeth, an MRI scan of joints, then analysis by dentists and radiologists, and this medical assessment was also questioned in some areas.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they undergo puberty earlier or later than normal age ...
He told the newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think that's the way to measure it.
It's not accurate to determine the biological age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it. "
However, Glandson at the Forensic Science Center defended the accuracy of these tests: "It is generally safe to say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small."
The greatest risk is that the person is under 18 years of age, which is about 10%.
The governor of West Virginia has announced a party change.
Thursday night, Jim Justice, Governor of the West Virginia Democratic Party, announced at a rally of President Trump that he would change the party.
"You like it or you don't." The governor's judge said.
"Today, after a lot of prayers and a lot of thought, I'll tell you... today I'm going to tell you as a West Virginian that I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor. "
The rally broke out and there was a shout.
"So, tomorrow, I'll turn the party into a Republican."
"As a coach, I'm gonna tell you it's time to start another game."
Trump promised to make a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia earlier.
Mr. Trump won 42% of the vote in West Virginia, and Justin didn't support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justin was selected as the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
Forbes pointed out that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
At the moment, he's worth about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night stating: "Governor Justinian's change is another blow to the Democrats, not to prevent our country from becoming great again, but to make our country great again."
"Democrats now have only 15 governors, and control of the State Council is the lowest in history. The Governor ' s statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unifying slogan " , according to Rona McDaniel, the woman president of the Republican National Council, in a statement to the CBS News.

Sebastian Coe paid tribute to Russia's "probably frank" apology for the stimulant scandal.
Thursday, Sebastian Ko, President of the International Association of Athletics and Athletics, expressed appreciation for Russia's apology for the stimulant scandal and stated that the apology was “constant”, but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to re-engage in the campaign.
The President of the Russian Association of Athletics and Athletics, Mitri Chirac, at the International Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, stated that his country was rightly prohibited from participating in the campaign and that he was determined to combat doping.
He said he was sorry that "all the athletes who won gold and silver medals in the game were deprived of medals."
Despite his comments, the Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban. Previously, the report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) referred to the discovery of evidence of Russian State-sponsored doping, which was implemented in November 2015.
"I think today's response was very frank and very frank."
"The entire Council and the General Assembly of the Federation are pleased ... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has gone through a very hot period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can retake the game ... "
He says he's also "happy" that Russia has accepted the criteria for re-entry.
"I think it's a very constructive day, and I think we've made some progress, but the U.N. Congress supports the Panel's recommendations. It's not the time to restore Russian eligibility."
"We need to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has been the desire to separate innocent athletes from the contaminated system." He adds.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict standards of the International Federation of Fields, will compete as neutrals in the World Athletics Championships to be held in London on Friday.
On Monday, the head of the FIAT Task Force, Vern Anderson, said that Russia had not yet met a number of criteria for resuming its participation.
He told reporters after a speech to the International Council in London that drug testing was still inadequate and that banned coaches were still teaching.
At the first anniversary campaign of the Beijing City Smoking Control Regulations, held this morning, young student delegates who won the National Youth Smoking Micro-Video award interacted with the National Smoke Control Image Ambassador, Huang Xing, and reviewed the call for video and the award-winning exhibition of excellent works.
From the event, the journalist of the evening learned that young actor Wong Hoon was hired as a national cigarette-control image ambassador.
Huang Yu, who smoked himself at the university, successfully stopped smoking after fully recognizing the smoke hazard. This time, he took on the role of Ambassador for Non-Smoking, calling on young people to stay away from tobacco.
The audience wears a mask and becomes the ghost of the story. It's the biggest game of the Night of Insomnia.
The People's Dollar's median price is down by 66 points.
Macroeconomics Treasury 2018-01-18 09:50
On January 18th, the yuan was offered to the dollar at a median price of 6.4401 and the median price had depreciated by 66 basis points at the date of the previous transaction, ending the previous five consecutive increases.
The overnight market, the dollar warming, the dollar index out of the V-word form, as of 07:30 Beijing time, 90.89000.
According to the Federal Reserve ' s publication of the Economic Brown Book, almost all of the 12 Federal Reserve regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018, maintaining optimism about the outlook for the year.
At the same time, the unemployment rate in the United States remained at 4.1 per cent in December, the lowest since 2000, and businesses are expected to increase their wages in the coming months.
Federal Reserve officials are generally of the view that tax conversion is a factor in support of this modestly strong economic outlook, with the Fed forecasting an economic growth rate of 2.5 per cent in 2018, with an interest increase of three times.
Marketers have pointed out that, in recent times, the ECB’s monetary policy has tightened expectations to boost the euro’s exchange rate, that the dollar index has continued to fall, and that the renminbi’s exchange rate against the dollar has accordingly increased rapidly, although at present it is unlikely that the ECB will quickly adjust its policy stance, that the short-term fluctuations in foreign exchange markets will eventually return to basics, and that it is likely that the renminbi’s exchange rate will continue to function smoothly.
It is worth noting that, as the market is expected to level off against the renminbi, the attractiveness of the renminbi assets to foreign investors is becoming increasingly apparent.
The Chinese People ' s Bank of China authorized the China Foreign Exchange Exchange Exchange Centre to publish that the median value of the exchange rate of the renminbi in the interbank foreign exchange market on 18 January 2018 would be: US$ 1 against the renminbi 6.4401; US$ 1 against the renminbi 7.8482; JPY 100 against the renminbi 5.7854; HK$ 1 against the renminbi 0.82399; US$ 1 against the renminbi 8.9017; US$ 1 against the renminbi 5.1302; US$ 1 against the renminbi 4.6779; US$ 1 against the renminbi 4.8546; US$ 1 against the renminbi 6.6731; US$ 1 against the renminbi 5.1747; US$ 0.61399 against the renminbi; RMB 1 against the yuan 8.8352; RMB 1 against the yuan; South African Ryat 1.9128; US$ 1 against the yuan 165.95; US$ 1 against the yuan; US$ 0.57030; US$ 1 against the yuan of the yuan; US$ 0.57030 against the yuan of the People ' s Democratic People ' s Republic of China; KNZKN 0. 0.0.90; KNK 1 against the currency of the currency of the People ' s People ' s Democratic People ' s Democratic People ' s Republic of China ' s Democratic Republic of China ' s Republic of Korea;

What is the impact of football financial rules on Neymar's transition to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by the European Haomen Football Club will not prevent Nemal from moving from the Spanish Club Barcelona to the Paris Club of St. Germain (PSG) in France at record prices.
As a result, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has further downgraded the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris. The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is the governing body of the European football game and has the right to ban teams from participating in widely publicized Eurocap leagues.
The "Financial Fair Game Rules" (FFP) launched by the Federation of European Football Federations in 2011 means that the Paris Club of St. Germains must finally prove that Nemal's transfer will be funded without a huge loss.
The Barcelona Club has already paid €222 million ($262 million) simply to pay for the cancellation of the Brazilian player, whose salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Nemal's transfer to France.
Considering that the team is funded by the rich Qatari ruling family, the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris can certainly sign Namar in cash and include him in the ranks of other stars.
Clubs can spend a lot of money on their players, but they have to use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge amount of money they spend to balance their gains and losses in football-related business.
The Financial Fair play rules were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected president of the Federation in 2007.
According to the former French player, if banks or owners withdraw support funds for clubs that are heavily indebted for success, they are actually cheating on the risk of the club being destroyed.
In 2011, the "rule" focus shifted from club debt to club loss monitoring.
This change means that Rome? The business model used by Roman Abramovich when he acquired the Chelsea Club in 2003, namely, to buy a club with potential and then to spend a lot of money to improve the team and build a global brand, is now in a much harsher position.
During the three-year "rule" assessment period up to 2018, the club could lose 30 million euros.
Despite Abu being devalued by the current president in 2015, Aleksander Ceferin, a successor to the Federation, is still committed to stopping excessive spending.
"Of course, the rule is still in effect, and we're sure to strengthen the future statute." Andrew Traverso, who is in charge of the rule, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the St. Germain Football Club in Paris will pay Nemal ' s terms of purchase in one lump sum, it may also allocate amounts for accounting purposes within the contract period.
Nemal has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer may be shown in the annual account for the next five years at Euro44.4 million.
The first wave of "rules" imposed in 2014 brought the most severe sanctions to the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Manchester City Club under Abu Dhabi.
The St. Gilman's Football Club in Paris was fined Euro60 million (US$82 million at the time), which was reduced to Euro20 million, and demanded that the team be reduced to 21 instead of the normal 25 players in the 2014-15 season.
The Federación is looking at clubs that try to raise revenues by linking them to the owners of the clubs and deceive financial regulators.
Although Qatari companies can sponsor the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, if the amount of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price, the Federation will not consider it a legitimate income.
This was in 2014, when the Federation ruled that the Qatar Tourist Board had overestimated the amount of money that it sponsored at the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris.
It was reported that a portion of Nemar's income at the St. Germain Football Club in Paris might come from payments made by the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022.
However, both the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Organizing Committee denied that Nemal would be an ambassador to the World Cup, and such an initiative would be easy for the regulatory bodies of the Federation.
The recent sanctions imposed on the St. Germain Football Club in Paris mean that the Federation will be more vigilant about any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to Thursday's sources, there was no advance discussion with the football club of St. Germain in Paris on the transfer of Nemal.
The above-mentioned individuals contacted the Associated Press only in an anonymous capacity, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation at the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.
According to the last published accounts, the operating income of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris was Euro542.4 million in 2015-16 and more than Euro10 million in profits.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not yet been disclosed.
The Club de Football St. Germain in Paris anticipates that the Générale of Nemal will bring the evangelical benefits of sponsoring events, franchising and the sale of jerseys.
The club is expected to grow by at least 30% after the signing of Namar.
Obviously, seeing one of the most famous players leave, the Spanish Union is outraged by the attempt to block Nemal's move and claims that the St. Gilman's Football Club in Paris violates the rules.
USC President Javier Tebás told the Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of a "financial stimulant" that clubs and countries are the same", meaning Qatar, which has the ultimate ownership of the Club Saint-Girlman in Paris.
Arsene Wenger, coach of the Arsenal team, has reservations about the attitude of the state-funded club and the West Alpha league.
"This is the consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the entire ecology of the 15 years of football in the past " , Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the state owns the club, everything will happen.
This would make it very difficult to comply with the "rules", because there are many different ways or interests for a country to demand that large players represent a country. "
Robid, an intelligent interactive robot developer, has a new investment.
In recent years, start-ups in the area of artificial intelligence have continued to enjoy capital.
Artificial intelligence Rakid recently completed a new round of financing, led by Leamaszi, Swiss credit, CIDB (an investment agency under the Taiwan China Development Finance Corporation), former shareholder IDG capital, etc.
According to the information received, the size of the current round of financing is approximately $100 million, and Swiss and CIDB first appear in domestic AI financing transactions.

This round of financing will be used mainly for R & D, talent introduction, strategic push and investment layout of the industrial chain.
Prior to this, Rokid acquired IDG, linear capital, Mfund, capital $8.3 million in Angel Round Investment in August 2014; in October 2015, the company obtained Walden International Investment, with Angel investors following the $10 million A Round Investment; and on 1 November 2016, Rokid completed the financing of mixed capital, IDG, Mfund, capital, and the B Round with institutions like Walden International.
At the time, Rakid stated that the B-round post-financing valuation had reached $450 million.
In May 2017, Rokid released a consumer-grade smart voice robot, "Rocky Moonstone", combining artificial intelligence and family scenes for $1399.
This robot uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition and microphone array technology, chatting, music play, smart home functions.
Two prizes at the International Consumer Electronics Fair Tech For A Better World and Home Audio/Vidio Components and Accessors, as well as the German IF Design Award, known as Oscar in the Design Community.
On the recently closed 2018 CES, Rokid published a new product: the consumer-level enhancement reality ARGlass.com.
The glasses will be used as stand-alone head displays, i.e. without connection to smartphones or external computers, and are expected to be commercialized in 2018.

A premiere of the 3D home-painted film "Tofu Fau" 25 was held in Wuhan, with the director "Tofu Fau", the animator "Tofu Fau" imprinted on wisdom, the producer of the film and the winner of the Aimee Prize, Tom Disher, sharing on-site behind-the-scenes stories of film creation.
The story of Liu An, Han De Xiaonan, from the traditional culture of China, is based on the classic story of Liu An as tofu, which was created by mistake, and on the story of the master Doufu as an adult by a bean, who overcomes the difficulties and insists on his dream of healing the fairies. The novel is an animated film with deep roots in the local culture of Hubei.
Wudang Hill in Hubei City is one of the world's cultural heritage sites proclaimed by the United Nations and the birthplace of Dodo culture and Wudang martial arts, known as "The Ancient Triumphs, the First Fairy Mountain."
The director revealed that before the film was created, he had gone to Wudang Mountain with his team.
He said that the story of the sofa occurred in the context of the West Hanwu Emperor's time, when the film's owner, Tofu, was an unexpectedly adult-shaped bean during Liu's time.
In addition to Wudang Hill, which is the home of the Taoist culture, Hubei has a deep connection with the ancient Chinese traditional instrument, the Clock.

In recent interviews, journalists learned that in the northeast, the benefits of iron and steel, orbital traffic, ships, machinery, etc. have generally declined and even suffered losses.
Some experts were of the view that, under the current circumstances, the new round of industrial revitalization in the north-east was not only related to the economic recovery of the country, but would also have an impact on the long-term development of our manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, and that it was therefore urgent to restructure the transformation.
The general decline in business efficiency in the traditional sector, which is more costly to the raw materials industry and the manufacturing industry of heavy machinery and equipment, is a major decline and even a loss, which is the primary manifestation of the economic downturn in this round of medium- and north-east industries.
In the past, in the downside of the economy, mainly at the lower end, primary products were characterized by shocks, but this economic volatility affected both traditional and low-end industrial products in the northeast.
In previous years, the Saddle Steel Group (Webbo) had started with the restructuring of its products, focusing on the development of high-end panels such as container boards, steel tracks, shipboards and civil household panels, but sales of those varieties had declined considerably this year, especially the sales of the boards, which had fallen by 50 per cent over the same period last year.

The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25% interest rate.
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and relaxed inflation have dashed hopes of upwards.
The Bank of England warns that growth will continue to be "weak" because it controls interest rates while strengthening household incomes.
The Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers decided to maintain a 0.25 per cent interest rate with a 6-2 vote, while a few members this month called for higher interest rates, even though weak economic growth has weakened the upscaling.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced growth projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, respectively, and issued warnings that household income contraction would continue, while inflation would soar to nearly 3 per cent in the fall.
But it suggests that interest rates will need to be raised in the coming years to contain the inflation associated with Europe, while borrowing costs may need to be raised even more substantially than expected in the financial markets.
A year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented as a result of the de-European influence, and members voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the suspension of the regular financing scheme and provide low-cost funding to the banks starting next February, although the Bank claims that under the plan it will now need an additional Pound15 billion over Pound115 billion.
In the minutes of interest rate decision-making meetings, the Bank of England stated: "In the MPC ' s core projections, gross domestic product (GDP) has remained weak in the near future, as real household income contraction will continue to stifle consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "a certain monetary policy tightening" to combat inflation and to do so to a greater extent than the market expects.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year, and for the second time in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any upturn would be "slow" and "restrictive".
The Bank's growth projections for this year and next year show a downward trend, compared with the projections for May of 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank maintains a 1.8 per cent growth forecast for 2018.
The pound has declined against the United States dollar and the euro has followed.
The exchange rate of the pound has fallen by 0.5 per cent against the United States dollar, to 1.31, and by 0.4 per cent against the euro, to 1.11.
Prior to this constant decision-making, rising expectations were dashed by recent unoptimistic growth data. GDP rose to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
The bank claims that growth in the third quarter is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent, although it will increase slightly by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report by the Bank of England does not give them any good news, as it claims that austerity will get worse before it gets better.
And it says that monetary policy "can't prevent" from hitting income in the next few years, but wages are expected to recover on a massive scale by the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, owing to the depreciation of the pound sterling and the significant growth in demand for British commodities, the economy will be strained to offset some of the effects of low consumption.
One year before the decision was made, the alarming European Union referendum had caused the pound sterling to drop sharply and interest rates to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to fully influence prices and the British economy ...
Until the bank announces its latest interest rate ruling, interest rate increases will be heard, as inflation exacerbates the already stressful average household, while three policymakers call for interest rates to be raised to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9 per cent in June to 2.6 per cent last month, although the Bank of England said it was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The line is called the 2% target, and the excess is already the bottom line of the weak pound.
The director of the Coreco Mortgage Brokers, Andrew Montereyk, said, "In view of the recent fall in interest rates, the mortgage market once again seems to be becoming more competitive, as lenders strongly call for more business and look forward to a positive end for this year.
For those who may be nearing the end of their existing transactions, such a market would seem particularly beneficial, as re-collateralization (many free of charge and low interest rates) is becoming more popular.

The British National Health Service (NHS) has a big green light on controversial HIV drugs.
After the High Court's resolution of the drug financing of NHS, patients will be able to receive "transformational" HIV prophylaxis from September.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylactic drug, a pre-sexual drug, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection among high-risk populations by about 86%. Health services will now provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
It agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court ' s ruling last year. The ruling stated that, although NHS claimed that local authorities should fund the drug, NHS was entitled to pay for the prEP.
The announcement announced on Thursday was described by the British CEO of NHS, Simon Stevens, as "a major new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as "a critical moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered sexual health clinics in October, followed by full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylactic (PrEP) is an HIV drug that is administered prior to sexual activity to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Tests show that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
PEP before sexual intercourse means there's enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This drug can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexual males, transgender persons and HIV carriers who have not successfully received treatment.
The clinic will determine whether eligible participants, including men, women, transgender persons and their sexual partners, who are not known about their HIV status are receiving antiretroviral treatment.
Persons who reside and register as general practitioners in England may also enrol in their local sexual health clinics.
The program will cost £10 million, while NHS England has signed a contract to purchase these drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The experiment aims to assess the full potential of PEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr. Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and reinforce HIV prevention with a broad and increasingly successful approach.
This is another milestone in 30 years of action worth making progress in addressing the major health challenges of humankind ... "
The Chief Executive Officer of the United Kingdom AIDS Trust, Deborah King, said, "This is a crucial moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target populations in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offer the possibility of changing the UK AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, the HIV-at-risk population will gain, through NHS-funded testing in England, a new, licensed tool that is truly self-executing and that does not require consultation with sexual partners, which will bring about improvements in the lives of many people.
We agree with this announcement. "
"The priority now is to make sure that the test is spread rapidly throughout the country and that none of the people infected with HIV are left behind."
Now that we've bought PEP experimental drugs, we're ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV. "
The shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgeson claims that "after months of delay and government delays, the start of PrEP's first test was popular and should have come earlier.
Evidence shows how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This experiment will give us a better understanding of the advantages of PEP.
It is now very important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further to end the spread of HIV in society ... "

High-quality life: using attics and smart designs to make the small apartment of the Countess Palace a spacious home
Joanne Ray was a banker, and she was very keen on renovating her house, and in 2014 she moved from her big house on the Knight Bridge to a small condo at the Earle Palace.
This apartment is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne's balcony -- Joanne didn't pack her bags and sell it -- a powerful proof of the new design.
"Before that, my ex and I lived in a bigger house on Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for the right place to offer.
I saw this apartment at the Earle's Palace, and it's a very tall ceiling.
I'd like to make an offer on the same day. "
This 1,000 square feet apartment has now been completely overhauled since the first house visit.
This apartment was originally a complex one-room layout -- it needed to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- and Joanne wanted to increase the storage space and the attic to make full use of the ceiling height.
"I want tall ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's what I'm asking, "She said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azadi from the Duck&Shed architectural and design studio (in Notting Hill) to use this 12.5-foot-high ceiling to build a home that was not just a development project, but a place where Joanne lived.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two spaces up and down, so the construction challenge is to create an attic high enough to stand up.
Elvan has to think creatively to solve this problem.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We must arrange space for it to be displayed up and down, without the need for shrugs.
It's not just about building a simple platform, it's about starting up the steel so that it can be at the right level to function ... "
Through this arrangement, Ervan was able to get two rooms in the space -- a lot of interesting elements.
The penthouse uses the rectrouvius brand 's rectangular copper window to oversaw the fascinating areas of life.
Gold furniture with mirrors, little silver furniture and serge mouille resonance light laid out the whole style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Put a mirror on both ends of the hallway and make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the splatter with the mirror is like a window to another room.
At the bottom of the gate, the little grids with mirrors provide Joanne with storage space for tableware and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an attractive sense of space to put the kitchen away when it's not working.
The folding kitchen isn't fresh.
But the unique thing about this folding kitchen is a garage lift door.
"There's some engineering knowledge here. "Ellfan explains the steel-hardened-to-the-wall MDF door.
"This is a balance principle, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
Joanne got an extra 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved layout due to the clever use of space and storage.
"In the end, you sell the size of the house -- or your property is valued on the basis of the size of the house," Ervan said.
" Basically, the real estate agent would walk into the room and calculate it according to the size of the floor... "
They'll try to increase the occupied space while using high-quality materials, thus creating a sense of luxury in the space.
Elvan said, "The material was chosen by you, so it helped to create emotional bonds in the home."
"You won't love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't hold your heart. "
And it turns out, with good design and extra space, standard apartments can shake and make you wonder.
In fact, you might have chosen to live like Joanne.

26 July News: On 22 July, journalists learned from Red Bridge that the largest river belt park in the city ' s urban areas, the greening of the landscape on both sides of the South Canal in the Red Bridge area, had been completed and was open to the public free of charge.
The entire landscape belt, thanks to the pre-existing natural ecological and historical and cultural resource advantages, has been reprogrammed and upgraded on both sides of the South Canal to create five riverine landscapes along the watery green porch along the western corridor of the New Heavenly Street in Wellington Square Park.

Two brothers in the 500-million-dollar Real Estate War.
Forty years after his Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers worth more than $500 million, one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, fought for war.
The former director and developer of Carlton Football Club Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in the Tulkara district, and the three doors are at his brother's residence, Paul. The latter sued him in the Supreme Court for the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have had a heated argument about the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mothers owned 38 real estates worth more than $500 million, accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in Colin Wood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually expanded it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold it for $85 million.
At present, the De Luttis family's portfolio consists of city office buildings, the Brunswick and Solento development projects, the Golden Coast and Blue Hill apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, known by his brother Paul as the "principal protagonist and dominant figure" of the De Lutis family, owned about two thirds of the company's assets, while Paul made up about one third.
According to the documents submitted to the Tribunal, Colin owned property valued at $316 million and Paul owned property valued at $176 million.
Paul thought that the division of real estate and cash was the crux of the bargain.
" Colin ' s proposal for the division of property left him what I thought was the best property " , he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Now, the brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
Colin denied it and accused Paul of failing to manage some real estate.
In the early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed a desire to settle the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines the family as the most important option. My Italian origin determines the family as the most important " , he wrote.
The cost of the case is rising and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails, company reports submitted by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charlotte Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, top law firms, and senior lawyers engaged by both parties.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants, and they started running public restaurants and deli shops in the late 1950s and bought a store in Brenrich in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy Colin Wood's property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I was in third grade, where he founded Westco," and Paul was very young. "
Anna de Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to pass on the property to his son in peace.
" Luigi used to say to me that he never wanted his brothers to end up in court " , she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of De Lutis Group, and Colin paid Mark $10 million to leave the company and $26 million to Luke.
Paul said that Luke and Mark were both "not satisfied with the division of their property."
According to a biography published in 2015 from television star Eddie McGuire, Colin was a member of the board of directors of the former AFL Club, but he kept a low profile.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyer on Friday.
But only Colin replied by text. He said, "I can't really say much because the case has been brought to court."
" My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family business to court, which is very, very sad " , he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to satisfy his brother ' s demands.
He said, "Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like this," adding, "He still has hope for a settlement of the dispute."
Friday, the hope seems to be dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President's media time.
Others tried, but they all failed.
John F. Kelly might really be able to do it.
If that's true, then he's the first.
According to the American political news website Politico, the new White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including media reports, in order to ensure greater stability for the big boss.
The following is a quote from the journalist Josh Dauth:
"When the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he pointed out that he was trying to solve one of the main problems of President Trump's admission to the White House: bad information in the hands of the President."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the President to make better decisions, so that the message needed to be in his hands — whether in writing or in the form of a briefing.
Kelly's diagnosis looks like it, but others tried to tame it by watching Trump's media time, but eventually they all failed.
President Trump's television addiction has been going on for a long time -- now in the White House, his habits of watching TV are still growing.
In February, former campaign consultant Sam Naberg told Politico that "if the candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be helpful if he knew that he had received positive coverage through credible channels. "
"According to the experience of the six former campaign officials, the habit of controlling Trump's tweets was to ensure that the media messages he personally received always contained certain praises."
It's totally fine.
But Trump's Twitter habit of being "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something that we don't know — that if they didn't intervene, Trump's Twitter would even be even more intense.
We may never know the Twittersphere that Trump didn't send.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, even a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one can keep Trump out of contention.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, a group of competing groups, people promote their world view by delivering potentially reliable or unreliable information to Trump.
Politico -- both about this story -- reported in May on advisers' interests in providing the president with suspicious information strategically.
This is an example of what the journalist Shane Goodmancher described:
"The current and former Trump officials claim that Trump's response to negative news clips like volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive information leaks, would be crazy to try to find out where it came from.
At the end of February, the President received a malicious copy of an article on the Internet seditor Charles C. Johnson's website, GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walsh, of being the "source of mass information leaks" to the White House, as Trump had done.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned by Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had blown up a lot of false accusations and later denied them openly.
Trump read the article and started asking officials about Walsh ... "
Goodmancher also said that the then Chief of Staff, Reines Pribas, and White House Secretary Robert Potter, had tried to create a system to manage and record the documents that Trump received.
And?
Kelly's going to do the same thing in three months.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his assistant is still competing for influence.
These constant influences will make Kelly's mission more difficult.
Traveling town: how the wind gets drunk
[Summary] The potential of Zhejiang town is gradually awakened.
Now these towns are an important destination for tourists to see the water, to read the culture and to feel the pain of the country, and they will also provide an important contribution to our efforts to build the most beautiful tourist destination in China, the Poetry Zhejiang.
It's good for the wind.
"Society plays with the moon rise and weenie smells with the wind.
"The traditional craftsmanship of walking through the town of Anchanggu, where the traditional crafts of drums, bamboo-coating, iron-cracking, shoes-picking and cotton-climbing are fully illustrated, and where tourists from all walks of life are indulging in the sense of experience and historical culture.
According to the information received, during the three days of New Year's holiday, there were more than 65,000 visitors to Ancungu Town.
In Zhejiang, a small town as unique as the town of Anchanggu, Xingxiang Xiaobang, with its warm spirits flowing through the town of Gangnam, the White Wall of the 28th of the state, Deva, which talks about the end of the millennia of the ancient town, and the fishermen of Ishigang Town, Taiwan, who paint the lives of traditional and modern-day fishers ... these towns are the "baskets" of the Zhejiang tourism and the "hearts of Love" of all the tourists.
In recent years, the potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened as we move forward with the construction of our provincial tour.
In 2016, the Office of the Provincial Government officially released "The Implementation of the Creation of Tourism Townships in Zhejiang Province", offering to receive, for a period of about five years, the names of 100 or so popular towns throughout the province, with excellent ecological conditions and tourism styles.
Now these towns are an important destination for tourists to see the water, to read the culture and to feel the pain of the country, and they will also provide an important contribution to our efforts to build the most beautiful tourist destination in China, the Poetry Zhejiang.
The head of the Department of Tourism explained that, in the midst of the emergence of a tourist-friendly town, we now attach great importance to the development of the individualized tourism industry in the towns and cities of the province, and that new tourism projects and trade patterns have provided visitors with a rich experience and a good reputation.
Focus on promotion
Recently, the Zhejiang Province Tourist Board, Zhejiang Daily News Group, hosted by the All Media Center of Zhejiang Province, and hosted by Zhejiang Town X Future Artists Sharing and Poetry Zhejiang? The closing season of Zhejiang Tourist Town Hall at Zhejiang Province Exhibition.
"It's beautiful, it's warm, it's beautiful, it's warm.
The town's style is raw juice, original smell, native country, an original ecological pureness.
Experts such as Professor Xie Changfeng, Director of the Film and Animated Arts School of the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, and Professor Xu Xiao Xiao, Dean of the School of Arts and Communications of the Chinese University of Metrology, shared stories on the cross-border of small towns such as the Small Village Renovation of Small Villages in the Camera.
Many tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources, and a new town from the south of the city of Huzhou has been set up to read the country.
Gangnam's style has been popular with painters, and now the town of Nanjinggu is cooperating deeply with such art schools as the Chinese American Academy.
Tourism-friendly small-town elements, tourism elements, service elements and environmental elements.
In this context, tourism services and environments are also very important.
Rainy days with a timely umbrella will also make it easier for tourists to experience the town.
In this age of sharing, the hottest shared umbrellas of the "Poetry Zhejiang" have been custom-made by Zhejiang, the most popular umbrellas of the All Media Center for Tourist Tourist Tourist Group, hoping to promote the idea of "Share? Green" and to raise the consciousness and common sense of civilized tourism among tourists and small town residents in order to share a wonderful tourist environment.
It's one of the bright spots of the "Poetry Zhejiang? The City of Zhejiang Tourist Towns" season.
Looking forward to it.
To date, Zhejiang Province has published the first 21 provincial tourist towns created and 115 provincial tourist towns developed and created lists.
As a priority area for development during the "13th and 5th" period of rural tourism, windy towns will eventually be built up as tourist attractions above level 3A and become new models for diversity of tourism products, tourism efficiency, and industrial convergence to win.
The only thing that attracts people in this tourist town is the taste of its original juice.
The beauty of tourist-friendly towns is not only a result of the smouldering of little bridges, but also of long-standing cultural traditions; rural renewal is a result of cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the Dutch town of Lisser, the Austrian town of Halstadt, and the French town of pumpkins, with tulips, salt and pumpkins as their core attractions, attract large numbers of tourists from all over the world every year and enable tourism to boost the economy of small towns.
The focus on "Supervisión, migraine" for the windy town has given the town a distinct personality and soul, more so as to provide cultural immersion, to carry the local art, and to highlight the culture of the countryside.
Traveling small towns, bound by culture and gloom, with humans and landscapes as a vehicle, connecting tourists across the world, allowing traditional ethos and culture to be shared and innovative.
In essence, tourist-friendly small towns are complex open tourist attractions and should be shared living spaces between local residents and foreign tourists, as well as tourists.
As the main battleground for future growth in tourism, tourist-friendly towns may not only change the ecological landscape of villages, the way in which economic and social development takes place, the direction in which industrial elements flow, but also bridge the urban-rural infrastructure divide and awaken the important forces of rural cultural recovery.
The Zhejiang tourist town will be a richer story in the tide of the country's accelerated revival.
Data show that 70 per cent of China ' s travel needs are concentrated within a 3-km radius, which means that the entire short-distance travel market is a shared bicycle.

The renter negotiates the ditch and returns to Richmond Street.
Some of the richest owners of the Western Midrands region have once again been in a dispute with determined tenants who have negotiated a government-drawn ditch for the return of land other than their mansions.
The tenants parked 20 of their trailers in an open area outside of Soliher Street, which was branded Rich.
The tenants, holding the horses, carrying the babies and leading the RV convoy, returned in May, and the mounds of the city didn't stop their entry.
This lean and seasoned team found a gap in the line of defense, and although there was no roadblock to pass, their vehicles were squeezed through the gap.
Angry residents criticised the Solihull Council Commission, calling it "bad performance in dealing with the problem".
An unnamed resident said, "They arrived on Monday night, before they came to Benliches Street, throwing stones at passers-by.
The Commission should be ashamed of what they did, because they were doing nothing.
The tenants came here in May, they got kicked out, and now they're back.
There's been a lot last night. There might be more today. "
She added: "The Birmingham City Council knows how to handle it by enforcing a long-term ban to protect its park.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I'm not willing to continue paying municipal taxes if the council can't stop it.
A local resident who didn't want to give his name said, "This is ridiculous. We just saw the last group of RVs leaving, just for another group to destroy.
This time the number has increased, and some even saw horses eating grass on the park lawn. "
"We know that unauthorized camping is taking place in an open area of Schultzbrook Road, and we are now cooperating with the Soliher police and taking the necessary legal action to get them out of here as soon as possible.
In order to support us in gathering evidence, it is important that as many local residents as possible call the police to report any anti-social or criminal acts.
This will help us to outline the situation when we refer cases to the Court for the Court ' s review ... "

Italy ' s strong attitude towards the non-governmental organization Migrant Rescue Ship
Italy warned non-governmental organizations operating migration rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they would not be allowed to continue to do so unless new operational regulations were signed.
The Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, in an interview with the daily newspaper Turin, said, "It's hard to see what they're going to do if NGOs don't sign new codes of conduct."
The day before Minnity's warning, Italian officials detained a German aid organization, the crew of a ship called "Youth Rescue", on suspicion that they actually colluded with human traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operated for only one year and refused to comment on the specific subject of the charges against Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartocio.
In a social media statement, the organization said, "For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, so we regret not being able to operate in search and rescue zones. "
" After collecting all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and situations ... "
Italian officials have been watching the Youth Rescue ship since October, the Iuventa.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants brought directly from small boats by traffickers and allowing smugglers to flee in haste and re-use the ship.
According to the prosecutor's records, at least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast. The document was published by the Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which supervises rescue operations in the area out of humanitarian enthusiasm and not for any other motive ...
According to the code of conduct, ships like Iuventa clearly require an Italian officer to supervise their activities on board.
At present, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code of conduct: Save the Children, with headquarters in Malta, and Pro-Activa Open Arms, Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new provisions to be unnecessary but acceptable, as they did not bring about any "significant changes and obstacles" to its relief operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti claims that the sharp drop in the number of immigrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks indicates that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and to unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
The Minister said, "In recent days, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel."
He announced plans for in-depth talks this month: discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development activities and with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries for Europe.

A new initiative in Beijing for "school rehabilitation": thousands of students and teachers from the Northern Chemical Industry will be admitted to the new campus in Changping.
The opening ceremony of the new campus of the Beijing Chemical University was held in Changping District, Beijing, and the 1,800 acres of green campus was officially operational.
Journalists learned from the ceremony that, in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and to combat the "big city disease", in recent years, in the context of the concerted development of the capital and the defusion of non-capital functions in Kyunjin, Beijing has accelerated the dissipation of central city high schools to suburban areas, and some students and teachers of high schools are moving to suburban new campuses such as Hoyama.
The new northern chemical school complex, located in Changping south entrance town, occupies 1,800 acres, 40 kilometres from the city, and is one of the priorities of the defusion of non-capital functions in the city of Beijing.
The construction of the new school is divided into three phases, the construction of which is now complete, the construction of which is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year, and the completion of which will provide for the study and life needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and teaching staff.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and the two crowds of stars in the movie form an important part of the audience.
Today, at 1710 hours, the 119th command centre of the city of Shunyang received an alarm about a fire in the storage of tetrahydrofurans at the Hosniflu plant in Longshu Tong, in the city ' s two Qing district.
5 squadrons of 20 fire trucks with heavy chemical suits and equipment such as chemistry and digestive vehicles were immediately deployed to the scene.
After preliminary detection, fires occurred in small storage tanks where chemical substances such as tetrahydrofurans were stored, resulting in greater smoke at the site.
As at the time of press release, firefighters and police officers were under stress, city health, security, environmental protection, security, traffic, etc. were on their way to the scene and no casualties were reported.
Michelle Carter was sentenced for texting to encourage Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide by texting and telephone.
In the current year, 20-year-old Michelle Carter will be serving 15 months and may be converted to probation upon expiry, plus 5 years.
Carter was convicted in June of unintentional premeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is devastated.
My son is my best friend. "
While awaiting appeal, Carter was allowed to remain in liberty.
She's facing a maximum of 20 years in prison, but her lawyers think she and Mr. Roy are both mentally ill.
At sentencing, Carter stood up, dressed in red pants and rice coats, holding his hands tight, tears in his eyes and looking down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life for a better life.
She didn't take responsibility " , the prosecutor said.
"She doesn't have any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer says it's "a terrible consequence, she feels very sorry."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have any significant impact on her behaviour."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying, "I haven't had a day to lose my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of what I've done and what I've done... and I'm trying to stand with his sisters in all of my pain, which will accompany us forever " , stating that...
Mr. Roy's sister, Cady Roy, testified that she was "spiriting" because she realized that she could never attend her brother's wedding or become his child's aunt.
"The loss of a man who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and I will spend the rest of my life with it." She said.
This case seems to set a legal precedent, because the laws of Massachusetts do not make it a crime to encourage others to commit suicide.
Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in the car in 2014; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
After Carter's text message revealed that she encouraged him to commit suicide, the case drew national attention.
"Handed, jumped, stabbed herself in a lot of ways... " she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family.
During the time before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," and, "All you have to do is start the generator and then get free and happy."
Judge Monez said that Carter had drawn attention through the death of Mr. Roy and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are differences of law in this case.
One of the few people defending Carter, Amanda Knox, who was charged with the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007, was acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Ms. Knox, in a column published by the Los Angeles Times, said, "Michel? Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment."

The director-general of the Lassard Netsat Basketball Club, Liang Joon, told reporters that the team's performance had improved compared to last year, and that there had been a marked improvement in the self-confidence of the players and their confidence in the field.
At the end of the game, Captain Jiangtsang said he wanted to gain experience by participating in the game and to do his best for the Tibetan basketball cause.
It is understood that in the Beijing game, players overcome factors such as low-altitude intoxication and display the image of Tibet.
Although the track is a gold medalist at the Olympics and the tracker gets the world, the track name will be the bottom.
Automotive manufacturers are hit, and Audi will convert up to 850,000 diesel vehicles.
Audi announced that the BMW would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 cars the day before the conversion.
BMW Chairman said that BMW believed that "driving with more intelligent choices than limits" meant that major cities in Europe -- including Munich, where BMW had its headquarters -- were considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe would be converted to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed that this was a recall.
European automobile manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions requirements.
But nitrogen oxides emitted from diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel vehicle tail gas emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As German car manufacturers faced scrutiny, the government led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel was accused of over-exercise of these powerful car companies and ignored the signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the popular pattern of covering up the use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations during vehicle tests and returning to normal driving conditions.
Several public executives have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacero Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected by extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a public German criminal investigation, and the German government accused Audi of installing a system to avoid European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi's being investigated could have a significant impact on the public: luxury car manufacturers have a disproportionate share of the profits of public cars ...
It's been a year or two or even years since a film was prepared for and presented.
The animated film, the Big Fish Seagull, announced its launch on July 8, 12 years from the time of its preparation to the time of its launch!
The original author of the Big Fish Seagull, Liang Xinghua University, 21 years old, founded the Black Sea with his best friend Zhang Chun. In 2008, he received a million dollars worth of venture capital from the joint venture, and launched an animated film, the Great Fish Seagull.
The film has won many national and international prizes during the creative sample phase, and has been recorded and praised as one of the most outstanding works of art by the contemporary art centre of Pompidou, France.
For six years, from creativity to production, the film was called the "Purpose of God" by millions of fans looking forward to it.
Big Fish Seagull tells a fairy tale that belongs to the Chinese, and with the release of this pre-scheduled film, it brings new expectations to all viewers.
He said, "This is the only thing I've done in 12 years, and now it's become a dream, and I'm nervous and excited."
Zhang Chun says, "I'm driving the team crazy thinking about using one-fifth of the other's budget to do exactly the same thing as the others."
Dong-jung, a world factory that used to rely on raw materials and a large number of generalists, is looking at high-quality people who can lead the repositioning of the city.
During the high-level talent event week organized by the City of Dongjung in recent days, the first financial reporter saw a number of powerful local businesses participating in the talent fair.
On the orange-red-back wall, which is a very bright billboard, they each mark a price.
Therefore, the Chinese Association of Television Production Industries decided to join the national television production industry and sign a convention on self-regulation.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but there is bad news that it is threatened by climate change.
As a result of persistent drought and the presence of viral insects, lavender is declining, causing headaches among scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute of Agriculture in Provence, says: "The lavender of Provence is under great threat because in recent years the plant has been affected by climate change, spring rains have declined significantly, and the autumn has been drenched.
It affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a small individual twig, a leaf twig that can spread micro-bacterial bacteria, and in very dry weather they appear in large numbers ... "
The point is it's huge.
In addition to attracting vacationers, Qingya's lavender has been promoted by the perfume and cosmetics industries.
Eric Chase says, "Contrary to the many big flowers that can be planted with long valleys, we have problems with small, stunted, missing or weak individuals.
That's why we have less oil. "
The solutions being studied include the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the mitigation of evaporation of soil moisture, the spraying of a protective mixture of clay and water on a plant, and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
It's the story of the film that attracts them more than the science fiction element of the film.
On the afternoon of 5 September, the Washington City Journal reporter, who continued to interview a number of prominent voices, as well as two vocal artists, was surprised to learn that they were virtually silent.
One was the Berlin Film Emperor, one was an up-grading young actor, and "Psychiatry" was the first partner of Liaofan and Li Yi Feng.
Mexico is in danger. Journalists are killed.
The staff of the Riodoce weekly usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the riots in Sinalo, which were caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today, the shadow of tragedy looms over themselves, and they come together to discuss security issues.
They're told to change their daily habits. It's important.
Two senior journalists discussed what was more safe: whether their children should be brought to the office (which had been hit by a grenade in 2009) or whether they should be left at home.
The security expert wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemy, neutral and ally.
They put the reporters under each column -- without evidence, observation and intuition are enough.
Suspected drug dealers on government lists, politicians, businessmen and journalists, or cartels, these thugs make Mexican reporting dangerous.
The violence has continued and the country has seen a growing number of dead, including journalists: according to the Commission for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection following attacks and threats; at least 7 journalists have died in seven states so far this year.
The last person who died was their editor and inspiration, together with Javier Valdez Cárdenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdiz wrote a lot of books about drug violence, and he wrote in one of them: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."
You can feel that he's gone, though he's everywhere -- a huge picture on the front of the Riodoce office building, with a middle finger and the word "justice" in it; two 30-year-old journalists, Aaron Ivala and Miriam Ramirez, wearing a T-shirt, with his smile on his glasses or his branded Panamanian straw hat.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their common wounds, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists ' cases, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the office prosecuted only two persons.
The vast majority of the thousands of crimes committed each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so the perpetrators of the killings of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they insist on reporting the violence in Sinalo, though they're heartbroken, even though the land is full of holes.
Ivala said that without information about the killer and justice, it wouldn't be very useful to have a security seminar.
He said, "Wasting time for a seminar like this is stupid.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone. "
On the morning of May 15, Valdiz left the office of Riodoce in the capital city of Culiacan.
His red Toyota Carola drove a few blocks away and was stopped by two men; they forced him to get out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the newspaper's name, which translates into the 12th River.
The thugs left in his car and crashed it in the vicinity.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two grown-up children behind.
There's a rumor about Culiacan.
But there's nothing but silence about Valdez.
Since Guzmán was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battles in the country.
One or more people are shot every day in the streets of Sinaloa, and the graves are filled with two voracious tombs of drug lords, which are commonplace.
For the time being, the state of calm is when only one cartel controls the coastal state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdiz was well aware of the dangers of the job, the 60-year-old "Riodoce" co-founder and director Ismail Pohokwe was guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believed that two mistakes had led to this tragedy.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damasso Lopez, who led a cartel that fought against Guzmán's sons.
The story may have provoked the boys; the newspapers were bought by suspected gang members as soon as they arrived at the newsstand.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper that reported the same story was confiscated.
Valdiz was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death was of great importance to Mexico ' s violence against journalists.
His spirit is long and his friends and colleagues believe he's always with us.
He was also a senior journalist for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues in the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 dollars in shares.
Pohoqui says, "In Sinalo, there's no way the news industry can stop dealing with drugs."
With the passage of time, the newspaper has gained a good reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising have increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish reports about what's at stake without fear of censorship, and readers like to publish stories in newspapers that other people don't dare to report.
Five years after its creation, Riodoce won the Maria Moskapo Prize for Latin American News.
The same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdiz International Prize for Press Freedom in recognition of his courage to pursue the most authentic Mexican drug story.
He said he was scared, too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the prize, he said, "I want to live."
Later in October, in an interview with the local television station Rompetiento TV, he said, "Drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinalo.
You must assume the task of falling on you as a reporter -- either that or being deaf or dumb.
I don't want to be asked, "Why don't you make a sound about what's happening in the face of so many deaths?"
All the staff of Riodoce miss Valdez, remembering him cursing like a dock worker, remembering a friend who never hesitated to embrace and advise, miss a teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar across from the office, always sitting on the same table.
Now, they will ask: Is it his daily habits that caused him to crash?
His death also forced them to think about how to do their job and live their lives.
"They don't like you causing trouble to their women and children, and they don't like you influencing their legitimate companies and secret airports used to transport drugs."
It's all over their bottom line. "
The result is to maintain a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection, even in the safest of times.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell dangerous, get out of here.
The editor of Riodoce, Andrés Villariel, said, "The breath is a feeling of deception... and then something like that happens to Javier."
He and others have said that the previous rules no longer apply to Sinalo -- just as they no longer apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes are lucrative and institutions are weak, government officials corrupt and smug.
The situation is changing.
In the room where Riodoce's employees were participating in security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed; a few days ago, spy software allegedly sold only to the Government had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took the cold under the shade and fled from the temperature of 104 degrees Celsius.
They were sent by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce, located in a four-story building in the middle class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters joke about the fact that these cops are not 50% of what the governor says they are.
It's been months since journalists went to the mountains, where drug cartels were under real control.
This week's Riodoce featured three major stories.
Among them was the murder of the brother of Julio Cesar Chávez, a great former boxer in Sinalo County.
There is also a disclosure of government funds from the governor's hometown.
And the kidnapping in a expensive restaurant in Culiacan, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
There is no official information about the abductees and the kidnappings, so writing about what the city knows needs to be careful: the restaurant is a place where drug dealers and the authorities love to go.
A journalist learned from the public record that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling Revolutionary System Party (PRI), which dominated the political class almost throughout the past.
Recently, several Revolutionary System Governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Villariel asked journalists to write about what happened at the scene of the incident, including the escape of one of the sons of Mexico's biggest drug lord, Guzman, from a military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would look at Valdez's column and look for the most powerful information on the kidnapping.
46-year-old Valerille, who was called "Little Man" because he had a thin body, said, "We already knew what was going on before.
Now all our sources of communication have been cut off.
Valdiz’s office is now being used to store signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists, because the employees are what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, a journalist, Miriam Ramirez, took a sign and took it out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to attend a march in connection with another journalist.
El Salvador Adamé disappeared in Michoacán in the west three days after Valdez was killed.
Officially, a burnt body was discovered and claimed to be his body according to DNA tests.
All over the country, journalists became more forthright, organized protests and put the word "save the media" on sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, Director Pohokwe is not in Washington, and he's trying to get justice and international support for the Valdiz case.
The day after Valdiz was killed, in a meeting with the Governor of Sinalo County, Ramirez complained about the official spying on journalists and killed them because they had told the truth.
Since her anger had affected her objectivity, she also asked to resign from reporting on government matters.
Valdiz has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are being organized to commit crimes, surrounded by government officials and disinterested societies.
In his last book, "Drug News", he wrote that journalists were not only mutilated by drug cartels, but were on the list of politicians and security forces who were involved in organized crime.
Media Watch Group Articulo 19 blames police and public officials for more than half of the attacks on journalists last year.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up."
Apparently, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, Bo killed Maria Elizabeth Macias at the border north of Tamaulipas.
Her body was accompanied by a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I came for my story."
Her head was cut off with a computer keyboard and headphone.
After Miroslava Brech was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close, like El Norte on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others are still on, and the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo were killed in 2014, but they are still on.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front page of a public conversation about the drug cartel, entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their homes or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It's hard to find jobs in exile, and they still have to be careful and watch out for danger in the streets.
Sometimes they were arrested and reportedly killed in 2015 by cameraman Ruben Espinosa with four women in a Mexican city three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who work behind the scenes, it's a routine dance for high-risk decision-making.
Eva wanted to be a poet, and he admitted reporting on the drug trade scared him.
He said, "Mexican's turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
In the middle of the last Friday, the latest edition of the newspaper was printed, and the editors of Riodoce sat outside the office drinking beer, and suddenly their phone rang.
A series of gunfights between gang rival forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Massatland has confirmed 19 deaths.
The war is escalating, as a series of cartel information has been discovered in the region.
They uploaded the news to Riodoce's website on the side of the road via their cell phones.
The next day's headline had to be changed.
The sirens are ringing in the vicinity -- there's another shootout in the area.
Pohokwig glanced at the police officers standing there to see if they were alert.
If they're scared, they don't show up.
The founder of this newspaper is dead, and in his large portrait, he points to the places where the entire Sinalo State needs to look, and the staff of Riodoce follows him.
"How could you even want to shut down? The day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her on the street."
China ' s own-car tourism market size or trillion yuan in 2020
[Summary] In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-travel is encouraged by national policies and increasingly popular among consumers.
But at the same time, there is a double challenge ahead of a trillion-scale self-driving market.
In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-tourism is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly favoured by consumers.
At the same time, however, there is a double challenge to a trillion-dollar self-driving market, with self-driving industries developing in ways that do not match market demand, and self-driving organizations such as auto-driving clubs and travel agencies facing a low-profit dilemma, while self-driving infrastructure and services are still at an early stage.
60% of the total number of people in the country, and the market is expected to break by trillion.
In 2016, domestic tourism was 4.44 billion times, and self-travel accounted for about 60 per cent of the total number of domestic tourism trips, and the size of the self-carriage market is expected to break out of trillion by 2020.
According to the statistics of the China Touring Boat Association on the number of people travelling in and out of their own car, the number of people travelling has continued to grow over the past five years, and the proportion of people travelling in and out of the country has remained stable at over half.
At the same time, regional and national levels have shown greater interest in and support for the emerging field of self-driving, with policy and regulations relating to self-driving, residential and camping tourism heavily developed from 2016 to 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Directorate of Tourism, the National Directorate of Sport and Sports, jointly issued the "Development Plan for Automobile Sports Camps" and in the same month, self-travel was highlighted in the "Action Programme for the Promotion of the Development of Precursors of Rural Tourism (2017)" issued jointly by 14 departments, such as the CSD, the Ministry of Finance.
The introduction of policies provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving.
The self-drive club has little profit, and the whole industry chain is the key.
Despite the enormous potential of the domestic self-driving market and the positive direction of national policies, the self-driving industry is still in its early stages.
According to the Annual Development Report for China ' s Tour 2016 - 2017, there are thousands of auto clubs, car clubs, car clubs, etc., but tourist self-help arrangements account for a large proportion of travel by themselves, participating in car clubs, and travelling clubs and other institutions such as auto clubs account for only about 15% of visitors.
At the same time, the number of online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies that have autonomously developed self-carriage products is limited. Many online tourism platforms sell only self-carriage products from suppliers and some self-carriage clubs are important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-drives, it covers "eat, live, walk, swim, buy, have fun" in a variety of ways, with high fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chains, and high random tourist consumption.
The founder and CEO of the Beijing Car Club and CEO Li Congjie believe that the self-drive club is essentially similar to the travel agency, and that the main profit model of the early days was based on offline activity, with the core being the self-drive line product and lead service.
But now that there is a high degree of homogenization of line products in the self-drive sector, the level of leadership services varies, and the self-drive clubs face the need for a new transformation.
As can be seen, self-driving is not an independent industry in itself, but rather a trans-geographic, industry-based cycling that is important to form a complete chain of industry.
Experts noted that, in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important element of consumption.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving industry, it is important to enhance the empirical identity, develop the theme of self-driving plus and IP for self-driving products.
The landscape is not just a road. Car camps should not be just for room and board.
In the face of the rise of self-driving, the basic development of self-driving is also relatively basic.
According to Li Congjie, tourist attractions are not only a road but rather a need to integrate the elements of transport and tourism into them, but road repair and tourism itself are the responsibility of both sectors, the transport sector increases the elements of tourism, and the construction of latrines, counselling centres, publicity boards, etc., is not sufficiently integrated with tourism.
The construction experience is worth learning by comparing the well-known autopilot route, the 66th Highway of America.
The landscape design is no longer the most direct and rapid route between the place of departure and the destination, but is guided by the design concept of "exercise the pleasure of driving" and provides the best enjoyment for self-carried tourists of the beauty of the road. The landscape is able to connect points and face-to-face tourism landscapes, preserving historical and cultural values of ecotourism resources along the route, and organizing thematic events to enhance the participants' participatory and travelling experiences and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the landscape, the camp is an important side-facilitating facility.
But among the self-traveling tourists that New King reporters know, there are few consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
In their view, many camps are in favour of infrastructure and can only satisfy food and shelter, low grades and a single product, which does not meet the need to travel on its own with many elements.
According to some unnamed businessmen, many of the businesses that had been in the camps in previous years were to take land, and after taking land, the later stages of infrastructure construction and services were not kept up, many of the operations were at a loss, and it was difficult to do the same without the later infusion of funds.
Consumption group
According to data published in 2017 by the China Touring Boat Association, self-driving groups are concentrated in 21-40 years of age, especially those aged 31-40, with a certain economic base and a high demand for individualized tourism, mostly as parent-to-child travel clients, by age.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-driving population is relatively more inclined to prefer non-standard accommodation.
In terms of the type of auto-drive, auto-driving is the most important type of auto-driving, 84.32 per cent.
You know, it's a lot of people who want to leave, but it's a lot smaller.
At the same time, with rising consumer demand, visitors who used to like to drive their own tourist attractions began to change their mind, not "get out and take pictures and sleep in the car" in the course of their own trips, but rather focus more on the experience and the process of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguises to hide from their enemies.
At first glance, it's scary, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers published their first study of the incredible biochemicals found by Canadian miners, which, according to the researchers, were well preserved and were therefore referred to by experts as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
The fossil is very well preserved, and it can even be determined that the colour of its skin is red brown.
The story in Contemporary Biology described it as "the best preserved picature dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of pulmonary dragon that lives between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the white age.
It's extremely well preserved, shocked researchers, who describe it as "exaggerable."
According to the National Geographic, this herb-painted dinosaur is the best-saved and best-saved dinosaur fossil ever found.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered this fossil during a mining operation at the Senkol Millennium Summit near McMurley Fort, northern Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he ran into something that seemed different from the surrounding rock, and he decided to look at it carefully.
After that, the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Museum of Life in Tyrell, Canada.
It took six years for the researchers to show the real face of this beast inside the 2500 pounds (1,100 kg) of earth.
After all this hard work, the final results are now being announced.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Terrill Museum, the first author.
"It will be one of the most beautiful and well-saved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world. "
By studying its skin, researchers found that the herbivores, while wearing armor, were like walking tanks, were at risk of major threats from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The dinosaurs in heavy armor use red and white disguises to escape predators and covert techniques known as "deshade", which are also used by many modern animals.
In this way, the experts said it could be better integrated with the surrounding environment, thus avoiding the enemy, indicating that it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature is part of the family of Lumpy Dragons, which became the headline for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Terrill Biology Museum.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was a member of the team, and after seven hundred hours of careful lifting of the beast's veil, the researchers now study it and call it "Borealopelta marktelli".
The samples were extremely well preserved, allowing Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists to record the patterns and shapes of the scales and coats on their bodies.
They discovered the anti-shade technique, a common defense in the animal world, which means that the animal's back is darker than its side.
Although anti-shade techniques are common, the results are surprising because the dinosaurs are much larger than the existing animals that use anti-shade.
The dinosaurs are under pressure to be hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs, which evolves in a favourable direction, allowing them to hide in the cross-base as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing anti-shade animals, such as deer, zebra or zebra, are as small and vulnerable as prey, indicating that the creature is under real survival pressure.
"The wild hunting of large heavy-demons shows how dangerous it is for white-coloured meat-eating dinosaurs." Brown says.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin color is red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life clues of the creature, including its stomach content, to find the last food to eat.
In their view, dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of death, were then washed into the sea and then sank in a back-down way into the sea.
At that time, Alberta's climate was as warm as it is today in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans could be deeper inland than they are now.
Brown says, "The Lumpy Dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered by the staircase of its preserved skin and, to this day, preserved in its dimension, so that its original shape can be preserved."
"So the creature now has almost the same shape as the white age.
You don't need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping. "
The time of chalking is a time when giant animal foot dinosaurs walk on Earth.
Although the Tyrannosaurus is the king of the dinosaurs, it only appeared a few million years after the Piranzosaurus, which could have been captured by some of the Tyrannosaurus' ancestors.
They include a high-crested dragon, a giant beast weighing 6 tons long, 38 feet long, 11.5 metres long.
The latest research found that scientists in Contemporary Biology believed that nodes were washed into the sea after their death, and that mummies were formed in the mud.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink dug up the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurley, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it's the world's best preserved picature dinosaur, with complete skin and armor in the area from the nose to the hips.
This creature is about 18 feet long (5m) and weighs 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It's got two 20 inches long, sharp corners from the shoulder.
According to researchers, this herb-painted dinosaur operates in the current western part of Canada and is then washed into the sea by a flood of rivers.
But this dinosaur is buried on the bottom of the sea to keep his coat intact.
The remains of this special sample are very well preserved, so that the remaining skin still covers the punctuated pieces of the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, this preservation is very rare, just like the middle color.
The more I look, the more I find it incredible.
Residue skin fossils are still covered in the coats of armor that are glossed over the skulls of dinosaurs.
Its right front palm is on its side, with five toes up.
I can count it. "
Journalists learned that adding natural or plant-based kelp acids, corrosion acids and amino acid efficiency vehicles to urea production processes could lead to a change in the efficiency of traditional urea, resulting in urea for kelp, zinc corrosion urea, and a 5-10 percentage point increase in the use of urea for cereal urea compared to general urea.
Environmentally friendly, with a clear potential for increased crop yields, especially large particle value-added urea, which is a good material for BB fat.
This total number of security personnel is twice as high as the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympics.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security connection ever.
Previously, the Brazilian Government had indicated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and the police, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 policemen, would work together.
The majority of the military will be responsible for the protection of Olympic stadiums, while the additional 3,000 will be responsible for security at international airports, metro stations and streets.
The police patrol the rest of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
According to the information received, 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio to provide security for the Olympics.
They are responsible for patrolling the airport and the main road connecting the airport to the Olympic complex, in addition to the four major areas of the Rio Olympic Games.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is no longer new, and for evaluation mechanisms to be effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and less formal.
How radicals learn to answer this question: "Whose street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was disturbed.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, this St. Louis man sat on Episode's rent bed, browsing Facebook on his cell phone.
She accidentally found a post from a high school student.
It says, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid who was lying on the street."
She found no one else to post the message, and she was confused. She turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A @TheePharaah user kept pushing her for the Dynamic Times.
Michael Brown was an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He put a picture of Brown's body lying on the street with his vital signs, and his body was lying on the street for four hours.
"Drave," Ferrer thought.
But death is not new to her and her community.
She dropped her phone and didn't turn on her Twitter until the same night to read the tweets about the crowds on Canfield Boulevard.
There's a police video and a photo of people screaming, and there's a photo of a man who claims to be Brown's father, and it says, "Policies Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed that a policeman stood in front of a crowd of protesters with a barking dog.
She said in another video, another cop raised his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all of you...
"It's not normal," said Ferrer in his memory.
"It's not what we're used to, it's what we call a typical murder."
At that moment, I felt chilly.
I'm angry and I'm crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
When she landed at 11:00 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrer and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary on "Who's Street"?
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of those who live in this community and are crowded with streets and alleys demanding answers.
When Ferrer drove to Ferguson with her daughter (in a flower dress, wearing a coronation), they re-discussed the topic that they had discussed many times before that morning -- "About black experience and black status."
"Do you remember when I taught you when black men had to fight for their faith?"
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is wrong.
I had to take her with me, after "Freyer."
"What happened today is the climax of everything in the past.
She needs to know, see and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop well in radicalism and organizational aspects, but also to understand the different dimensions of black experience and black status and what we have to do to be free and free.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with a racist experience she had not experienced personally, she was no different from any other black girl.
If I protect her in this matter, I think I'm hurting her. "
The first stop at Ferguson was at a site opposite the South Florence police station, and the militants waited for the final outcome of Officer Darren Wilson's failure to prosecute, and the site became their camp.
Ferrer and her daughter are in contact with a local business owner who's making lunch in a bag.
They've got a bag. They'll pass it to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new kind of activism.
She said, "My radicalism changed completely after August 9th." "When she was studying at St. Louis, Missouri State University, she was president of the Association of Nurses and Students of Minorities, focusing on the gap between food justice and health in the black community.
"I don't have organizational experience.
That's how it all came. "
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with film co-director Sabah Fryyan in a night march.
Fryyan said she and her photographer Lucas Alvarado Falle "just wanted to record what happened."
One of the questions that came up in Ferrer's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many cases in which people, usually whites, enter a community to benefit from their pain and resilience.
As Fryyan explained in his last interview, "We heard that native people in Ferguson did not concentrate their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."
Fryyan has contacted co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism against death row prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrer to join with six other locals in the "Who's Streets?" project team, which remained in place for years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone talking to us or talking to us, it's what we say. " Davis says.
"I'm concerned about how these people are presented, because that's the way I'm being presented. "
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrer's experience — it's to show that the movement is not about the Savior's leader, but about community cohesion — Fryyan says — she's proved to be the most open of film participants.
And as a result, "Who's Street?" is an amazing record of Ferrer's personal life, like falling in love and getting married.
"I feel naked, "Freyer laughed when he first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that to do this and to humanize black people, a certain degree of vulnerability is necessary..."
Moreover, Ferrer's story reaffirms and repositions the role of black cool women in the wider black life event movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- the creation of #BlackLivesMutter on social media following the 2012 shooting of a black teenager, Trevor Martin -- were found to be cool.
"Black cool women in leadership generally support this movement," said Ferrer, "that's because we're fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women must endure this. "
Fryyan agreed and said, "This movement is really supported by black women and a lot of black cool women."
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen to be at the heart of the film.
"She's the one who stimulates this energy," she said.
"She's on the front line, but it's not a coincidence, because in these crossroads, as a black cool woman, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy. "
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long disappeared, but ethnic tensions between the community and the police persist.
As a result of an attempt to block the highway during a demonstration, Ferrer was given a suspended sentence of over two and a half years.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in what she called home: "A mess."
Nevertheless, since she went to Ferguson's street three years ago, she has been insisting on the holy song she tried to remember.
"It is our duty to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We can no longer afford to lose except the shackles of our bodies. "
In fact, an online translation service had been available 10 years ago, and it was a long time ago that the argument that machines were about to replace humans for translation had been heard.
Similarity: Artists use Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
There are multiple faces in the center of the museum in Friedman, New York: white, black and brown, with almost undetectable similarities between each face, bound by the ropes drawn down from the ceiling.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Duvey Hagborg using Chelsea Manning's cheek tampons and hair scraps.
Manning sent hair chips from Livingworth Fort Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking confidential diplomatic telegrams via WikiLeaks website.
The exhibit was opened on August 2nd under the title "Similarity".
This is the result of two years of communication between Dewey Hargerburg and Manning, Dewey Hargerburg, who combines his discipline with his own technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a well-known dissident, who went to prison and completed a sex reassignment surgery in prison.
And by doing the algorithmic analysis from Manning's DNA, and by creating 30 portraits of "exceedings very likely," Heather Duway Harborg made a very sharp and somewhat heartless comment, which was about both the carelessness of DNA and the concept of identity itself.
Manning was born with the name Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted that she was a woman at puberty... Convicted in 2013 and involved 20 charges, including 6 espionage offences, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was repressed, with only one photograph, a photo of herself with a grain of pellets, apparently uneasy, sitting on the driver's seat, wearing a golden wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Harborg had a great success in her 2012 project, "The Face of Strangers."
In that work, she used DNA taken from cigarette butts and gums of medium court evidence, from scraps, to create portraits of possibly similar 3D characters.
That's an e-mail she just got from PaperSmart magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait " , Heather Dewey Hubberg said to the press at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn't visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
So this artist and her imprisoned muse became impossible pen friends and exchanged many letters over two years.
They even created a comic book, "Depressed Head", by Shoili Kanungu, which envisaged that the president would grant Manning privileges in the future and that she would be able to see the exhibition in prison.
And Obama asked for her release just a few days after the publication of the book, which may be a coincidence, when Manning spent the seventh year in Kansas Military Prison.
In addition, this exhibition has another meaning. Because in modern America, the Trump government has been constantly declaring war on government leakers and transgender soldiers, while finding new ways to brazenly incite division in a way that can be tweeped on Twitter, and this exhibition is about bridging the divide.
When asked all this special time, Heather Duway Harborg said, "Anything happens for a reason."
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's super-large signature is down there, calling for an end to the "sympathic images of parties based on gender, sexual orientation and culture."
The opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, written with pencils twisting Cs, Gs and As symbols.
With 200 letters (or nucleic acids, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Duway Harborg wants to express itself, at least in the physical structure, by drawing these amazingly similar portraits.
"I hope our genome doesn't care who we are, how our open genetic data are interpreted, how subjective it is," said Heather Duway Harborg, whose 2007 video "False Memory" was also on display.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, so this is 30 of them."
The last piece in the exhibition, in a room, came from a page in a novel in an illustration.
The American soldiers exaggerate under the loudspeaker, the Manning of the Golden Kong.
"When they stop your speech, they win." It says on the wall.
"So don't shut up."
"This came directly from a letter she wrote to me. " The artist from Philadelphia said.
"I'm afraid again, and I'm still going to say it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition herself, as foreseen in the comic book, but when she does, she'll have her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters cheering in the center of the gallery.
It's also purposeful, just like all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of the genetic monotonous information she wrote in pencils (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"In the past, I put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a bunch of people," Dewey Hagburg said when he spoke about portraits.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting against her release. "
Professor at Northwestern University and staff at Oxford University are wanted for murder.
According to the police, a man was found to have been fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago, and a Northwestern university professor and an Oxford university employee were subsequently wanted and are currently searching for suspects throughout the country.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Windham Lacem and 56-year-old Andrew Wallen were arrested for the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranlo for murder without bail in the first degree.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell Duranlo died from multiple stab wounds.
According to a community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27.
The police got a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment and found several fractures on the victim.
According to the police, Cornell Durandro died on the spot, the detective was investigating the murder, and the police were actively looking for two suspects.
Lesam has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, the Deputy Director of Campus Relations, Alan K. Cobbage, stated that Lessem had now been dismissed and had been denied access to the University of the North West campus.
Kobaki said, "It's a criminal case now, and the authorities are investigating it, and the University of Northwestern is actively cooperating in the investigation."
Warren's a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
"We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist U.S. investigative agencies as required. "
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would turn himself in.
Anthony Gulermi, Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, has strongly encouraged suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Gulermi says, "The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we're trying to locate possible locations."
Gulermi indicated that local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search of suspects.
Gulermi stated that the police had received a call from the manager of Grand Plaza's apartment, and that he had just received a secret tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police said it was terrible.
Gulermi says it's still unclear whether this incident also occurred on July 27.
He said that according to the security cameras, it was confirmed that Lesam and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Lessem has something to do with the victim."
Grand Plaza ' s management team issued a statement to the residents that: "The police are currently studying the victim ' s timeline and circumstances, and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident. "
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Muteko said, "We will complete the road map for the world anti-doping agency in the near future."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Muteko stated that the implementation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) residual criteria for the restoration of the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSDA) would not take too long.
"The implementation of the road map standards has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA Road Map has been updated in this regard.
Deputy Prime Minister Muteko made the above statement in his comments on the second part of the road map of the World Anti-Doping Agency, Compliance. This part sets out the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and was recently posted on the organization's website.
According to Muteco, the criteria do not contain anything that might be of concern to Russia.
And he added, "Everything has to be announced, everything will be done.
The results will be submitted to the IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future. "
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti-doping agency must publicly accept the findings of the investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard MacKaylen on WADA ' s state support for the use of stimulants in national sports ...
Speaking of this, Muteco said, "We're investigating that our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not admit what does not exist ... "
Muteko's words echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian public anti-doping committee.
Smirnov acknowledged the problems of the Russian anti-doping agency in the past when he was interviewed by the media earlier that day, but added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnov says.
After the November 2015 stimulant scandal, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to carry out stimulant screening in Russia.
But in June of this year, the RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
The Director-General of WADA, Olivia Negrey, when he visited the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, said that RUSADA was "going in the right direction" and trying to restore its rights.

In an interview, Croatian FIFA President Davo-Suk said that participation in the Chinese Cup was very interesting for Croatian football, and that the number of prizes for the Chinese Cup was very high.
No more surrogates! These more than 8,000 products are duty-free.
At a regular press conference organized by the Department of Commerce on 11 January, the Ministry of Commerce press spokesman had the opportunity to state that, to date, there were 15 FTAs in force in our country, covering 23 countries and territories, covering more than 8,000 duty-free imports.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, tropical fruits of ASEAN... these products you want are no longer purchased at great cost.
At present, 16 free trade agreements have been signed with 24 countries and territories and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 products imported at zero tariffs.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers are able to taste agricultural products of good quality and good quality from different origins every quarter of the year.
For example, in ASEAN, tropical fruits such as durians, twigs and falcons, import tariffs are reduced from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
Tariffs on Icelandic salmon imports were reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
(a) Red wine in Georgia and Chile, where import tariffs are reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
New Zealand's special agricultural products, such as beef and milk powder, are subject to substantial tax cuts.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, part of the import of cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero;
(b) A 50 per cent reduction in duty duties on selected watch imports, which will be reduced to zero in a few years;
Korea ' s imports of products such as refrigerators, cooking pans, massage machines and beauty machines have been reduced by 40 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years ' time;
And consumer-type electronics, for example, have larger tax cuts.
At the same time, tariff-free products under the FTA include intermediate products and raw materials for the manufacture of many domestic final consumer goods, which have contributed to some structural upgrading of domestically produced consumer goods.
According to the Ministry of Commerce press spokesman, the country ' s total imports of nearly one third of its products are subject to preferential tariff treatment under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Goods, most of which are end-of-life consumer goods, with tangible benefits for consumers.
Further reduction of tariffs on imports of consumer goods
With effect from 1 December 2017, we have adjusted our tariffs on imports of some consumer goods, further reducing the tariffs on imports of consumer goods, covering food, health care products, medicines, daily products, shoe caps, household equipment, cultural entertainment, and various types of consumer goods such as groceries, for a total of 187 tariff numbers.
The average tax rate for this consumer product will drop from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost to be cut off!
We have also partially adjusted our customs duties on other imports and exports since 1 January 2018.
(b) The tariff on imports of cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow and perfume has been reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
Lowering tariffs means that consumers don't have to buy, let alone go all the way out to buy their favorite foreign products.
2018 U.S. Imported Merchant Festival: Imported wine, snacks, fruits... all cheap!
Exterior: At the end of the year, U.S. malls are very different.
China-New Network December 29th.
According to the American Daily News, just after Christmas, there's a retreat.
According to the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), more than half of the goods sold last Christmas were re-sold.
In addition, readers are being cheated on multiple web shoppings, and consumers need to be careful when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but when buying gifts or electricity from small shops, they must be careful.
Ms. Ho of Langon bought a coat on December 1st at an online shop specializing in stamp jackets for 60 grand, and it hasn't arrived yet.
She e-mailed the guests and didn't reply.
There's also information about a trip to the United States last year to buy a cell phone from a third-party seller, which was sent and found to be a box of rubber mud.
If you know you've been tricked, apply to the website for a refund, so you can get a full refund.
But there are customers who believe that the website refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. King, a Chinese resident in Northern California, said that he had bought two emergency distribution services for a website, four dollars for an emergency service, but never delivered it on time.
And then I applied for a refund, and I didn't get a reply.
Big malls or shopping malls have better return policies.
Most of Macy's merchandise is fully refunded within 180 days.
However, the goods must remain as they were and there must be purchase vouchers such as receipts or bank purchase records.
In the absence of a certificate, the customer may also obtain a market score that can be used to purchase other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for ordinary commodities, usually electronics for 15 days.
However, electronic purchases from 1 November to 25 December 2017 were extended to 30 days for the return of entertainment goods.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period starts on 25 December, i.e. before 25 January 2018.
A great shopping experience, a new era of shopping in the business world.
More than a decade ago, we were in the overall seller market, with limited options and limited demand.
But after 10 years of development, the market has long been transformed from the seller to the buyer market, and the consumer's taste has become worse, and they are no longer content with simple "show-to-go" shopping.
So how to get consumers to have a great shopping experience becomes the next competition for real estate developers.
And among the many factors that affect consumer shopping experiences, shopping centres in the business world are the most influential.
See how city builders focus on shopping experiences everywhere.
There are no identical leaves in the world, no identical shopping malls, and a famous shopping mall necessarily has its own characteristics.
For example, the world-famous Kanyon shopping mall in Turkey, whose unique wave-shaped architecture is inspired by Canyon, is named Kanyon, who walks in the 200-metre walk of Minister Kanyon as if he were inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to canyon-style designs, there is a large elliptical performance site in the center of the mall, which is unique in shape and often features.
The open platform was designed to allow tourists to walk on every floor and look down at the activities of the Gorge and have the effect of a change of scenery.
At home, the Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, known as China's first forestwalking consumer, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
Seven hundred square metres Green Square, 3,000 square metres roof water platform, consisting of nine single-body buildings, air-collage links between buildings, a whole sinking courtyard design, top-of-the-ground French groves as tops of buildings, roof water roofs, and forest-like feeling.
Walking into Forest Moore is like falling into a rabbit hole in Alice's Wonders, climbing trunks surrounding buildings, grasses, springs, and bringing people into a forest full of life and life.
Also in Chongqing, Long Lake built the Salvain Water Business Circle to plan 100 different businesses, planning to introduce more than 50 international top-selling flagships, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 national and international brands in the future, to become a conglomerates of the service industry, a well-focused business centre.
In addition, the Reginan Water Business Circle integrates ecology into buildings, with a combination of fashion shopping, living services, catering, recreation, education and sports, with a view to giving consumers a great shopping experience, while also leading them to enjoy the unique "waterfront culture" of Chongqing, combining shopping with water and recreation.
On the whole, it can be seen that some housing enterprises are now familiar with this new urban business trajectory, and industry sources suggest that this consumption model, which is centred on consumer experience, and how to combine shopping with experience, will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
The business world now is not just a repository of goods, but also a complex of artistic culture, creative themes and responsibility for urban settlements.
Therefore, while meeting the one-stop material needs of consumers to eat and play, maximizing the multilayered spiritual need for the transmission of culture and art, and fulfilling the need for habitable housing, must be a high point for the future development of the business community.
In Chongqing, the north bank of the nation is located north of the river, close to the bridge, close to the sound bridge, the world's commercial excellence, the international conglomerates, the first class of brands, and close to the international fashion.
There's a lot of movement here, and there's a lot of beauty in the world.
Toshihara has a better shopping environment, near the South Lawn Business Circle, exclusive access to the Western and even the country's leading four-storey traffic system, which enhances the comfort of shopping.
In addition, the greening of the gardens on the two foot streets of Leisure Works Road and Wanda Square, the upgrading of the landscape floors, the planting of approximately 300 logs, the renovation of 40,000 square metres of land and the enhancement of the image of the South Lawn business community;
Lake Dragon Lake One, near Chongqing's first low-density watercoat business circle, surrounded by nine parks, low density and openness of commercial neighbourhoods, makes people more willing to stay, stay, enjoy the pleasure of shopping rather than rushing on by people behind.
Today's commercial competition will only get stronger, killing a bloody path in a highly homogenous market, capturing the reputation of a shopping shrine in the hearts of future consumers and worthy of serious consideration by all real estate developers.
The strategy of differentiation alone is far from sufficient, and only those developers who really really put consumers in their minds, rush consumers, think consumers' minds, and give consumers an excellent and easy shopping experience can laugh in the market when the storm comes.
And, of course, I think it's the people of Chongqing who have such a good shopping experience and business circles that no one could have imagined today's glory 10 years ago.
Festival: Consumerist carnivals to mask real environmental prices
$16,82.2 billion, this is November 11, 2017, the 24 hours of the "Sky Cats 11 Global Carnival" when Skycat users pay for their consumption.
Specifically, three minutes after the two 11s, the cat's deal is over $10 billion, six minutes and five seconds, over $20 billion, and 100 billion in nine hours.
On that day, the total number of payments made by consumers worldwide through the payment of treasures amounted to 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over the previous year.
This consumption will bring 812 million logistics orders.
And whether it's a Skycat platform or a pay-as-you-go platform, it belongs to the Ali Group in Maun.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that on November 11, single youths, made out of self-scoffing, would have been compiled by electric dealers to become today's phenomenon-like "Girl 11" shopping carnival.
On November 11th, 2009, Ali Baba used the first marketing head of the "Lightstick Festival": no one's in love with you, so the "Single Dogs" come and buy it online.
Surprisingly, this day's trade in Treasure Stewardship was over $52 million, 10 times the amount of the day's trade.
From that point on, Double 11 became the shopping festivities built by Ali Baba, from the beginning of which domestic buyers made their own fun, to the current influx of global merchants, nine years later, the Twilight Cat had more than 3,200 times the amount of trading that year, making the Black Friday impossible.
There's also a lot of power vendors, including Kyoutung.
"Kingdong" has his own shopping festival 6.18, but it doesn't have the effect of "B" 11, which lasts from November 1st to November 11th, bringing the cumulative sales of "Kingdong" to 12.7 billion yuan.
And after Double 11, it's followed by a similar double 12 party, Christmas New Year's shopping slot.
After New Year's, there are Chinese consumers waiting for the pre-summer year purchase slots, Valentine's Day shopping slots, consumption, no vacations.
The environmental implications of instantaneous consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua's daily telecommunications, the average standard of 0.2 kg per box in industry is conservatively estimated to produce at least 300,000 tons of garbage this year during the Double 11 period.
Liu Hua, Director of Pollution Prevention and Control, Greenpeace East Asia Division, told China and China that this year's double 11 cat orders will produce 160,000 tons of packaged garbage.
The National Postal Service issued a report in 2016 indicating that in 2015 during the "Dual 11" period (11-16 November) there were approximately 780 million fast-loads using more than 3 billion woven bags, 9,922 million boxes and 16,985 million metres of duct tape, which can circle 425 laps around the Earth's equator.
And this year, the National Post Office expects that the double 11 is worth more than 1.5 billion.
The manager of a waste-burning centre in Beijing told Xinhua Society that more than 2,000 tons of garbage were coming into the yard every day after Xinhua, and that it exceeded the capacity of the burning station.
The delivery company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry is not insignificant.
A number of electric utility logistics companies, including Suning, introduced recycled and reused plastic delivery boxes that could be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags, etc., but were less acceptable to troubled consumers.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" on Twitter.

What kind of mobile payments do the Germans want?
JANG Dongfeng: The mobile payment battle in Germany is not looking forward to it.
We don't pay and pay but to move the battlefield to Europe. The rivals have not changed, the positions have not changed — the Chinese — and it's globalization?
Where there is a payment treasure, there must be a micro-payment.
Under an agreement with Wirecard, an electronic payment service provider in Germany, the payment was officially made in November this year in Germany and is gradually being laid out by businesses within Europe.
This time in Europe, the two of us from "Oldland" met.
All along, pay the treasure and pay the micro-mail to sing on the path to globalization.
With regard to China's approach to globalization of mobile payments, Irene's consultation on the China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Study 2017 concluded that there are two types of research: one is strategic investment, empirical export, equity and support for foreign home-grown mobile payers.
The second is the promotion of mobile payment services to foreign businesses through the consumer behaviour of Chinese tourists abroad, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of China ' s mobile payments by foreign natives.
It's true, the Chinese have the world.
China's rapid economic development, coupled with a large population base, is an attractive figure for Chinese tourists in Europe.
But it's also fated that the Chinese mobile payment battle in Germany this time is not looking forward to it.
Is it also globalization when we pay and pay the treasure to move the battlefield to Europe, where the rivals have not changed, where the positions seized — or the Chinese — have not changed?
What is more pioneering is the question of whether China ' s mobile payments can spread across Europe ' s interior?
Take Germany, for example.
"New Retail" enchanted.
Chen, Yang Kaihe: The Amazon announces military bookstores and grocery stores, regardless of timing or motivation, as he rushes into the world's 10 largest retailers.
In November 2015, Amazon opened the first real bookshop in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened a shop in New York and plans to have at least eight by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, Amazon announces that no-one's supermarket (Amazon Go) will run on a trial basis, that customers will not have to wait in line to the store, that they will not have to close their accounts, that they will go through the door and take away the goods they want, and that the purchase money will automatically be deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, it's an unexpected thing to suddenly move around the real store in recent years.
Because as early as 2007, in an "open letter to shareholders", CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that the Amazon would not open a real shop easily unless the following four conditions were met:
1. We must be sure that this new opportunity will yield returns on shareholders ' investments;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great importance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4. We must be convinced that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookshops and grocery stores are the most rocky categories of retail sales in both entities and the first to fall in the Amazon.
The Amazons announced their entry into the markets of both entities, regardless of timing or motivation, as they squeezed into the world's 10 largest retailers.
Was the Amazon practice contrary to the assurances contained in the shareholder's letter?
A similar voice was heard on the other side of the globe. On the morning of 13 October 2016, the President of the Board of Directors of Alibaba gave a keynote address at the 2016 Hangzhou Clouds Congress.
He said, "From next year, Ali Baba will no longer speak of "electronic commerce".
The era of pure power suppliers will soon come to an end, and there will be no e-commerce in the next decade or two, to be replaced by "New Retail".
The combination of online and logistics will result in new retail sales ... "
At one point, the word "new retail" was like being enchanted, with a lot of industry to say.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
If it's just a combination of fingers and lines, then it's not a new concept.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked 180 of the largest electricity suppliers and estimated their total sales at about $200 billion, of which the top 25 accounted for more than $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers (e.g. Macy's Department, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.) that only started operating on the line in the last five years.
And the Aribaba Group, with its $28.3 billion in Sunning Clouds, has seen it.
Globally, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to an all-channel retail system that covers real shops, electricians, mobile end and social media.
Is "New Retail" more a summary than a vision of the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole channel concept and "new retailing"?
Perhaps the point is not whether it's going to merge with it, but how it's going to merge.
Looking back at the past 20 years of retail trade, the rise of electricity suppliers, like the rise of early discount retailers, focused on prices and convenience.
With these two pains, the electrician moves highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the bottom of the line to the line.
With the development of online consumption habits and the growing experience of customers, the electrician has extended his tentacles to other types of goods and has begun to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO, "The use of Internet ideas and technologies to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing stock of about 30 trillion social retailers makes it possible to effectively meet the rising consumer demand of Chinese consumers, making the entire production and circulation of goods and services more efficient because of the Internet. "
So the electrician road is a superficially light asset that actually weighs on it.
"Light" means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc. is not as high as the traditional retail trade; "Light" means that the logistics, warehousing, etc. require huge inputs.
The changes in the logistics approach have ensured the efficiency of the electric power provider.
According to the Chinese Government ' s online sources, Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council hosted the State Council ' s Standing Meeting on April 28th, which considered the expansion of domestic consumption demand to be an important step towards steady growth and structural adjustment.

On January 18th, in Chongqing, Ali Baba held a high-level dialogue on the eradication of poverty among electricians, announcing the promotion of poverty eradication and rural revitalization through the exploration of a new "Internet+poverty" model.
This is a new "plus" for the fight against poverty, following the introduction of a rural strategy, the launch of a rural treasure-hunting project, the launch of the online farmers ' anti-poverty platform and the establishment of the Ali Baba poverty alleviation fund.
The fight against poverty is one of China's most important national strategies.
A complete exit from poverty has never been achieved in China in the last few thousand years.
" Alleviation of poverty by electric power suppliers is an innovation in the new round of pro-poor development and is an important enabler in achieving the goal of poverty reduction and poverty eradication. "
The Centre attaches great importance to, and notes, the role that the Internet can play in contributing to the fight against poverty, promoting precision in poverty alleviation, precision in poverty eradication and the release of agricultural products from the countryside through the Internet ... "
Thus, as early as 2014, Ali proposed a rural strategy, along with big data cloud computing and globalization, which is listed as three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Treasures Project to recruit "Village 2" in the village and lead farmers out of poverty through electricity dealers.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to create the Agriculture for Poverty Channel, which now brings together 13 provinces across the country, 120 poor counties at the national level.
Ali's platform has created 2,118 treasures in the village.
Of these, close to 400 are found in poor districts in provinces and 33 in poor districts in 13 countries.
In 2017, on the Alibaba China retail platform, the country sold 120 billion yuan worth of treasures.
Zhang Yong stated that, in the face of a national strategy to fight poverty, Ali had been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of the Ali economy to make a new way out of poverty.
Among them, the village is the main platform for Ali ' s electricity provider to lift out of poverty and has gone through a new Internet link to get out of poverty for direct sale.
In the planting chain, village raisins and ant gold garments jointly support farming tools and micro-credits.
In 2017, 795 ants served in 832 poor counties with easy payment, credit, etc.
Greenbirds deal with storage and logistics, Skycats are responsible for marketing, and Aryan's big data counterfeasible guides agricultural production and further improves the standards of supply, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of electricity suppliers out of poverty requires not only products, marketing channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali has achieved a combination of "poverty + mental support" and sustainable poverty eradication for farmers by offering electrical vendor courses at the University of Bao Po to teach them standardized, quality and scale farming methods.
These courses have covered approximately 92 per cent of the poor counties at the national level.
And the idea of "public service mentality, business means" can also guarantee Ali's "real poverty reduction" when it comes to poverty reduction.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Alibaba, Maun, said that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and wealth creation.
It's about giving people fish. It's about making them fish. It's about making a fish pond for farmers.
The power-driven industries that are pro-poor are fish ponds.
In terms of industrial poverty reduction, the model for poverty alleviation in the Los Angeles Apple industry, developed by Ali in collaboration with Shaan Si Locheon, has been replicated throughout the country as an example by the authorities.
Ali's power suppliers have also been recognized at the decision-making level for their efforts to combat poverty.
Electric companies, represented by Alibaba, have been sent to ensure that farmers increase their yields through online and offline channels.
Some of the village Xiaoji and ants in gold uniforms were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences in lifting the electricity vendor out of poverty.
At present, the United Nations World Food Programme ' s China Office has been working with Murai to reduce poverty in the electricity industry in Anhui and elsewhere.
The Third Congress of the New Economic think tank, co-organized by the Ali Institute and the China Vision think tank, was held on 16 January with the participation and presentation of Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of Electricity of the Ministry of Commerce.
She believes that our globalization really ignores the most important issues, namely, the nature and use of globalization and the stages of globalization.
Many people thus believe that globalization has stagnated and that many developed and developing countries have different attitudes to globalization in the new phase, as well as different patterns.
The second is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
The economic environment is constrained precisely by the changes in the economic base that have taken place as a result of globalization.
According to Zhang Lei, the global economic restructuring was largely over by the end of 2017, a new round of growth would enter after 2018, and the next round of growth would have to be raw.
The 7FRESH, the first birth market in Tokyo, has opened recently and plans to open more than 1,000 shops throughout the country over the next three to five years.
Add Ali's box of horses, immortal supers, Sunin's fish, the fish of the United States, and so on, the "new retail store" started to pile up and call each other on innovative models and even prices.
The race for fresh supermarkets has escalated into a phenomenonal topic in the new retailing area, where is the new retailing?
"In 2018, we will enter the country quickly, and in Beijing, Shanghai, by spring, Hangzhou will open a lot of shops. "
At the Second New Retail Summit, I revealed the new game of 2018.
"From 2018, the boxhorse was not just a raw electrician, but a consumer ' s immediate-service consumer.
Underneath the core mode is the flow, experience, the line is the real sale ... "
Different from the traditional malls, supermarkets, boxes of horses fresheners in the eyes of a lot of consumers, they're a fun red store, and there's even an agency that's got the concept of boxrooms.
Both online power platforms and offline retailers have advantages and disadvantages, while consumers appear through multiple channels, so both parties are trying the full channel model.
The industry believes that, in the larger context of rising consumption, there will be an increase in the number of shops in 2018 called "Cox Horses".
And the new year's new year with more innovation in the retail market can be heralded by the fact that the chariot continues to be explored from its first lifetime to more consumption.
"For example, the business model of online and underline combinations attracts the eyes of consumers, and the local supermarkets are called and well. "
"These relationships don't work until you've had a good experience with consumers, and I'm willing to pay for them. "
According to CEO Yuan Bin, in the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and the demand for purchases has changed.
Turns out the line is broken, the line is broken, the line is beaten, the line is counter-attacked, and now the consumer is holding hands because there is no longer a line-down distinction.
The competition for capital has made the new retail gunpowder, currently represented by the Live Supermarket, smell like it.
The analysis found that new retail competition in first-line cities is far from reaching the Red Sea and that there are large areas of second-line cities yet to be excavated, and markets remain open and open.
Different types of industries bring the development of new retailing into a diversified state of development for new retailing.
In conjunction with the Institute of Financial and Economic Strategy of the China Institute of Social Affairs and Economics, the Finance and Economics channel of China has combed out a dry product, which is the annual development report of the Chinese electricity merchants in the country.
What kind of report card has the Chinese electrician produced in the past year?
What are the trends in global electricity suppliers?
Let's do it for everyone.
Total sales are back on track at record speed again.
Since 2006, our online retail sales have been growing at an all-time high, and it's so cool to think that online purchases are fresh and can't be bought without a door.
However, the increase in online retail sales began to fall below 50 per cent starting in 2013, the first increase was below 40 per cent in 2015 and 26.2 per cent in 2016.
This year, however, the situation is different: online retail sales are accelerating again, rising to 34.2 per cent in January-September this year.
Much higher than 2015, with growth rates in 2016.
Maybe they're going around, and they find it more pleasant to buy.
Of this amount, net retail sales of goods in kind amount to nearly $5.08 trillion and service retail sales amount to almost $1.49 trillion.
The share of total retail sales of social goods amounted to 13.6 per cent, an increase of almost 3 percentage points over the same period.
Class, don't fall asleep, focus. It's a great deal of retail sales on the Internet.

Amy Erett used to want to investigate employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up company, but it didn't work.
The responses received are often vague, unhelpful and even worse, deceptive.
Even though she promised anonymity, some employees still don't trust the process.
Erett is running 75 man San Francisco e-commerce, Madison Reed, who says, "The response is lacking consistency and objectivity."
So she called for help.
A new group of start-ups in human resources has come to light, helping the company to understand how employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure staff participation, thus allowing companies to conduct rapid polls for specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for staff and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to report directly to the board of directors.
"Now, you can track your health by means of Strava and Fitbit, but where's the company Fitbit?" Jim Barnett, a co-founder and CEO of the Redwood Enterprise, says.
Erett said that in three years, she used Glint to get more insight into the thinking and feelings of her employees.
In addition to a quick survey and opinion poll by a particular team, Glint provides company heat maps, which units have the highest number of complaints, which managers have low approval scores, and it's obvious -- it allows her to get a deeper idea of why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they have to be skilled in the company’s workplace culture in order to avoid becoming the next vantage point. A blog post about the harassment environment was published by former employees, and the speakers were punished by the company, and then the valor fell into a scandal.
For a start-up company like Glint, this corporate desire for oversight is a money-rich business opportunity.
According to the Financial Technology Analysis website, the value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could exceed $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a start-up firm in Denver, Colorado, dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect bad behaviour, saw an increase in interest and activity during the loss of merit earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Euphoria, Microsoft and Tesla.
Yuzuki's recently signed into a client.
Like Glint, Convercent can get companies to send customized diagnostic surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and look at the hot maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous SMS hotlines for staff to report misconduct.
If the chairman is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convergent, said, "The Court of Opinion has usurped the powers of the regulator.
If a company is found to be ill-treated or unethical about its employees, it may face consumer resistance, loss of staff and the high consequences of being involved in litigation, as Quinlan states.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain that spans more than 500 places and has more than 25,000 employees, has been in use for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the work code and the work protocols and provide easy access to the company ' s headquarters.
Prior to that, if an employee wishes to report a problem, he or she must find the company ' s head office number or e-mail to file a formal complaint and hope that the headquarters will take it seriously.
It's often a scary and disturbing experience, as Ruby Tuesday's chief legal adviser, James Witrano, said, that he did not think there was a good way to track complaints from employees.
But now that the company uses Convercent, it can more quickly identify and resolve problems that were previously unknown to a remote office, a city or a state's management office - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
"I can get a full picture of my work experience closer, 360 degrees." Vitrano, who is in charge of Ruby Tuesday's risk management team, says.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation... "
According to Quinlan, companies began to pay more attention to ethics, values and staff professionalism in 2002 after Andorran accounting firm closed down for violating ethics in the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media went into their own world" that companies realized they couldn't stop their blasts from spreading the virus online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, hope is seen as a strategy," he said.
Glint and Convercent both offer their software as a service and charge companies recurrent fees for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who have already supported these two start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total of $60 million.
Given the interlinkage between companies, culture and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In a highly competitive market like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted, valued, that their time is spent on a company with an active mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voices are heard, and the work they do is good, they're more committed to making the company succeed." LinkedIn, Nina McCartney, Vice-President of Global Welfare and Staff Experience, says. LinkedIn uses both Convercent and Glint software.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio is performing well; companies are performing well when their employees are loyal and dedicated.
If the third-party analysis tool is committed to increasing the loyalty and professionalism of its staff, it's no wonder they're looking for financial support.
According to the workplace culture experts, it is important to have data on the professionalism of employees.
But these data are useless unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company is undergoing change.
If change is not moving fast enough, or if there is no progress at all, it may lead to disappointment and cause staff to leave the company.
"If you want to look for 400 proposals, then you need to be ready for 4000 conversations."
'Cause if you don't follow it all, the staff will think, 'Do you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why would I care?"
Eret said that Madison Reed now conducts a monthly staff survey and can take action on the day that Glint reports the problem.
After collecting feedback from staff on their frustrations due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by restructuring her intra-company team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees, and in the long run they want to be able to make a change in this industry, which is known for its high brain drain rate, and better retain its employees.
"If you don't work to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose your talent." Vitrano says.
"If you lose talent, you lose clients.
And when you lose your client, you lose your company. "

NCAAA cancelled twice a day of training and extended daytime training for Bears.
At 11 p.m., members of the UCLA football team wandered and chatted next to the team's new campus practice.
Some of the players have taken off their sweatshirts and exposed their bodies after hard training on the first day of the camp.
For a large part of the team, a few minutes is a break.
After three hours of practice, the summer participants will return to the dormitory to prepare for the final exam and then return to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the following morning.
"The next three days are a chord for these guys, and Coach Jim Mora of the Bears said on Monday's arrival on Tuesday.
NCAA cancelled two exercises a day (in order to ease the burden on the players), but actually extended their daytime training - at least by Friday.
That's why the first three training sessions at UCLA are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to adjust to the crowding schedule.
From the cancellation of training twice a day to more training once a day, the Bears started training almost a week before the last season, and Mora first trained at summer school in the six seasons of Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions on August 20, then start preparing for the official race of Texas farmers in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA regulation, although it would add another item to the team's busy schedule.
"In three or four days, we'll give them a huge amount of training, which is very challenging," Mora said.
"They just passed. They're grinding. They're great kids.
I think we'll have more time on Saturday. It's really great. "
As soon as the camp is over, UCLA will be out of practice. Given the proximity of the parking lot and the clear view of Luskin Center, this is not an easy task.
Starting this weekend, the Bears will be staying at the hotel, but Mora admits that once these rooms are empty during the season, there may be problems.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"This is a real concern. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room and record the training scene is not too far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security there, and we'll take security in parking lot 8.
We'll make the best use of the available resources.
I wouldn't worry too much about it.
We've made plans. "

Facebook will launch a fact-checking feature to counter false news.
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potential prank articles to third-party testing agencies and show the results under the original post. Facebook, the largest online social network in the world, is trying to crack the so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, Facebook stated that Facebook would begin to use an updated machine to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to a fact-checker, and might show the results of the fact-finding under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main outlets of the so-called false news, and many believe that Facebook has affected the 2016 presidential election.
This issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with voters experiencing a proliferation of false stories before the May presidential elections in France, Germany taking the lead in adopting a scheme of fines before the September elections, and a fine if social media networks fail to remove hate posters in a timely manner.
Facebook indicated in a separate statement in Germany on Thursday that a new functional test of fact-verification was being initiated in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing stories that have been challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more background to help them make informed decisions about reading and sharing."
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "relevant articles" functionality and make other changes to its press summaries to reduce false news.
Create a drawing novel: The story of the Castle of England
Recently, the tiny Castle of Scottney played a leading role in a compressed version of the music film and was once a refuge for Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the '70s and '80s.
But Scotney, who witnessed 700 years of turmoil in the comfort of the Baylor Gorge in Kent, is now a source of inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes, a man with a special interest in historical documents and with a moped head in Yorkshire.
"I can see the ancient handwriting of 300 years ago, and I find it so beautiful. " He says with all his eyes.
"What kind of personality is this to leave this letter in my hands?"
Throughout the Middle Ages and through the Eduard era, "A Castle of England" read books of families living in Scottney, each story being made by different artists from the future of England, such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book with a file as a raw material: he wrote "Death '2014', a book inspired by the English Library's literature, a work he's done with uncontrollable creative passion.
He said, "I couldn't contain my writing impulse from the moment I saw the thumbprint left on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent who worked for Jacobs in the 18th century."
"That's his fingerprints!
And the letter always smells like smoke, because then you need to light a fire to shine.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes us feel like they're here.
Oh, I love the archives!"
For those who were touched by the old paper, it seemed wonderful to have been supported by the National Trust and Arts Commission of England and lived in the castle for almost four months, and I can't believe it.
Rhodes spent days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, looking at archives, studying many of the estate's treasures and ancient games, such as hyena heads hanging on walls, bottles that spent centuries in the moat, and so on.
He walks on the land and ruins of the old castle, chats with the homeless, gardeners, sometimes with the art of drawing illustrations for his book.
And then at night, he'll "drink whiskey and write."
Scotney's hidden history is not very clear, because the British National Trust was only fully entered after the death of Elizabeth Hershey, the last heir in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff started processing the files, describing them as "the nobles of hundreds of years ago leaving: "Oh, put them in the attic."
The diary, a letter from the British Empire, depicts the map of national boundaries: "You'll think land disputes are boring." Roz says, "But two families will fight for a white birch tree.
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the work started with castles, which led to a broader study of British history, including The Labor, which was traced to a man who left the new castle to participate in the peasant uprising of 1381.
The story of the book called Knights of Kent and Sussex recorded a riot in the castle in 1380.
"The peasant uprising began in that area, and I think it was a good place to start the uprising.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of castles, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit pastor for seven years during the reform of the British religion.
Or "The Smuggler," the story is owned by an 18th century smuggler, Arthur Darrell, who was supposed to have his own funeral by filling his coffin with stones.
"The Darrells" is Rhodes' favorite Castle Scotney family: "These gentlemen seem to be scoundrels, always borrowing money to buy things they can't afford.
Generations of Darrell men solve their debt by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be handsome young men who know how to pursue women. "
With the end of his mission in the castle, Rhodes began to look for other strange writing experiences.
In the wilderness of Finland, he completed a drawing novel in two weeks, about "El?um?nm?ki," a early 20th century sanatorium, which was slowly abandoned.
But Scotney has a special position for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"It's like, "Oh, I have to go face-to-face in real life."
According to journalists, the Chinese intelligent car team is based in Joohai, and the executive vice president, Naking Communications, Tengo.
Large energy companies are all "rich and enemy", so who's the best in many energy companies around the world?
Yesterday, the well-known PFC Energy Company announced its top 50 rankings in 2011 for the US oil and gas producer Exxon Mobil, with $406.3 billion in market value, followed by China Oil and the Dutch Royal Shell.
In this list of PFCs, in 2007 and 2009, the first place in the other years was occupied by Exxon Mobil.
In 2011, out of the top 50 rankings, three companies from China and China entered, in addition to China 2nd, China ' s petrochemicals and China ' s marine oil 15th.
According to the PFC, however, although the current price of oil is much higher than it was four years ago, the CEO of the PFC Energy Company points out that there are many reasons for the low overall market value, including mainly the decline in natural gas prices in North America and the low activity of the global stock market.

U.S. modification of green card regulations
The media quoted President Donald Trump's statement that the United States would launch a new immigration plan to amend the green card regulations.
The scheme is intended to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 persons per year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications will be subject to stricter restrictions.
The new provisions were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
The American media quoted Trump as saying, "This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and achieve these benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will replace the current programme by reducing the chain migration.
This new application process facilitates English-speaking applicants with financial support and skills conducive to economic development ... "

In order to optimize the landscape and build a beautiful Nan Yue, the 636 volunteer team of the South Yue tobacco department recently launched a campaign to raise awareness of mountain rangers and care for their homes.
The campaign was supported not only by the entire staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also by retired seniors, whose families were involved in environmental practices, and by the three generations of youth working together to climb the mountain rangers, clean the garbage, and devote themselves to building the beautiful Nam Yee.
This volunteer campaign, which is aimed at preserving the South Pacific landscape, promoting the idea of volunteerism, "love for others, care for society, care for nature", has also enabled the next generation to take on the potion of volunteer virtues from childhood.
According to the information received, since its establishment in early April of this year, the 636 volunteer corps has grown up with 16 members, and has conducted a series of volunteer activities, including visits to handicapped retail customers, helping smoke farmers to care for tobacco leaves, and the Yaan earthquake love donation, which has become a volunteer force with a heart to deliver positive energy.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful.
Just when you didn't think it would be weirder in 2017, a new technology development report was released in the field of sex robots.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) released a report looking forward to the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to the Professor Emeritus of Robotic Technology and Artificial Intelligence of the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, Noel Shaggy, we need to start taking seriously the rise of sex robots.
Customers can choose the eye color, nipple shape and nail type of robot.
Shaggy said in his new report: "People laugh behind their backs, but corporations do have a lot of sex robots, and we'll see more."
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflated dolls to robots with silicone skins, warm touch and artificial intelligence to create human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also "write" their robots to meet their preferences, from eye colours, nipple shapes to fingernails or colours.
But what's more disturbing is that many robots with "personality" make the "reproducing wife" look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can come from definitions based on characteristics that users find attractive, such as shyness.
And the Roxxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Company, can predetermine character features, including the slightly shy "cold Fara" and the "prosperous Wild Wendy."
"Roxxy Gold Robots have personality that is as appropriate as possible to you," the True Company website is happy about this.
That's why she loves you and hates you.
She was just like a normal person in those days!
She can be lazy, she can talk, she can be "sexy"!"
The rise of sex robots has caused a lot of unease — not only to replace real human relationships — but also the grotesque female character and the most worrying hint of rape in the cold (read as resistance) of Fara.
True Company compares Roxxy to a man's truncheon on its website.
The website says, "If a woman has a vibrating stick, then why can't a man have Roxxy?"
But these sex robots aren't just lovers, and they're not just sex toys.
Their emergence and growing maturity point to the darker and deeper part of our culture: fleeing from perfect gender equality to sex with submission as an additional option.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the edge of consumer culture.
But something that infiltrates from the edges can show us the course of our time.
A lot of people aren't weird or aggressive until the free market gives them a chance to be like this.
It is no coincidence that these fine sex robots appear in an era where women ' s rights are threatened globally, and a White House president boasts of sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV show "The Tale of the Girl" is not about making the scene real, it's not about the body hanging, it's not about the eyes being dug out, it's about the imagination that's too real.
The Republic of Gillean is a leap, but it doesn't seem so far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create the body of the most authentic woman in technology (although in proportion to the sex stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have the human touch and imitate the real human movement.
But to put it straight, their personality doesn't represent a real woman.
They can't break up, they can't run away.
They have no recourse, no follow-up story, no independence, no possibility of breaking the whole idea of slavery.
In other words, they're fun slaves.
Or according to the general saying of 2017: "A girl."
"The Wall" tells the story of an ancient Chinese elite that fought in battles against monsters on the Great Wall, known as the Great Wall, to defend humanity.

Dundo said, "I won't do the same thing in the show. I'll keep it up to date."
The great work of Trump?
Let Mitt Romney be the epiphany of common sense.
Political divisions have led to polarization among American voters, and, from a microeconomic point of view, have undermined family harmony in America, which is already strange for the Trump era.
Before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States were rife with fears of how to respond to the election of Trump's relatives.
Usually, we're trying our best to crack our filter bubbles.
Even less so is Trump's power to bring his family together.
I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, had a long history of discord with the Republicans in our family, and he was visiting me in New York this week.
She reminds me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
By working with Trump at the White House, all the people she knew, even relatives of Republicans who had been fighting for decades, were suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It's certainly a good thing if we're all at the table, but I'm shocked that, from a broader perspective, this could be a major risk.
Although the left has always been inspired by Trump, the heated effect of his presidency drives us all to the right.
When we talk about normalization and Trump, we're talking about the possibility of fear that his odd behavior might one day stop.
However, there is a more worrying and long-term scenario in which Trump would like to "normalize" his relationship with the right-wing Republicans, who had opposed Mr. President's standards before, and now suddenly appear to be a symbol of reason.
I found myself recently missing a little bit about the madness of Mitt Romney: putting dogs on cars, 14% of the income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and it seems that these two moves are a little bit less criminal than Trump's.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate only needs to rationally qualify for incalculable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the carousel in New York Park, the biggest carousel in New York Central Park, and if you don't need coffee, the $3 ticket is the most valuable in the city.
The sound of the wooden horse is as loud as thunder, the central cylinder is designed for fibreglass, all the clowns and the animals turn their heads and look at their shoulders with horror and evil, while the jingle sounds strangely.
Too many mediocre cities are disappointing: the landscape overlooking high-rises has become old, the skyline has become too familiar with the incentives that no longer provide, and the reality of cities has not supported dreams.
35 years later, I haven't completely forgotten the day when I found out that this "Swiss House" was not really a Swiss cabin, but rather an old Swiss cabin at the theme bar, which I can't remember, but near a crossroads in northern London.
However, the carousel in Central Park is still a magical experience, and everyone has fun for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four 40-year-old girls.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I'd give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before I applied my credit card, I was asked to rate my business experience by one to five stars.
And in my coffee shop in the corner of the street, it's also possible to rate 15 percent of the tips, which is for shopping on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down the supposed neutral transaction, but also to put pressure on the waiter to add personal factors to the unwanted scenario.
The poor lady in the department store laughed, and I was tired, and the credit card experience gave her five stars.
Oscar Pistolis moved from prison to hospital for chest pain.
It's the second time Pistolis left prison and moved to hospital.
Last year he was taken to the hospital to treat a wrist cut, which the prison officials claimed was the result of his fall in the cell.
Pistolis was convicted of murder after the prosecutor appealed the original verdict of manslaughter.
In the early hours of Valentine ' s Day in 2013, he shot Stimkamp several times at his home in Pretoria through the toilet door until he died.
Pistolis claims to mistook her for a break-in in the middle of the night.
The prosecutor has announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year prison sentence against Pistolis, which they consider to be too generous.
The National Public Prosecutor ' s Office has indicated that an appeal will be lodged with the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal will be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistolis will face an increase of 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

On May 18th, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Advanced Fund Management Scheme for the Restructuring of Industrial Enterprises", which will provide special incentives for the removal of coal and excess capacity in the steel industry, amounting to $100 billion.
Many local governments, such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang, have recently proposed reforms to address excess capacity.
Among them, several provinces have even offered to actively seek the financial support of the Central Treasury for the productive capacity of their provinces.
In support of this, only eight provinces have declared coal-depletion targets that stand at 90 per cent of the national coal reduction plan.
In an interview with a journalist, Xiamen University Director of the China Energy Policy Institute, Lim Borging, argued that the steel and coal industry's "depletion capacity" on the basis of 100 billion yuan from the central sector was far from sufficient, and that more funding needed to be addressed by local governments and businesses.
In the recently published regulations for the implementation of coal production capacity in Shanxi Province, it is proposed that the Shanxi Coal Group be reorganized into a State-owned capital investment company, that the assets and operations of the enterprise be restructured and that a new business model be built.
The real funding gap could have been three times higher than before the subsidy, and the Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, Yoon Wimmin, indicated that the preliminary statistics for the "de-capitulation" of the employee coal system were 1.3 million, and the steel system 500,000.

Do the meat, dairy products and chocolates help to alleviate inflammational intestinal disease (IBD)?
The meat and chocolate may sound like your digestive nightmare.
But a new study shows the opposite: diets rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of inflammated intestinal diseases ...
The incurable disease has had life effects on about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British, causing stomach cramps and abdominal swelling, regular or haemorrhage, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at Washington University usually advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products in order to mitigate symptoms, but researchers find that key amino-cyanated acids in proteins contribute to the growth of immune cells that increase the resilience of the intestinal tract.
Dr. Marco Colonna, Chief Researcher, explained that immune cells patrol the intestinal tract to ensure that harmful organisms hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
To maintain a balance between the cells that cause inflammation and those that promote tolerance, and to protect the body from all kinds of sensitive and fragile tissues.
Inflammation can occur when the balance is too biased towards inflammation.
An immunity-promoting cell was found in rats carrying specific bacteria.
The bacteria need cyanide (a component of the protein) to form a cell's appearance.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between a bacterial population, a normal part of the intestinal microbial community, and the development of cells that promote resilience.
The more cyanide the mice consume in their diet, the more immune cells they have.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, i.e. a combination of Lactex and a diet rich in chlamydia, a more resilient and less inflammated intestinal environment could be created.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganewas, a postdoctor researcher, studied an immune cell that could increase resilience when she found out that a group of rats had such cells, but not when the other group of the same strains were raised separately.
She suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microorganisms in mice (the bacteria that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract, viruses and fungi).
DNA sequenced cholesterol in mice, and six bacterial species were found in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
The mice are rearing in a sterile environment, so they lack intestinal microorganisms and cannot produce this immune cell, and the presence of Lactus is producing immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivate Lactium in liquids and then transfer small amounts of bacteria-free liquids to immunosuppressive cells separated from young rats.
The immune cells develop into resilient cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be demonstrated that the active ingredient is a by-product of glutenine amino acid, known as leachate-3.
When researchers doubled the number of chromosomes in mice' feed, the number of these cells increased by about 50%, but when the level of chromosomes was halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people, like rats, have the same resilient cells, and most of us have Lactus in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether humans can induce cell development from Lactus by-products in their bodies, as in experimental mice, but genetic defects associated with chromino acid have been found among inflammated intestinal patients.
She said, "The growth of these cells is probably what we want because they control inflammation on the inside of the intestinal tract.
It may be inaccurate to say that the presence of high levels of cyanide in Lactium may lead to an increase in the number of species.
José Murinio thinks we signed the Genius Nemania Matic.
On Wednesday night, after Nemania Mathiech first appeared in the Sampsolia contest, Murinio decided that Mansion had signed a genius midfield player.
Martić came from Chelsea, with a contract of £40 million and won 2-1 in Dublin on Tuesday in the final pre-season match before the European Super Bowl in Royal Madrid, winning the favor of Paul Bogba and Andreas Perera.
However, in the pre-Brunesti Asian Tour, the Mattics were severely under-represented, only 45 minutes had been completed, and Muriño acknowledged the need for improvement before the British super season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and genius in thinking -- he thinks about football, and Muriel says.
"We'll help him prepare as soon as possible."
Murinio started his head starter at the beginning of the season, and like Martinch, the newly-contracted players Victor Linderlov and Romelu Lukacu started playing at the Injeju Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Murielio still wanted to bring in three more signed players, but he insisted that the club "worked well", that he had four top-chosen guys in his heart, and that the club had introduced three of them.
"The club brought in three of the contracted players, and I'm very grateful." He added.
"I'd be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they've done a great deal for me. "
Will China be behind if it doesn't build a frigate?
With the recent announcement by the world's major naval powers of plans for the construction of new frigates, as if one night the frigates had become the focus of the attention of the naval forces of the great Powers, first of all, the decision by Japan to purchase two new frigates in its 2018 defence budget, which led to a substantial breakthrough in the Japanese frigate DEX plan, and then the recent announcement by the United States of the latest plan for the United States frigate FFG, where is China's new frigate?
With the discharge of one of the latest 054A frigates at the end of 2017, marking the construction of up to 29 frigates in 054A, approaching the sum of the 053H series, the construction of 054A has been under way for 12 years since the first 054A in 2006, and the construction of such a large number of high-performance common frigates worldwide, except for China, where only the United States built the "Perry"-class frigates in the last century and 1980s.
And the simple reason why so many 054As are built is that they're good, good for use, and they're a supplement to years of Navy arrears.
The frigate 054A, which has been favoured by the Chinese Navy for many years with a high value of value and good combat power, with about 4,000 tons of drainage, a 76-mm main gun, 32 units of sea red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missile co-launched hair-trigger systems, 8 eagles hitting 83 and a direct-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and was designed earlier, its combat power is not too poor, even today, and it can reach the upper-to-medium level among the world ' s frigates.
But, after all, this is a ship designed at the beginning of the twenty-first century with a weapons configuration on one side, with a wide gap in power systems and electronic radar equipment compared to the current world ' s mainstream frigates, such as the European frigates, which are already equipped with full power propulsion, small multifunctional array radars, large-sized helicopter decks, and the time to develop a new type.
So how China's new frigate should develop is directly related to its future orientation and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will surely become the blue-water navy, and the future will be the ocean, with areas where the interests of China are at stake, rapid deployment, the presence of force and, if necessary, the strength of combat power to ensure that China ' s vital interests in the region are not compromised.
And look at the location of the new frigate in the future Chinese navy sequence. The future Chinese navy should be similar to the United States Navy. In addition to the required offshore defense vessels, other major ships will form carrier combat groups or amphibious attack ships as required.
And the role of the new frigate should serve as an anti-submarine backbone and a neutral position in the mid-to-central area in the future carrier battles, and as a frigate class in the amphibious attack fleet, which requires that the new frigate must have a strong anti-subsperial capability and a good mid-range capability.
Based on the above positioning, a bold vision of the future of the frigate is possible.
First, there would be a significant increase in discharges compared to the current 054A frigates, with an estimated discharge volume of 5,000-6,000 tons from the new frigates; the power system would use an integrated power propulsion system consisting of an improved QC280 gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed of about 30 knots and a significant increase in the continued capacity; as far as the weapons configuration of the 76 mm main gun and the 1130 near-barrell should be maintained, but as far as the electronic radar system is concerned, a red flag 10 launch system would be added, with a 32-48 unit of an improved red flag 16 and a fish-8 co-scavenger ding system behind it, and a large 8-to-16 unit should be installed behind the ship's hull for launching Eagle 18 and new cruise missiles; the hangar and hangar platforms would also be increased, reaching two 10-ton helicopters would be parked and stored; and as far as the electronic radar system was concerned, it would be equipped with a small four-face fixed-side control system based on 346-A, which could be fitted with a multifunctional rotation control radar similar to the European frigate.
This would bring the new frigates together to the world's best standards, even if it were more than the FFG of the United States.
Of course, the above concept is merely an assumption of the new frigate of national production, and we can only find out when the new frigate is in the water, so let's look forward to it.

In recent years, our city has encouraged the active participation of enterprises in the development of national, industry and regional group standards, awarded 300,000 yuan to enterprises that are either primarily or involved in the development of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and 500,000 yuan to enterprises that manufacture brand certification through Zhejiang, the highest level of the award in the province, which has stimulated business participation in the subject matter.
Earlier, the head of the Wang Li Group Production Workshop, along with his staff, Gao Jian, was packing a security door block against theft as a sample for participation in the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard against the standard standards, to be sent to the Quality Monitoring Centre in Shao Xin.

What's worse is that China's household debt rate is closer to the United States than it's going to be able to afford a home?
In recent times, everyone has been discussing recent changes in real estate policy, whether real estate policy will be untying again. Will the diversification of land policy providers lead to a decline in housing prices?
But at a time when we were worried about real estate prices, macroeconomic regulation, and the future of the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again. The last time we devoted our comments to the regulation of real estate, the People's Daily writes about a more serious topic than the affordability of housing, which is whether you can afford the debt even if you can afford it.
Today, let's talk about a bigger problem than buying a house: repayment.
First, the growing housing debt crisis in China
According to data from the People's Daily Overseas edition, which published a review article on 17 January, "Ewards and Loans: Fighting Young People's Joys and Concerns", in November 2017, the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Centre published the "Three Quarterly Report on China's Deleveraging Process", which states that the population sector's leverage ratio continued to rise, from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter, up 1.3 percentage points, up 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The share of debt of the resident sector in the overall real economy has increased, and the leverage rate has risen faster.
Studies show that the liabilities of Chinese households in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, which account for about two thirds of the liabilities of residents, about twice as much as the operating loans.
Among them, medium- and long-term loans, dominated by housing loans, account for about 80 per cent of consumer loans, but in terms of growth, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition to this, China ' s household debt ratio merely accounts for the total amount of credit that the family sector has received from financial institutions, while Chinese households have a lot of private loans, including loans to relatives and friends, and large-scale hidden debts.
In view of the data, it is surprising to note that, according to the statistics of the Suning Institute of Finance, China ' s leverage rate was only 3 per cent in 1996 and 18 per cent in 2008, but since 2008 it has begun to grow rapidly, doubling in just six years, reaching 36.4 per cent. By the third quarter of 2017, the population ' s leverage rate had reached 48.6 per cent.
Let's compare the data again. In May last year, HSBC released a survey report across nine countries, which interviewed close to 10,000 people.
The report was visited by the Millennium generation of young people from nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report states that China ' s housing ownership rate for young people after 80, 90 years is as high as 70 per cent, with the second largest country in Mexico (46 per cent) and double the United States target of 35 per cent.
The data tell us one of the most likely problems is that China's biggest potential "hose rhinoceros" at this stage will probably not be able to pay off their debt compared to being unable to afford a house.
Secondly, why is the housing crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analysed, although we have always said that China has higher housing prices, China has a rather high home ownership rate compared to other countries in the world.
We look at the world ' s real estate markets, which, due to their late start, have not experienced a major real estate crisis, except for what we said earlier about Hainan, but just 10 years ago, the origins of the 2008 financial tsunami in the world were the real estate crisis in the United States.
The real estate crisis in the United States was attributed to two houses: the house, the house, and the house.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses to low-income people in the United States to expand their sales at a very low down payment, and when the United States economy was better, the real estate market was booming, but the good news was slow, causing the income of home buyers to fall, so that large household consumption expenditures began to fall as the United States economy stagnated.
However, the current situation in the United States was one of financial assets and real estate assets that formed part of United States household assets, almost all of which were real estate in the low-income group of the United States, while most of the assets in the top 20 per cent of the high-income group were financial assets, and the higher the debt rate for real estate in the United States, the poorer it was.
A serious fact is that these people buy houses at a better time of economy, so the money to pay mortgages is also calculated in terms of their better income, and that when income falls, the pressure on mortgages not only does not decrease, but even increases because some subprime schemes have become floating, so that the real estate problems of these American families have gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
This has led to a downward spiral in housing prices in the region, which has led to a vicious circle in which more and more buyers find their houses worth even less than their own loans, and more people stop paying their mortgages and create more bad debts after the prices have fallen to a certain extent.
As a result, a huge vicious circle emerged:
"The recession — the decline in income — some people can't afford to pay their mortgages — banks sell their unindebted houses at low prices — house prices fall — more people stop paying their mortgages — banks sell them — house prices fall again..."
And the problem is more than that, because the price of the house continues to fall, you don't have a debt after you stop paying the bank, and if you don't get the money you owe to the bank when you auction the house, then you have to pay the money back. If you pay the first $600,000, loan $2.4 million for a house worth $3 million, you don't pay the bank back when the house falls to $2 million, and after you auction the house, you lose the first $600,000 and you pay the bank $400,000.
So, in this vicious circle, the US economy collapsed, eventually triggering the US financial crisis of 2008.
Thus, the high level of domestic debt in China at this stage, at 46.8 per cent, is a matter of great vigilance. The data are still below the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly emphasized deleveraging since last year. This is a very priori judgement that family debt ratios, if allowed to continue rising, will entail a huge risk, so that financial risks will be kept in check.
Then the house was used for living, not for scavenging, and the State speeded up the creation of multi-substance supply, multi-channel security, rental and merger measures to further mitigate the potential risks.
For our own families, it is important to move away from real estate speculation, to buy houses in a way that prevents their families from falling into a huge burden, and only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt levels is a healthy path to family wealth development.

White House props cost thousands of dollars.
According to the military records published in Time magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing at a cost of $24,000.
In green and white, the Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine 1 when the president was on board) was an important exhibit of the White House on July 17th, highlighting the construction project in the United States.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Burns and senior White House officials have visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibit consisted of a Connecticut-made helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the first fleet of marine helicopters (HMX-1) responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the White House military office requested the helicopter to appear on the daily order (FRAGO) only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the south lawn for this "special" event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1, in an e-mail to the superior Deputy Commander of the Marine Corps, said, "I just want to make sure that you know, because this event is highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive on the south lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 at 3 p.m. and leave after clearing the lawn at 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.
The information also indicates that, in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, a second crew would be required to return due to the time limit for duty.
The original crew was on standby by the helicopter during the operation, while the security forces were on standby nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
The record from Times doesn't clearly indicate whether a second crew is ultimately needed.
The Hutch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
According to the record, HMX-1 has asked if the event was in violation of the Act.
The commander wrote, "The question we asked is whether this is a violation of the Hutch Act and was told that there was no violation."
"It sounds like you're locked up." Deputy Commander replied.
The White House defined this "American manufacturing" activity as an official activity and therefore not subject to the Hutch Act.
But even official activities are political.
At the event, the President pursued the issue of the then Senate: medical reform, and brazenly praised the regulation of government regulations.
The use of Marine 1 or Air Force 1 for political propaganda purposes is no longer new.
Successive presidents have been asked to travel with these planes.
But it's not common for them to be requisitioned just for the purpose of taking pictures.
In February, Trump received attention when the president's jet slipped into Melbourne, Florida, and ended up in the background of his first election rally, while his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the use of the president's jet by the former president.
The White House deputy news spokesman Lindsay Walters said, "The White House was excited about this "American Manufacturing" exhibition, which showcased products from all 50 states that were made by American workers using American materials."
HMX-1 flight crews regularly conduct flight training near Washington and on the South Lawn to practice the exact placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
HMX-1 had 58 landings at the White House during Trump's G-20 Summit in Germany in early July.
According to one official, this U.S. manufacturing flight was included in this month ' s crew training requirements.
The helicopter unit flew an extra 11 hours of "non-presidential support mission."
The White House claims that the taxpayers did not pay for any of the other props at the event.
Sikorsky spokeswoman said the company was not involved in arranging a South Lawn helicopter show.
HMX-1 does not maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence hourly charges recorded for the 2017 fiscal year, the reimbursement for VH-3D is US$ 24,380 per flight hour.
Force records recorded 30 minutes of each flight from a base at Quantico Marine Airport, Virginia.
The White House says the cost of operating the helicopter is much lower than the cost.
Walters claims that "the cost of the taxpayer's assessment based on reimbursable fees is misleading.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many others, including the cost of sinking in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but do include oil, maintenance and contractual costs.
At that time, a former White House news spokesman, Sean Speicher, defended the operation using the helicopter.
"The idea is to show what the U.S. made this week,
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, and they both have contributed to our national security, and I guess there are hundreds of people who work on it without thousands.
And I think, like most Americans, we're proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of countless American efforts.
So it's certainly not out of the question. "
We don't know if Trump interacted with the helicopter during the tour of the South Lawn, but he did get in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to a representative of Sikorsky and joked about his own company's aircraft with the media.
He said, "I know the Sikorsky plane. I have three."

13 developers competed for the price of a block of land in the Tianhai Red Chemical Plant or would break 10,000 yuan/m2
Sheng City evening news reporter Zhao Yanhua reported that no fewer than 13 developers will be fighting this afternoon to rob the Red Chemical Plant Land, which today's concession will be the Red Red Chemical Plant Land on the Yellow River Avenue in the Tianhai region, which is a type II residential area (R2), with a surface area of 17304 square metres (15178 square metres of buildingable land) and a building area of 45534 square metres.
The plots have a small and medium-size set of requirements, and the proportion of housing areas below 90 square metres in the total area of residential development is not less than 60 per cent.
Based on the maximum size of a small and medium household, the plot will provide at least 303 small and medium-sized dwellings.
The area is known to be on the east side of the Yellow Pilgrim, across the road to the Tianye Building Design Institute, which is well equipped for the first residential area of the Tianhai River that has been erected this year.

According to the Market Star, between 2005 and 2011, my provincial GDP rose from the middle side of the list to the bottom.
But my provincial economy continues to suffer from low investment efficiency and a lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy. To this end, the latest edition of the "Blue Economics Page" of the provincial economic information centre recommends improving the quality and effectiveness of economic growth.
A comparison with the national and central regions is based on a number of representative indicators of our provincial economy in 2005 and 2011.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, the high energy-consuming industries such as raw materials, which account for a significant share of industrial energy in my province, were more affected by market fluctuations and had a "double pressure" on excess capacity, while the dominant industries, such as domestic electricity and automobiles, were under-innovated, leading to low profits.
And the fact that large investments do not bring corresponding economic benefits is an important reason for the poor quality and efficiency of economic growth in our provinces.
In this regard, the experts recommend that effective measures be taken to encourage innovation in enterprises and that the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes be "transferd" to enterprises in a timely manner.
With regard to the low efficiency of the industrial economy, experts said that it was also important to actively promote industrial merger restructuring, optimize industrial layout and extend the industrial chain.

According to the British General Union Scotland, the company has remained silent about the future of the Tollcross factory investment.
The factory has more than 500 employees who produce oatmeal biscuits, rich tea biscuits, etc.
The owner of McVitat's Pradis says that over the last few years, the company has invested more than £5 million in the factory.
He added that if there was a change in the operation of the plant, the employees and union representatives would "take the lead."
In a letter to the director of the company, the Scottish branch of the British General Union called on McVitat to "resolve the problem of money not being transferred to the modernization of the production line."
The Senior Founder of the British General Union, Drew Duffy, said, "We can't get a clear picture of the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcross from the general manager of the plant, which is a source of deep concern to our members.
Generations and generations of families work here, and the high concentration of labour in the local community and Grand Glasgow is an important pillar of high unemployment and social deprivation of decent employment in the region.
Thus, from the perspective of employment, pay and economic prosperity, the eastern Glasgow region urgently needs an expanding production network of McVitats against the backdrop of the rising cost of living and the prolonged decline in manufacturing in the United Kingdom ... "
The spokesperson for Pradis said that "the director of Tollcross just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of the British Confederation of Trade Unions, and that the company would respond immediately, as we value continuous contact with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the General Union of England in Tollcross to discuss a number of issues in public.
We had discussions with our employees, and then, like all other companies operating in an environment of intense competition and economic uncertainty, we reviewed the business continuity model that we applied to enterprises and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in production lines and business improvements.
We are fully aware of the historical status of Tollcross as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, employees and union representatives will be the first to know ... "

Three years ago in St. Germain, Paris, did you warn Barcelona to sign Nemal?

After an offer of £189 million to allow it to exercise its immunity clause, St. Germain of Paris would not give up his entry into Nemal, but had they warned Barcelona three years ago of launching an attack on the world record raider?
