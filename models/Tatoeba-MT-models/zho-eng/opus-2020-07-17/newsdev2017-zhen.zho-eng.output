New issues in water engineering in California
Following the disclosure that the administration led by Governor Jerry Brown in a major water management area in California would provide government funds to complete planning for two giant water tunnels, a number of commentators and a State Councillor indicated that they would like to know who would bear the cost of the $16 billion proposed water project supported by the Governor.
According to commentators, the government funds mentioned in the L.A. MWD Thursday may be contrary to the State ' s long-standing commitment to the realization of Brown ' s vision to dig two 35-mile long tunnels to facilitate the flow of water from the Sacramento River south and to provide primarily to the vision of the central and southern Californian region, where the local water pipelines (not California itself) will bear the costs.
The $248 million initial cost expenditure of these two tunnels has been the subject of an ongoing federal audit without the approval of the regulatory authority.
Some state councillors also ordered an in-state audit of tunnel expenses on Wednesday.
State spokesman Nancy Vogel said on Thursday that although the account belonged to the Los Angeles City Watershed, it would not use any of the state ' s ordinary funds to complete the work at the current planning stage of the tunnels.
However, opponents of the tunnel project and a group of taxpayers criticized on Thursday, and Susan Egman, a State Legislature member of the State Legislature behind this week ' s audit order, asked the state government to clarify the situation on Thursday.
David Wolfe, the lawmaker of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Association, said, "It's a scam."
I think for yesterday's audit (request): there are far more questions than answers.
The tunnel project is supported by Brown and a number of politically influential water management areas and water users in central and southern California.
Supporters say that these two tunnels will benefit the environment and help California to ensure a safer water supply.
The opponents, for their part, expressed concern that the state would divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the Bay of San Francisco through these two tunnels, thereby causing damage to northern California and threatening the survival of the species there.
In view of the uncertainty as to whether this massive expenditure would actually bring them enough water to reduce the price of water, the water management areas of large cities expected to extract water from tunnels and other water management areas have not made commitments to bear the costs.
These water management areas have also declared this year that they will not bear the cost of completing the current initial work until the project is approved by the regulatory authority.
On Thursday, a monthly report issued by the Los Angeles Water Management Area on the tunnel project stated: "The state has indicated that any additional funding required to complete the planning phase will be provided from state or federal sources ... "
The Los Angeles Water Department spokesman, Bob Muir, said that after all the local water management areas had invested in the project (including $63 million from his own water management area), "foreseeably" the state would use government funds to help complete the planning phase.
He asked State spokesman Vogel further questions.
Vogel indicated that the State intended to draw funds from user fees for the existing water network (i.e. state water works) that had been in use for half a century to complete the planning of the tunnel project.
However, opponents of the tunnel project turned to a bill passed by the State Councillors in 2009, which they said prohibited the State from investing in the tunnels unless the water services that benefited from them committed themselves to bearing the cost of the tunnels.
The long-standing opponent of the proposed tunnel, Patricia Schrefler, environmental consultant, said, "The project contractor had promised to bear the cost of the project, but they avoided that obligation through a financial trick."
So the question is where the money is going to go.
Corporate groups filed claims with China on cyber security laws
A coalition of international enterprise groups called on China to change the proposed rules on cybersecurity and warned that they would harm trade and isolate the country ...
Forty-six groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America co-signed a letter addressed to Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, reflecting the degree of global concern that information security rules may restrict or prevent the entry of information security products into the Chinese market.
The signatories include the United States Chamber of Commerce, the European Forum of Services and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
China ' s proposed rules on cybersecurity will require suppliers to demonstrate to the relevant Chinese authorities how safe products work and to store information on Chinese citizens in China ...
The latest letter issued on Wednesday states that this may make data more vulnerable to theft and may reduce access to Chinese clients ...
Tianjin chemical explosion: anniversary of the first anniversary of the deadly catastrophe
Zhang Monfan said the public should know what happened during the Tianjin bombing.
China’s leaders may wish to commemorate the first anniversary of the huge explosion that killed 173 people in a silent manner, but not everyone thinks so.
Please see John Soodworth's report from Tianjin.
If this magnitude of disaster happens anywhere else in the world, its anniversary will almost always be reflected in profound national reflections.
It's not like that in China.
While the city of Zin was holding a memorial ceremony for the dead firemen, the commemorations elsewhere were being kept low.
Communist-controlled media were told what to say and what to say, and some survivors and relatives of the deceased were warned not to speak out.
However, 23-year-old Zhang Dreamfan won't remain silent.
"On this anniversary, the public should have a way to know what happened," he told me.
I don't want to be silent.
On August 12, last year, Mr. Zhang was a radio operator of the army fire brigade, only a kilometre away from the blast centre at the fire station.
He said, "The call came at 10:53 p.m., and then we started sending my teammates."
It'll take them 10 minutes to get there.
Firefighters from other parts of the city are arriving to deal with a fire in a chemical warehouse.
None of them may have realized that the on-site violations contained a large quantity of volatile and toxic substances far exceeding the permitted amount and were not properly managed.
At that time, a batch of nitrofibrous fibres (a chemical used for nail polish) was allowed to be dryed and then lit at high temperatures in the summer, triggering a fire.
The fire then spread to areas where there was a large stockpile of ammonium nitrate fertilizer (800 tons).
The ensuing explosion destroyed the fire station's windows and caused the roof to collapse, while Monfan was standing by the radio waiting for reports from the fire scene.
And the reports never come back.
"When I saw the mushroom clouds, I fell into despair," he said to me.
I know what it means to my friends.
That night, his fire station sent 26 firefighters to the fire scene, eight of whom never returned.
Many of the firefighters who survived suffered severe burns and other injuries.
In two big explosions, the largest explosion was observed as an earthquake, and the blast wave was still felt many kilometres away.
The total damage caused by the disaster exceeds $1 billion, including more than 300 damaged buildings.
The total number of victims was 173, of whom 104 were firefighters.
The remains of eight of the victims were never found.
Official government findings attributed responsibility to corruption, political relations and collusion of officials, which led to a high level of discipline and disregard for the security system.
The warehouse shouldn't have been built so close to a residential building.
More than 100 officials and business executives are facing some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, while the Government can point to the progress made, such as the rehabilitation of thousands of homes and compensation for the population, there are persistent and sensitive problems.
The disaster revealed a systemic rift in which rapid economic growth was a priority and the lack of independent oversight was an indisputable fact.
The courage and sense of responsibility that night were unquestionable, but the side of the firefighter's image as a hero was another sad picture.
It's a picture of the firemen as victims who, without proper knowledge, were sent to an avoidable, man-made disaster.
Zhang Monfan has now left the fire department but will attend the Tianjin memorial service.
He will deliver a word in his heart for his lost comrades.
What I'd like to tell them most is that I went to see your parents, and they were fine.
Leave your parents to me.
I'm your family now.
I'll do my best for you.
The cold spring may affect the rooster hunting season in Scotland.
With the cold climate reducing the number of roosters this year, the rooster hunting season in Scotland will be delayed.
Because many of the early chicks didn't survive this cold spring, some of the estates have delayed hunting.
In an opening address for the rooster hunting season, the Scottish Huntskeepers Association stated that rooster hunting could maintain more jobs than the Edinburgh holidays.
But the animal protection charity Onekind calls for an end to the brutal killing of these birds.
The director of the organization, Harry Hayden, said, "Maintening rich birds for hunting in the hunting grounds requires a lot of work and always involves highly controversial practices. "
It is no wonder that the public is gradually taking a negative view of this so-called sports approach and calling on the government to regard it as a cruel and unnecessary way of entertaining some very small Scottishs.
But the landowners insisted that they were committed to protection and that pine hunting was vital to the rural economy.
Alex Hogg, President of the Scottish Huntskeepers Association, said that the industry maintained 8,800 full-time jobs per year in remote areas and became an employment-intensive zone for some uncertain periods.
He said, "Scotland has no inherent "hunting" culture compared to many other European countries, and many people do not understand the economic impact of the hunting season on the country. "
Mr. Hogg said that the number of full-time jobs dependent on hunting exceeded the total number of jobs created by the Edinburgh International Festival of Arts, the marginal festival of art, the disaggregated performances and the New Year ' s Eve event.
He added: "There are real concerns about employment in the rural areas of Scotland, especially in the oil and gas field, so the hunters and their families want to see the industry grow."
We want to work with the Scottish government to ensure that hardworking people can continue to rely on these jobs in the future.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that eight gold eagles are being hunted illegally in the vicinity of the pine chicken hunt.
Many gamekeepers admit that pine hunting is not generally popular, but the Scottish Huntskeepers Association says that the industry has made "significant progress in best practice".
The opening day of the rooster hunting season is traditionally known as the "Glorious Twelve."
However, there is still controversy about this recreational activity, and the management of the pine chicken hunting ground has been branded by some wildlife conservation organizations as persecuting the Raptor.
On Thursday, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds indicated that in less than five years, eight labeled gold eagles had disappeared in the Monalia Mountains, south-east of Inverness.
The wildlife charity believed that the eagles had been hunted illegally in the vicinity of the pine ground, while their satellite tracking tags had been destroyed.
The Scottish Minister of Environment, Rosana Cunningham, said that the reports were "very disturbing and disappointing."
Ms. Cunningham has instructed the relevant officials to analyse the signs of some 90 surviving and missing labelled eagles to determine whether there is a pattern of suspicious activity ...
The Scottish Hunting Fields Group accused the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds of trying to create anti-hunting sentiments before the season for pine chickens, and stated that there was no conclusive evidence that these birds actually died in the Monalia area.
The 2016 Rio Olympics: Bronnie Page picked a silver medal for Britain.
Peachy of England won the silver medal in the trampoline project.
Bronnie Pecchi Rio was the first English sportswoman to win an Olympic trampoline medal.
Twenty-five-year-old Paige scored 0.425 points less than the gold medal winner, and the Canadian player Rosanna McLennan won 56.465 points for the Olympics.
China, world champion Lee Dan picked a bronze medal, while another English player, Catherine Driscoll, won his sixth place.
I can't believe I won an Olympic medal.
"I'm really happy." Paige was very excited to say.
I didn't think I'd get a medal, but I did my best, so I'm happy that all the training and hard work paid off.
I'm glad to be in the finals with Catherine, and it's history for one player to move to the finals, and we have two.
Before winning the Olympics silver medal, Pec's best achievement in international events was the fifth in the 2015 Danish World Championship.
The jumping bed became the first Olympics in 2000, and the Olympics were the first to enter the finals for British women.
Reactions after winning medals.
Nathan Bailey, the only male contestant in the British delegation for the Man's Jumper Project on Saturday, was ecstatic.
Hannah Vylan, the gymnast who participated in the two Olympics, did not hesitate to praise Paige for what he did.
Paige has an honorary degree in biology at Sheffield University.
Rio Olympics 2016: Fiji fans celebrate the seven-man football gold medal
A 12-year-old boy ran over the sugar cane field and went to the nearest TV set half a mile away to watch the game.
After Fiji won its first Olympic medal, the celebration was extraordinary.
Banks are closed, shops are closed, carnivals take over the streets of the capital, Suva, dancing, singing and cheering.
In the seven-man football final at Dodoro Stadium, Fiji beat the British with 43-7.
Tens of thousands of people on the island put down their business and watched this historic game.
Fiji celebrated its first Olympic medal in history.
Many supporters, dressed in Fijian colours and rugby jerseys, bring their flags to cheer for the team.
At the sound of the last whistle, the irritated crowds of ecstasy rush to the streets, cheering and cheering.
"Some people even parked their cars on the busy streets of Suva and got off with the Fiji flag for the celebration, ignoring the light traffic congestion they caused... " The Fiji Times reports.
The celebration will continue until the weekend and next week.
Irish Super Football League: Finn Haup 0-5 Invincible Deli City
Aaron McNeeve was fined two points for the guest team in the first half of Finn Park.
With the 5-0 Fenhaup team, the Deli City team is in second place in the league.
Two dotballs in half the field of Aaron McNeeve, both of which were obtained as a result of the fouling of Lucas Schulbert.
Nathan Boyle won the game shortly after the second half of the game, Schubert entered the fourth ball, and then Keith Ward's late-dumb cast broke Finn Park.
The Deloittes are one point ahead of the Bicocks, and they're going to play a game of encounters on Monday night at Brandyville.
This is the first victory in the three games that the Deli City team has been confronted with in the northwest this season, and the poorly performing Finnhape hardly caused them any trouble.
Although the foul appears to be outside of the football area, after Charlene Cole broke with Schubert, McNeff hit the first ball in 17 minutes.
There's no doubt that the second penalty was the fall of Schubert by former Delhi City middleman Barry Molloy, so McNeff would again expand the score to 2-0 in three minutes after the first hit.
Eight minutes after the kick-off, Poear used a passback from Dean Jarvis to hit a ball calmly.
Gerald Doherty, the goalie of the Deli City team, spent a night of idleness, but he also made a wonderful rescue and shot David Scully in the best blank phase of his main game.
In 83 minutes, Schubert carried the ball through Cole's door, and shortly afterwards Ward crossed Finnhape's watchman, Richard Bush.
This game was the greatest victory of the Deli City team in the league, and it laid a solid foundation for a final female with the Kirk City team.
Large-scale failure of the Inverness College programme at the University of the Highlands and the Islands
The entire class of 20 students may not pass the advanced media course, administered by the Inverness College of the University of the Highlands and the Islands.
The majority of students in this course are 17 and 18 years of age and wish to enter university on the basis of what they have achieved in their studies.
The University of the Highlands and the Islands at Inverness College stated that the quality assurance process in schools was functioning properly and that the Scottish Council for Educational Qualifications (SQA) was also conducting an investigation.
A spokesperson for the Scottish Council for Educational Qualifications said that the country-wide High Media Assessment of 2016 had been conducted as scheduled.
All 20 students enrolled in this course, managed and scored by the Inverness College of the University of the Highlands and the Islands.
Many of these students are young people from rural areas who are taught online, but also have to travel regularly from their place of residence (e.g. Lohab) to this college in Inverness.
The father of one of the students stated that after her daughter posted her homework on social media without receiving any credit, at least 10 other students also showed up and said that they did not receive any credit for their course work.
He told the BBC News Network Scotland Online that about five other students studying the same course at Inverness College at the University of the Islands in Highlands last year had also been contacted to say that the same thing happened to them.
This situation means that his daughter cannot secure admission to the University of Glasgow, but because she has acquired some qualifications during her studies, she will be able to obtain admissions from another university.
However, the girl's father said that the other students who studied the Institute's media programmes were not so lucky, that they were now "suffering" and that they were not sure whether their course operations would be re-examined and awarded scores sufficient to enable them to enter university.
Inverness College is affiliated with the University of the Highlands and the Islands.
Diana Rawlinson, Dean and Chief Executive Officer, Inverness College, University of the Highlands and the Islands, said, "We take the results and academic achievements of our students very seriously."
The excellent HMIE report we obtained earlier this year and the continuous progress we have achieved over the years in the fields of continuing and higher education are evidence of this.
As we do every year, we are reviewing all published achievements and comparing them with the expected scores of each student.
For this particular course, there is a regular quality assurance process, and the credit-granting authority reviewers recently reported that "the award and management of the credit have a significant advantage" and confirmed that "the assessment judgement is in line with national standards".
At our request, the Scottish Council for Education is currently investigating the matter.
A spokesperson for the Scottish Council for Educational Qualifications said, "We are pleased that the High Media Assessment in 2016, as expected, provides candidates with an opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the subject."
Many of the candidates showed strong performance, and we saw a slight increase in A-C compliance in the case of qualifications compared to last year.
The examinations were designed in accordance with the previous papers and sample papers and in accordance with our curriculum and evaluation norms.
The two brothers in the Kilmanok Sword Blood Wash were sentenced to prison.
Jason Brighton was attacked with a samurai knife, a dagger and a double baton.
Two male suspects were imprisoned for drug-related robbery and subsequent "blood wash" in East Al County, killing a man with a samurai knife.
The victim, Jason Bradon, aged 38, was repeatedly stabbed on 5 July 2015 in an attack on his home in Kilmanok.
In the High Court of Glasgow, James Clark, 36 years old, charged with murder and sentenced to at least 22 years ' imprisonment.
His brother John, 38 years old, charged with less serious manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years ' imprisonment.
In sentencing the brothers to prison, Judge Bill Dunlop pointed out that they were carrying out a cruel, heartless, barbaric attack.
He rejects any argument that Mr. Braden has been waiting for them to show up with a samurai knife.
Judge Dunlop added: "You conspired to break in with at least one dagger and two truncheons."
Although Jason Bradon may be a drug dealer, he's also a son, a father and a friend.
You killed him.
After both were sentenced to prison, Detective Inspector David Moran, who solved the case, said, "James Clark and John Clark's brutal acts led to the death of Jason Brighton."
It's heartbreaking to be killed at the age of 38 and in such terrible circumstances, while the families of the victims are forced to endure.
According to statements heard earlier by the Court, the brother from Kilmanok decided to take a gold bracelet from Mr. Braden, which they delivered to him in exchange for drugs.
The two men went to the victim's home after drinking and using drugs, covering their faces with a scarf and holding a dagger and a martial arts truncheon.
The killer's sword is believed to be the object of the deceased.
Neighbors said they could see the Clark Brothers attacking Mr. Brighton because he was sitting on the couch next to the window and could hear him screaming.
In his address to the court, the prosecutor, Richard Goddard, said: "A continuing, insane attack on the victim..."
Then the murder scene was described as a "blood wash."
In addition to the stab wounds, Mr. Braden suffered blunt trauma during the attack.
Three days later, he died at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmanok.
The brothers denied the murder.
At the time of the testimony, James Clark, who had 38 priors, including one attempted murder, said, "I didn't intend to do it. It was an accident."
There were 23 priors, John Clark, who stated that he was only involved in helping his brother, who claimed that he was being attacked by Mr. Braden.
Men died in prison for shaking their babies.
David Sinclair admitted to killing his children at his home in East Kilbride in 2012.
The man, who was so angry that he couldn't feed him, was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison for killing his youngest son.
On 6 December 2012, David Sinclair rocked Joshua, four months old, in a state of "one moment out of control" at his home in Kiirbride East of South Lanak County.
The cause of death was discovered after a case review by a medical expert.
Thirty-four-year-old Sinclair was initially charged with murder, but pleaded guilty and sentenced to manslaughter.
When the High Court of Glasgow sentenced him to prison, Judge Lord Blackdale said to Sinclair, "You attacked him through his son, who was still in his infancy, causing him to be fatally wounded."
You must have known you were shaking him, but you didn't tell him.
You only admitted what you did after a lot of medical research.
Your wife trusts you.
Now she thinks you're being misled and she can't support you anymore.
Lord Blackdale said that Joshua's death had a tragic effect on all concerned and added: "Nothing can bring Joshua back."
The court had learned that Sinclair and his wife, Christie, had taken Joshua for a swim on the day the child died and then went shopping in East Kilbride.
17:30, Kristi Sinclair went out to see her mother and sister.
In just 11 minutes, she got a call from Sinclair, and his voice sounded "shocked."
And he said to her, "Joshua's not breathing well. Come home."
Then he hung up and called 999.
The baby was taken to Hermes Hospital in an emergency and died at the hospital.
Initially, Joshua ' s cause of death was not established, but the medical team reviewed the case and found evidence that the eye and brain were traumatized by non-occupancy at the time of death.
According to Dr. Peter Richards, consultant to paediatric neurosurgeons at the Oxford Radcliffe Hospital, "This evidence suggests that the baby has suffered more severe shaking than the normal weight used in daily life... "
Counsel, Royal Counsel Ian Dugt, told the court that Sinclair felt "extreme regret" for what he did.
Rio Olympics 2016: Chloe Tatton seems to question Yulia Yefimova
British player Tutton lost 200 meters of frog swimming bronze.
When the Russian player was ahead of her in the 200-metre frog swimming program, the British player Chloe Tutton seemed to question the controversial swimmer Yulia Yefimova's appearance at the Rio Olympics.
Yephimova was allowed to compete and take a silver medal after an appeal against a stimulant ban, and Tutton won a fourth.
And the 20-year-old swimmer from Wales said, "I'd rather be a clean race."
I can't help but wonder who's on the field.
I'm not happy, but that's what happened.
Even three days ago, Yafimova, the recipient of the military, did not know whether he was allowed to take part in the race.
Although I don't want to see people being denied access to this movement, I don't think that's the right thing to do.
She shouldn't be in the game, and a 20-year-old English player deserves a medal.
Kim Doo Ribbon defeated Yafimova, the Yasfimova winner, and won the seventh gold medal for the 2016 Rio Olympics for the Japanese team.
Chinese player Smurlene won the bronze medal, only 0.06 seconds ahead of the fourth-ranked Tutton.
Another British partner from Tutton, 20-year-old Molly Lenshaw, won sixth place.
And Tutton added, "Whoever faces it, it's a little frustrating to get a fourth."
It was a great experience, and I was a little disappointed with the fourth grade.
I lost my hand with the medal. It was a dream.
But getting into the finals is a great experience, and I'm encouraged by it in the years to come.
It's a bit frustrating, but it's gonna make me stronger in the future, and it's making me more eager to win the medal, and hopefully I'll be closer to the medal next time.
Tutton's 200-metre frog swim final was only a 0.01 second slow for England.
"Everybody deserves a second chance." Yephimova.
Yephimova said she was tired of answering questions about her past with doping and defending her right to participate in the Rio Olympics.
She was banned for 16 months in 2013 because of traces of a synthetic metabolic steroid found inside her.
The International Sports Arbitration Tribunal (CAS) provides that athletes who have previously been sanctioned cannot be prohibited from participating in the Rio Olympics.
The International Sports Arbitral Tribunal heard my appeal, and I won.
She explained: "If people don't like it and have a different opinion, they can go to the International Sports Arbitral Tribunal to express it."
I don't support stimulant use nor do I ever use stimulant.
The latter is not my fault at all.
Everyone should have a second chance.
When you drive and get a ticket, no one will put you in jail.
Ben Proud's 50 meters free swim final.
Earlier, Ben Proud made a 50-metre free swim final for a man who broke the British record.
Proud, 21-year-old Commonwealth Games champion, swam 21:54 seconds to the fifth-qualified Friday final.
Your delegation is rude and rude.
Indian sports minister Vijay Gore was visible at the Rio Olympics and often appeared on the stands to cheer Indian athletes and take a selfie after the race.
However, according to the Indian press trust, his and the many accompanying persons ' unruly behaviour apparently provoked the anger of Olympic officials who tried to break into the area without showing proper evidence and were rude in their language when examined.
Vijay Gore (photo taken in July) justified his actions.
On Wednesday, after Gore and his companions tried to break into the restricted area of the gymnasium and the field of Sword and Taekwondo, Olympic organizers wrote warning that if Gore did not improve, he would be disqualified from participating.
In 2016, Sarah Peterson, the continental manager of the Rio Olympic Committee, wrote in his letter: "We have received reports on several occasions of attempts by your sports minister to bring unauthorized persons into the area of the race to which he requested authorization to enter. "
Staff reported that when they tried to explain that the situation was not allowed, the line of ministers became aggressive and rude and pushed staff on several occasions.
The letter goes on to say: "If our ceremonial team learns of such acts again, your Minister of Sports will be disqualified and his privileges at the Olympics will be revoked."
The head of the Indian delegation called the incident a problem, but it was treated as a problem, while Gore himself said that he had done nothing wrong and attributed it to a misunderstanding.
On Twitter, he said, "As far as I know, we have always followed all the rules and regulations."
We are committed to the Olympic spirit and support our Indian players.
Otherwise, it would be a frustrating Olympics for India, and so far no medals have been paid.
Disappointing fans say in social media that Michael Phelps has now won 26 medals, as much as the total number of medals in Indian history.
Several prominent contestants have been eliminated, including the shooter Abinaf Bendra, the gold medal winner of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
He won fourth in the Olympics.
The writer and columnist Shoha de tweets: "This is a waste of money and opportunity."
But there are still some bright hopes as the contestants fight for money in boxing, golf, tennis, fields and, of course, badminton.
The Indian female gymnastics player, Dippa Kamaka, will join the horse finals on Sunday to brag about her two-week death jump, and the other athletes rarely try to do that.
For a country with a population of 1.25 billion, India's low number of medals is always alarming.
Analysts say there are many reasons for this.
The game in India is cricket, but cricket is not an Olympics project.
India has not invested much in the infrastructure and training of Olympic athletes, and the first jumper device used by Kamaka was made from the parts of an old motorcycle.
Parents traditionally pay more attention to learning than to sports.
And sports management has been plagued by corruption.
In 2012, the Indian Olympic Association elected a leader with criminal charges, in contravention of its statute, and the International Olympic Committee suspended the Association.
At the Sochi Olympics, the three Indian contestants were not even allowed to represent the country, carry flags and wear badges.
They can only go to the Winter Olympics as independent athletes.
The Jelelan flight from Boston to Sacramento landed in South Dakota, where people were injured by a stream.
According to the Colombian Broadcasting Corporation in Sacramento, a Jéréléan airliner was hit on Thursday night and 22 passengers and two crew members were injured and forced to land on an emergency basis.
Flight 429 from Boston to Sacramento landed in Lapid, South Dakota, at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time.
According to the flight, the wounded were taken to a hospital for examination.
Jaelan Air has indicated that it has deployed personnel to assist the wounded and that a replacement aircraft has flown to Lapid City to transport the remaining passengers to Sacramento.
DEA missed the opportunity to ban medical marijuana.
The answer is sad: unlikely.
This is a missed opportunity that could further delay the potential treatment needed by countless people.
So far, there's only one source of research-grade medical marijuana approved by the federal government at the University of Mississippi.
Today, there is a seemingly positive news that the DEA has announced that it will now also allow other places to apply for approval of similar practices.
The hope is that the amount and variety of cannabis used for scientific research may increase.
While this is to be regarded as a triumph in the field of research, it is largely symbolic, because no matter how much cannabis is available, it is meaningless if it is still difficult to obtain.
Imagine a product that is locked behind a door despite a lot of demand.
In response to the demand for this product, someone made a strange decision to make more products but not open that locked door.
Cannabis is this product, and cannabis is designated as a controlled substance that is the locked door.
That's what medical marijuana is all about.
Since cannabis belongs to a class of controlled substances (meaning that it has a high potential for abuse without currently recognized medical purposes), there are still important obstacles to overcoming opening this door.
Researchers who may need them usually go first to the DEA because they need a license to initiate scientific research.
Even after a licence has been granted, in order to study a controlled substance category, research institutions have to install heavy safes and advanced security systems, which require considerable expense.
There are also more subjective considerations that a study of a controlled substance may first be carried out with the approval of your academic institution.
Even if individual teachers want to carry out such research, the university leadership may not want to cause problems or potential effects caused by negative reporting ...
This was the case at the University of Arizona, when Dr. Su Heasley was fired after seeking a medical marijuana test.
Heathley finally had to seek private funding for his project, and in April, seven years after the original development of the research project, her pilot project became the first medical cannabis experiment approved by the Drug Enforcement Agency to study post-traumatic stress disorder treatment for veterans.
Then, after years of institutional obstacles, the National Drug Abuse Institute of the United States took the last key to the lock.
Today, it is the largest federal public fund to finance cannabis research and the only supplier of cannabis itself.
Even now that more medical cannabis is liberated for research purposes, the agency will have to approve any research it finances.
The problem, however, is the last word in its name: "abuse."
When I interviewed Donald Aberrans at San Francisco University for the documentary Weed, he said that one of the main responsibilities of the Institute was to study potential substance abuse rather than to study it as a drug.
In the words of Aberrans.
Even if a research client has served all of the above-mentioned obstacles, the barrier may still be open as long as its purpose is not the harm of medical marijuana but its benefits.
Think about it: a fast-track (admittedly unscientific) search of the National Medical Library of the United States showed that there have been 1,434 medical marijuana essays in the last five years.
The results of that search also revealed that only 57 papers related to the benefits of medical marijuana.
Most papers study the harms of cannabis, such as "The Bad Experience caused by the Neurosignal Interruption Effects of Cannabis", "The Insulin Inflammation of Cannabis" and "The Risk of Cannabis Use and Lung Cancer".
This imbalance reflects a highly false picture.
The road to medical cannabis research is paved by surprises and hypocrisy everywhere.
While the DEA continues to adhere to the classification of a category of controlled substances and sees no medical advantage whatsoever, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services holds a patent for a wide range of pharmaceutical uses of cannabis.
The DEA continues to classify cannabis, along with heroin and ecstasy, as a high-abuse potential drug, despite the fact that the DEA ' s own former Chief Executive Judge, Francis Young, does not accept this.
Under strict medical conditions, weed is much safer than much of the food we consume on a daily basis.
For example, a raw diet of 10 potatoes can cause toxic effects.
By contrast, it's not possible to eat enough marijuana to kill a person in terms of his physical condition.
The natural form of cannabis is one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to mankind.
According to any rational analysis, cannabis can be used safely within the normal procedures of supervised medical care.
Again, it's the opinion of one of the DEA's own judges.
Yet almost 30 years have passed, and little has changed.
Whether we realize it or not, we accept a certain degree of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we never have the strength to admit it, or we're so quiet and stunned that nobody seems to notice.
But for the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, it's worth the courage to show the truth.
The patient's life depends on it, such as Charlotte Figi, who needs medical marijuana to relieve epilepsy and many other patients.
There's a plant that offers so many benefits but is still locked behind these locked doors, which is worth discussing.
Bloody beet root: Donald Trump is the blonde Belusconi.
The bloody beet root is famous for electronic dancing.
According to these musicians, Trump has media dominance, just like Berlusconi.
The founder of the Electronic Dance Punk bloody beet root said to CNN, "You know, Italy was in the hands of Berlusconi, and for me, Trump was like a blonde Belusconi."
The Republican presidential candidate and the politician of the Italian media tycoon are known for their super-popular character, their skills to attract media attention and their ability to tell stories in the media.
Like the bloody beet root, Refort is well known for his electronic dance song, which he co-authored in 2013 with artists, including the legendary Sir Paul McCartney and the electronic music pop singer Greta Svalbard Beecher.
River was born in 1977 in the small town of Bassano, outside Venice, Italy, and punk rock was born about that same time, when this musician tattooed the number "1977" on his chest.
With his symbolic black mask on, "English is not my mother tongue, so I don't know anything about your country."
I've been trying to find out, and I've been trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Lifori sent Americans to watch "Television Politics", a documentary exploring Berlusconi's monopoly over the Italian media.
Lifford said that the documentary described "How Berlusconi drove Italy crazy" and added that Trump had a similar effect on the United States.
He said, "You can see how a man can reverse everything and distort everything as he pleases."
In my opinion, Trump is not a good thing for this country.
Two Turkish sailors were arrested and imprisoned for smuggling 500 million pounds of drugs in anti-drug operations.
Two Turkish men charged with smuggling £500 million worth of cocaine by boat in the North Sea were sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Following the discovery of 3 tons of Class A drugs in the Merchant Hamar, about 100 miles off the coast of Aberdeen, Momen Shahin and Amin Ozman were found guilty in a trial in the High Court of Glasgow.
According to the information received, the operation in 2015 captured the largest single case ever found in Europe in the case of maritime cocaine shipments.
Momen Shahin and Amy Ozman were arrested and imprisoned for their involvement in a huge drug deal.
The amount of drugs seized on board the ship is one of the biggest drug-trafficking cases in British history.
The drug ship is a Tanzanian-registered tugboat, routed from Istanbul to Tenerife, then to the North Sea, where the drugs are hidden in a specially modified secret cabin.
The smuggling vessel was intercepted by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Somerset and the Border Guard armed speedboat HMC Valiant.
The High Court of Glasgow sentenced 47-year-old Shahin to 22 years ' imprisonment and 51-year-old Ozman to 20 years ' imprisonment.
Judge Lord King Craven told two criminals that the quantity of drugs was "rather than huge" and that drug trafficking had a `destructive effect' on the general public and society.
The judge said, "You used a ship for the transnational trafficking of cocaine, in fact also transcontinental, and committed one of the most serious commercial crimes."
The judge told Captain Sachin that he was "not at the top of the drug-trafficking tree structure," but that he played an important role in the crime, while Vice-Captain Ozman played a slightly lighter role.
Officials on board the Hamar tugboat received a tip from the French National Customs Intelligence Investigation Agency that, after landing in Aberdeen, they had drilled through a steel plate to find a hidden cabin, found 128 bags of cocaine weighing 3.2 tons, with an estimated street black market value of approximately £512 million.
The Royal Navy boarded the mother ship Hamar last year.
Three tons of cocaine on board.
At the time of the raid, the ship's ballast was filled with tons of Class A drugs.
The ship was stopped in the North Sea on its way from Bosphorus to South America.
The entrance to the drug-hidden space was found under the closet of a crew room, and the opening was blocked by cement.
Shahin and Ozman were found guilty of carrying and hiding cocaine on board the ship between 20 February and 23 April last year and of being suspected of selling cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
The two men, who had been in the shipping industry since the end of their studies, were first-time offenders, who had accepted the verdict of the jury but maintained their innocence.
The charges against the other four men were found to be unsubstantiated.
The lawyer of Sachin, Jonathan Crowe, said that the married father with two sons on his knees was a proud mule.
He said, "Someone was involved in the transportation of drugs."
A man who can command the ship.
As far as the hierarchy of drug traffickers is concerned, Mr. Shahin is not at the top of the drug-trafficking tree structure, but at the lower level.
The absolute amount of cocaine on board means that the drugs have to be transported on cranes.
It took the police days to examine the ship in detail before the drugs were sorted into these boxes.
During the court hearing, it was informed that Shahin had been nominated as the captain of the tugboat Hammar in February 2015.
Mr. Crocoe said that Shahin was "drunk to miss the important stage of his 9-year-old daughter's and 13-year-old son's growth and wanted to go home to Turkey."
The men have not seen their families since their detention in April 2015, and their families are running for visas.
Ozman's lawyer, Di Moore, said that Ozman was "extremely eager" to see his family, but knew that it was still "extreme" in the foreseeable future.
Speaking after today ' s sentencing, the acting Scottish Crown Attorney David Harvey said, "The international drug trade knows no borders. In the name of our duty to abolish the drug trade, we are working closely to ensure that we prevail. "
"Scotland's pursuit of criminals is truly global in scope, and in this case we have given organized crime a major economic blow... "
Every cabin on this ship is packed with drugs, including space below deck.
This package of contraband was found hidden in the laundry room of the ship by a police officer.
Mr. Harvey added: "The case against the tugboat Hamar was discovered on the basis of secret reports provided by the French authorities and was able to board and inspect the ship with the rapid cooperation of the Tanzanian Attorney General, the registry of the ship ... "
" We obtained key shipping records in Guyana, and then our investigation extended from Guyana to Spain, where we learned important information about the stoppage of the ship in the Canary Islands ... "
We have also worked with our counterparts in Denmark, Norway and the United States to put together specific elements of evidence.
Although there is credible information that the Hammar is carrying a large quantity of drugs, the relevant British authorities cannot board and inspect international waters without the permission of the Tanzanian Government, which has never previously authorized it to do so.
The Head of the International Justice and Organized Crime Department of the Royal Scottish Public Prosecutor ' s Office stated: "The Criminal Justice Adviser of the Public Prosecutor ' s Office in Tanzania took swift and precise action to obtain the approval of the Tanzanian authorities to board and inspect the ship within 24 hours of receiving the information."
Under international maritime law, the United Kingdom cannot board and inspect ships with a foreign flag in international waters unless it has obtained a specific legal permit to act ...
We would not have been able to bring these people to justice if it had not been for the speed with which our criminal justice advisers had acted.
The cameraman, Brian Laumen, sees a rotten "Orient Express" in his eyes.
These are pictures of an abandoned train in Belgium by Brian Laumen, the photographer who lives in Rotterdam.
The photos show the rusty surface of the train, the broken seat, the dusty window and the tiny cabin of the pilot.
This is the car known as the Eastern Express, but it belongs to the Belgian national operator.
A city explorer took these remarkable pictures of the wreckage of a bus that used to be one of the best ways to travel.
Their glorious days are long gone, leaving only the cars and locomotives of the following vehicles to rot in the train station, where they become popular with photographers and explorers.
A 40-year-old photographer in Rotterdam, Brian Laumen, took these weird pictures showing the rusty appearance of abandoned trains, broken seats, dusted windows and floors, and a small mechanic's room.
Train cars and locomotives are abandoned in a Belgian railway station, but they attract urban explorers.
The trains were a luxury symbol from 1883 to 2009, when they operated with their legendary reputations.
This locomotive was introduced by the Belgian National Railway about 50 years ago.
After 126 years of running on the railway, the last train service, named the Eastern Express, took off from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, ending a glorious history.
The Orient Express, operating between Paris and Istanbul, is very well known.
In 1883, when the international sleeper company started operating the train line, it was called the East Express.
In 1891, it was known as the Eastern Express, and by the 1930s, it started a regular operating service covering all of Europe.
Don't confuse it with the privately operated Venice Simpson East Express.
The number of lily cars of the international sleeper company, which is still alive, is extremely small.
This photo shows that the equipment in the tiny engine room is rusting, that the meter has not been removed and that the wires are exposed.
Lauman says this cabin looks "a little claustrophobic and the locomotive's noise must be very loud."
These abandoned locomotives and cars have become a popular attraction for photographers and explorers.
After a visit to these forgotten trains in Belgium, Laumen said to the Daily Poster travel channel, "I can really feel the way this train was used throughout the season."
The journey was accompanied by a gentleman in a high hat and a beautiful lady in a dress.
Buster Brass, the make-up artist, Catelyn Garowe, turned into a "destruct."
Catherine Garowe, a Texas man, attracted a lot of YouTube fans with her impressive makeup skills.
But her latest role shift, becoming Buster Blast of Development Block, is quite incredible from anyone's standards.
In a three-minute video that uploaded to her "Kiki G" YouTube channel, Ms. Garowe slowly and methodically turned herself into that hook-hand shit.
At the end of the video clip, she even used some music from the play to create a brilliant, yet strange, atmosphere.
At the beginning of the video, this genius make-up artist shows her regular blonde hair, female self.
And then, with the clever use of time-lapse photography, she slowly turned into a bald, glasses-wearing "Mommy's Good Child" by Tony Haile, Bast Blas.
Ms. Garowe achieves this transformation by such means as coloured contact lenses, the mural of noses and eyes, and the painting of Buster's face on her head.
A smart way: she's slowly becoming Buster Blast by using time-lapse photography technology.
During the video, she also imitates the character and habits of that popular TV character, but with a perfect tightening of her chin.
The video shared on YouTube has been viewed more than 45,000 times, and online users have praised this cosmeticist for his skill:
"You're very gifted," an online friend wrote under Ms. Garowe's post.
During the video, she also imitates the character and habits of that crazy TV character.
"You can get into the role while doing this, and I love it this way," added the other netter.
The blogger, Caitlin Garowe, was Ron Swanson's role in Parks and Plays, and also succeeded in the marketing of the virus.
She said to her followers on YouTube that she wanted to make a face change every week in the near future.

Lancaster's father was denied access to his children's school for wearing a dirty T-shirt.
A father with two children on his knees was barred from entering the school where his children were in sports day by wearing an offensive shirt.
Let's get out there and t**t it.
However, although he realized that he had made a mistake and then turned his T-shirt back and apologized, the next day he found himself barred from entering the school grounds.
The single father was a four-year school director at the Park Elementary School in Cohen, Bernley, and because of the ban, he was unable to pick up his children, and the school staff even called social services and the police.
Craig Macbeth, a 36-year-old resident in Bernley, said he had been banned from school since his offensive T-shirt appeared on his kid's sports day.
Mr. Macbeth accused Principal Sarah Mickey of overreacting.
He said he was unjustly punished for wearing the T-shirt in a hurry to watch the two kids' game.
The father has now resigned from the post of school director, and he says, "It was a mistake, and it was my own negligence."
When I put on that dress, I didn't think it was a sports day.
At the end of the game, we had a father's race, and the principal noticed my T-shirt and said it wasn't appropriate.
I apologized for putting that dress back on, thinking it was over.
However, the 36-year-old father said that later that evening he had received an e-mail from the head of the school asking him to interview the principal the following day, but he did not think that was necessary because he had apologized.
Mr. Macbeth added: "The principal then called me and said I was forbidden to enter the school premises."
I found out that after the sports day, some parents went on Facebook and commented on the matter with some fuss, and it got a lot of attention.
A reasonable person would think it was an over-reaction.
Mr. Macbeth, editor of the Internet magazine Love Mini, said he believed that he could not even pick up his children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this prompted the school and social services to call.
The hit T-shirt had a picture of Lester as Craig Charles, the famous BBC comedy "Red Dwarf Star", with an iconic phrase for that character.
He said, "I told them I couldn't, because they forbid me from going to school."
Then I got a call from the social services asking why I didn't pick up my daughter.
The school called the police because I haven't picked up my daughter in almost 40 minutes.
Mr. Macbeth claims that he was told that he was no longer allowed to enter the school premises and that the prohibition remained in force until further notice.
He said he was also warned of a fine of £500 if he was found trespassing.
The headmaster of Park Elementary School, Sarah Mickey, said it was over.
"I can confirm that Mr. Macbeth has resigned and is no longer a director of this school."
It's over now, and I look forward to returning to normal school in September.
Senator Joe Cooney of Bernley said the school had clear policies and guidelines.
He said, "We all have to remember that when you assume a role like that of a congressman or a school director, it means that you have to exercise self-discipline at a higher standard. Unfortunately, he failed to meet that standard this time."
Congressman Jonathan Nixon added that he didn't think he'd be banned from school and that the situation was exaggerated.
Nixon added: "He was stupid in that T-shirt when he apologized."
Lancaster Police confirmed they got a call from the school but did not attend.
Sixty-five per cent of the Venezuelans wanted to take Maduro down. The question was whether they were willing to fight for it.
Two thirds of the Venezuelans wanted President Nicolas Maduro to be removed, but the question seemed to be whether they were willing to fight for it.
The day after the National Electoral Commission announced that "no time" for this year's recall of the ballot (and thus guarantee Chávez rule until 2019), the people of Caracas were doing the same, as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news, because I was watching the Olympics and watching Michael Phelps take two more medals."
At the beginning of 2014, Altamira Square, located in the eastern part of Caracas, was the focal point for violent riots in protest against the Maduro regime.
Now, however, not all the people of the country show the same enthusiasm when the opposition is called upon to exert more pressure than ever before to bring about a referendum this year.
Dejan said, "I want a referendum, but I won't protest in the interests of security."
Others, wiser people, are willing to mobilize in the future, but admit that the Venezuelans are not motivated enough.
The comments of the Chairman of the Electoral Commission, Tibić Lucena, attest to the fact that the Government is obstructing the recall process.
Sixty-year-old Roberto Reyes told Fox Latin that, "I'll join as long as the opposition calls for a protest, but I know some of my friends are scared."
Thus, in addition to the many obstacles that the Government has put in the way of delaying the referendum, the opposition now faces another challenge: to mobilize people to protest on the streets ...
Until recently, there was considerable support for the referendum initiative, with an unprecedented number of people mobilized at the stage of collecting signatures.
However, when protesting the government's drills to obstruct this effort, the crowds appear to be small.
Opposition Member of Parliament Sipuliano Eredia said: "Some people are focused on making food, while others are afraid of the many arrests and deaths that occurred in 2014... "
After Lucena announced that the next step in the referendum process (i.e. the collection of additional signatures throughout the country) would have to wait until October, the opponents of the socialist Government of the country declared that President Maduro and his followers were trying to disinfect the Venezuelans and convince them that it was almost impossible to hold a vote this year.
According to the Constitution, if a referendum were to be held in 2017, Maduro might be forced to leave his post, but he would be allowed to appoint a successor.
But if he's removed this year, he'll have to ask for a general election.
The United States Department of State referred to this issue in a statement on Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure that the Venezuelan people exercise their constitutional rights ...
The statement stated: "The remaining steps to achieve the presidential recall referendum need to be clear, concrete and implemented without delay, thus contributing to the speedy and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social problems in Venezuela ... "
According to Luis Salamanca, a political analyst who was a member of the Electoral Commission from 2006 to 2009, change is unlikely to happen soon.
He told Fox Latin that "I don't think there will be a referendum this year unless there is much larger social unrest and protest."
In his view, Lucena and the Government were breaking the law, but as long as the people did not protest strongly enough, they might finally achieve their purpose.
The opposition has called for a major rally in Caracas on 1 September to speed up the process so that the vote can be called off this year.
On that day, we wanted people from all over the country to come to the capital city to mobilize.
"The government will feel pressure," said Eredia.
But Salamanca thinks the situation can't wait that long.
The expert told Fox Latin that "they should respond more quickly and strongly to Lucena's announcement, which effectively wiped out the referendum."
Congressman Eredia acknowledged that some parties within the opposition were eager to facilitate the rally as soon as possible, but others wanted more time to organize it.
Now the opposition must be careful.
Salamanca said, "If people are discouraged by the circumstances, there is a risk that the number of participants in the second round of signatures will be reduced... "
The referendum process must have the support of 20% of voters in the country, that is, nearly 4 million people, in order to be effectively activated.
Salamanca and other analysts believe that even if the recall took place in 2017, Chavezism would be defeated.
Some people, however, are less optimistic.
Our party wants political change this year.
Eredia told Fox Latin that, "If the government shuts down this election path, we'll have to explore other legitimate options."
19: West Bromovich Team, Explosion 2016-17 season
The Guardian journalists are in fourteenth place. (Note: this is not necessarily Alan Smith's prediction, but the opinion of most journalists in this paper.)
It's 14th in the last season.
The odds of winning the League championship (by Oddschecker) were 1,000-1
The new season, as usual, until last week, the Sibramovich team looked the same: the 2016-17 season, led by Tony Pries, who was always pragmatic, could be another comfortable or stagnating season, depending on the degree of humility and care.
However, as Jeremy Piss sold 88 per cent of his share in the club to Pliss, who was known as a safe hand, the team immediately became the favorite of the lottery company in a market where the Chief Commander was often fired.
There has been a definite change in the situation in the Black Country, not only at the hillside court, but also a few miles northwest of Woolfhampton, where the new family from China unhesitatingly dismissed Kenny Jetit.
Mr. Lai dispelled his concerns and the entrepreneur declared that he wanted to maintain the club's culture.
When he took over the club, Mr. Ryan said, "I don't want to change the quality of this club, nor do I want to make an unsustainable waste."
I want to be a good boss and make a long-term investment in this club.
First of all, our goal is to make sure that we stay in the British Super Bowl, and then on that basis, I want the club to be in the top half of the team.
I believe this is the best football league in the world, and I want to lead this club as far away as possible.
According to Presley's records, the first aspect is not a problem.
The next goal is to get to the top half of the list, but for the new players and the increasingly divided fans who are hoping for a rapid increase in the ranking, it is important to realize that this is also an increasingly demanding task, as other teams in the ranks have been catching up recently.
More than half the team, based on the 14th final score of the last season, must have done more than step up the ranking.
Only the Astonville team scored less than they did, and it is worth mentioning that during Christmas, the West Bromovich team shot less than once every 90 minutes, once the worst-performing team in the race.
In 38 games, they didn't score in 13, and in only 9 games did they score more than one.
Of the 10 games they won, they didn't lead more than one ball in one game, and seven won at 1-0.
It's not surprising that, of their total of 34 rare entry balls, a dozen of them came out of the locator ball.
It's no wonder there's a lot of disaffection at the mountain court. Perhaps the most striking thing is the bad performance of the Astonville team at the end of January, which looked worse.
On the other hand, only the first six teams have a better defense record, but none of the other clubs would be able to argue for the regular maintenance of four middle guards.
Backguards are often underestimated, especially Johnny Evans, who is said to have been invited by the Arsenal Club after the recent casualty crisis.
The foot of the Northern Ireland played well in the European championships, and there were no big calls, and the Fassi Bromovich Club wouldn't let anyone go.
Ben Foster's goal is solid. They're in good middle.
Similar to Evans, Darren Fletcher also had ample evidence that he could still play a high level of competition when he was 32, while Claudio Jacob was underestimated.
Disturbed by the fact that the future of Cedo Bellasino is not over yet.
When Pis was running the club, both Stokes and Crystal Palace offers to Mark Hughes were rejected, but Stoke was still passionate and Mark Hughes was happy to wait.
After the end of the last season, all the parties concerned should take action as a matter of course.
This vanguard is certainly very talented, as Pliss has mentioned many times, and we've fought against him, but one thing is clear: relationships alone don't get him.
The Sibromovich Club insisted on signing the next replacement to release the former English foot under 21 years of age, but their plan to invite Diyafra Sakoga League with £15 million broke down a few days before the transfer, claiming that he had passed a medical examination and that everything was in order, but he had a back injury, which meant that he would miss the start of the season.
This put a lot of pressure on Venezuelan player Solomon Longton, who had some bright performances during the last season but needed to build on the nine-poll goal, especially in the light of Ricky Lambert's continuing poor state.
Looking back, the decision to let Victor Anechbe and Stefan Sesenion go was a little weird.
The slowness of Pliss in using young players in his career is notorious, and it is unlikely that three young players (Jonathan Lecco, Sam Fields and Taylor Roberts) who entered his sight in the last game of the 1-1 Pierville team in the last season will become normal.
He's going to go back to those who have been tested and tested, but Lecco's got a lot of attention.
The 17-year-old attack guard, the first 1999-born player in the British Super Bowl, was highly valued in the British Youth League.
Signing £5.5 million from the Queen's Park Tourists' Football Club, Matt Phillips will bring speed. He's the only new player who's going to open the tournament on weekends.
There's reason to believe that this could be a very busy round-up.
Speaking of what needs to be strengthened, Pliss told Star Express, "It's everywhere."
Every location you see.
Back-field players, middle-field players and front-field players, we're all going to have to strengthen.
Target's set. We know what we want.
The facts show that it is more difficult to obtain them than to imagine, mainly because of the uncertainty in the transfer process.
This season can be judged by their opening performance, starting in mid-October they're going to race in the cities of Manchester, Liverpool, Tottenham and Lester for seven contests of their own.
By that time, the pressure on Pliss will either be released or it will become more difficult.
Besides, even Bellasino would probably find a new club. Who knows?
The trustee supports pension reform, and the Tower Steel UK assistance agreement will be reached.
According to the pension trustee behind the Tower Steel British Company, the program may be restructured and will not enter the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), thus increasing the likelihood that the company will reach an aid agreement.
The UK Steel Industry Pension Scheme has a debt of £15 billion and a fiscal deficit of up to £700 million by some indicators, which constitutes a serious obstacle to aid agreements between Tower Steel England and the Tarbert Port Steel Factory in Wales.
After several meetings with the Secretary of Commerce and the Pensions Regulator, the Tower Steel has become increasingly confident about the future of its British business. The Tower Steel British Corporation has 11,000 employees.
The company plans to merge its European operations, including British companies, with the German conglomerate Tisenkhamper.
However, the terms of the aid agreement are that the British steel pension scheme needs to be restructured and that the government needs to provide financial support ...
Alan Johnston, President of the Pension Trustee, said that if the interests of workers were revised, the scheme would avoid falling into the Pension Protection Fund.
Although the programme is well funded in comparison with other programmes, reducing the deficit to Pound300 million on some indicators, the Tower Steel and the Tissenkhamp Group are keen to keep the debt under control.
Johnston said that the trustee admitted that it was "unreal" that any buyer of the joint venture or of the Tower Steel British company would pay for the current and future deficit.
He added that the modification of the scheme ' s welfare arrangements was a more attractive option than the inclusion of the Pension Protection Fund, which reduced the treatment of workers.
Tata steel sources warned that the company might still sell the Albert Harbour factory.
Since the start of negotiations in March on future arrangements for British companies, the company has refused to guarantee the future of those steel factories, which have been used as a bargaining chip with the British Government.
The executive director of Tata Steel Europe, Kushko Chatage, said that the Indian consortium wanted to make its steel business "more sustainable."
Chatage, speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the Tata Steel Corporation in India, said that negotiations on the reorganization of the pension scheme were progressing, but he insisted that the plan was well funded.
According to the Indian Times, Chatage says, "We are discussing with various stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the Welsh Government."
There is a consensus that pensions have some impact on commodity businesses such as steel, so we have to seek a structural solution that does not affect the further development of enterprises.
The pension trustee agreed to cooperate in the negotiations on the reorganization of the programme, which would be welcomed by the Tower Steel.
Possible changes to the programme include measuring annual inflation-related increases in benefits through retail price indices up to the lower consumer price indices, and limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law.
Johnston added: "The trustee and his advisers are the Tower Steel, and the government and pension regulators have provided strong evidence that the programme will be able to pay the revised benefits indefinitely and achieve low risk beyond the Pension Protection Fund."
Our investment strategy means that the financial position of the programme is not as affected by the recent decline in the rate of return on public debt as many other British pension schemes have, and we believe that the programme can provide modified benefits on a self-sufficient basis, as it has been designed.

The driver felt compelled to report to the police that the police in Ozhou had placed the parents suspected of beating others in administrative detention in accordance with the law.
Master Xiao is the bus driver of a kindergarten in the new district of Liangzi Lake, Hoshio, Hubei Province. At 0800 hours on 7 August, Master Xiao took the school bus to a village in the new district to pick up the school.
"We're two minutes late. Can't you just wait, why did you just take the car away and you're so irresponsible!"
Then one of the palaces got off, ran into Mr. Zhang, and then there was a dispute with Mr. Zhang, and the two sides ended up having a bad time.
The driver, Master Shaw, was beaten and bleeding on his hands, his head was cut with an umbrella and a headache.
"I'm just a driver, and it's not my responsibility to follow the route at the required time. "
Master Xiao found himself in a difficult position and reported the matter to his school bus company, which, after consulting with the company's leadership, decided to call the police.
On August 10, under police pressure, Miyagi surrendered to the Liangzi Lake police station of the Ozhou City Public Security Bureau.
At the same time, we clean up the production, sale, repair and adaptation of motor-related electric vehicles, their fittings and shops.
It is worth noting that the police are all administratively detained for disturbing order in public places where motor vehicles are gathered and waiting in public places, such as bus stations, subway gates, etc.
In the last six years, the average annual growth rate in the size of the trust has been 52.89 per cent, covering a wide range of areas such as funds, insurance, trusts, bank finance, pensions, cross-border investments, social goods, transactional payments, etc.
The Head of the Secretariat of the Chinese Banking Association, Huang Yuen, stated that asset trusteeship had become an important link between the currency market, capital markets and the real economy, and an important institutional arrangement to guarantee financial security.
With the rapid development of our direct financing and wealth management markets, the market position of asset trusteeship has increased.
Data from China's Asset Trust Industry Development Report (2016) show that, by the end of 2015, the country had recorded 62.74 per cent of Tobi, compared with 17.11 per cent in 2011.
Toby is the share of trust assets in the total deposits of financial institutions and is usually used to measure the position and role of the trusteeship industry.
It is worth noting that at present, our asset-hosting mechanism is not adequate, and in many areas it has not been strictly enforced or even incorporated into it.
The absence of an asset-hosting mechanism is an important reason for the outbreak of risk incidents in areas such as P2P network lending, private equity funds, etc.
The report recommends that an enterprise-wide, asset-wide, process-wide "all-trust" model be achieved as soon as possible to better safeguard financial security and safeguard investors' interests.
Each P2P platform is now required to draw up a huge risk reserve, which, as an asset, cannot be offset by the increase in the battalion.
In recent days, our city has organized a special training session on taxation in the Internet financial sector, and tax experts have advised Internet financial enterprises in Shenzhen.
At a training session organized by the Shenzhen City Internet Finance Association and co-sponsored by the Shenzhen City Registered Taxpayers Association, attention was focused on the many fiscal challenges that our city ' s mutual gold companies face.
" Under the prevailing winds of industry running, the P2P platform draws huge reserves for risk, which are undoubtedly an important means of stabilizing investors ' minds ... "
Hsien Shenzhen, President of the Fiscal Services Agency, Hu Mu Peng, said that it was not a small tax to pay value added tax as a risk reserve to the enterprise if it was not paid.
" But if such a product is established by the insurance company and purchased by the P2P platform, in consultation with the insurance company, it can be used for value added tax credits and the cost of the enterprise will be reduced... "
Chim Ping suggested that Shenzhen, as an Internet finance pilot city, could be a forward-looking attempt by industry associations in consultation with insurance companies.
There is a new story in the A-share market: the big deal is 3000 points in the air, and behind this, there is still a low level of sentiment on the one hand, and foreign investment is buying A-shares for seven months.
"I don't have enough confidence in what's going on up to 3000, I'm still afraid of the expansion of the new stock market."
The central change in the market is that the A share market, after extraordinary volatility in 2015, has entered the concussion market, that many events are pending, that the overall financial situation of the market continues to be weak and that it is very difficult to make money.
The Big Light Report states that, overall, the mood of individual investors remained low in July, and the amount of new personal funding continued to decline.
In July, the balance of securities market transactions settlement was significantly reduced from June, with a net change in silver certificate transfers of 66.6 billion yuan.
In terms of the number of new investors, the number of new investors in July remained low at a weekly average of 310,000.
The net inflow of foreign capital, such as equity capital, continued, with a net inflow of $8.7 billion in July and an increase in net inflows over the previous month.
The continuous buying of A shares by foreign capital also indirectly suggests that the internal attractiveness of the current A share market is increasing.
In the case of the diaspora, after a long and sustained inflow of funds from Hong Kong, it's all very good.
At the operational level, several changes are suggested: the changes expected from the opening of a deep port; and the hot-spot catalytic effect of semi-annual and three-quarterly reports.

The implementation of these pilot policies has been advanced by providing a sound financial services environment in support of the development of a demonstration project on strategic connectivity in China and China (Changqing), promoting open development in the interior.
Since the status of each year ' s application may change, the value of the settlement and the size of the residence may vary from year to year.
The management also provides for the introduction of a system of credit-based household publicity, whereby applicants whose points reach the required mark are registered only through the publicity chain.
In the case of units and individuals who faked the implementation of the policy, they will be disqualified from applying for the same year and for the next five years, and those who have already settled will be cancelled.
At the stage of the investigation of the case by the public security organs, two former cooperation companies, as well as the chairman of one company, the hotel company that was developed together, signed a letter of agreement between the parties on the issues involved in the case.
At the stage of the implementation of the agreement, the two parties brought the other two before the court, requesting the court to confirm the nullity of the letter of agreement.
In recent days, the People ' s Court of the Hiral District of Hulenbel, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, ruled on the case.
Inner Mongolia, the Middleville Real Estate Development Company Ltd., in partnership with the China-China Qingzhou (Beijing) Investment Company Ltd., has developed a real estate project, the Hullenberg Century Tenron Hotel.
With the co-financing of the company China Wai and China Qing Hong Kong (Beijing), Dong was the president and statutory representative of the company.
The China Qing Hong Kong Federation (Beijing) company, the Xianlian Hotel Company, after agreeing to allow Dong to complete his obligations under this agreement, applied to the public security authorities to dismiss the case and no longer hold Dong and his associates legally liable.
After Dong's good faith and full compliance with the agreement, the China-China Qing Hong Kong Federation (Beijing) and Tianlian Hotel waived criminal liability, civil liability, and the right to civil liability.
This letter of agreement, signed on 24 April 2014, states that the Quartet agreed on the misappropriation and return of the misappropriation of funds by Dong-Jo and his subordinates.
The agreement includes, inter alia, the amount and time of the refund of the funds by Dong-hoon, the transfer of the shares of the company at the Hotel Tien-Lung and the change of the legal representative.
In October 2015, the two parties to the letter of agreement — China Wai and Dong-fung — brought the two other parties to the agreement — China Qing Hong Kong (Beijing) and Quasi Teng Hotel — before the court.
The defence responded that the public security organs conducted a judicial audit, which resulted in the misappropriation of more than $29 million by Dong-yi and the accountant.
In February 2014, Dong Tung actively contacted China Qing Hong Kong Federation (Beijing) and signed a letter of agreement during negotiations in the conference room of the public security organs.
Dong-bong also pleaded guilty and repented and asked for an understanding, and returned $5 million of the company's funds.
The plaintiff commissioned an agent to argue that Mr. Dong, after consulting a jurist, found it controversial whether the act of "lending" was a crime.
The letter of agreement was signed on the premise that Dong-ho had been found guilty of misappropriation in violation of article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Criminal accountability and transfer of shares fall within different areas of law, which cannot be confused, not traded, not to change "exemption" or "contracts" to cover up illegal purposes in a legitimate form.
In the plaintiff ' s view, criminal liability is the public authority exercised by statutory organs of the State, such as the Public Prosecution Act, and is not governed by private agreements ...
The agreement signed by the parties on 24 April 2014 violates the mandatory provisions of national laws and regulations and violates the public interest ...
Therefore, the agreement to waive criminal liability is null and void, regardless of whether or not it constitutes a crime.
In the opinion of the defendant's representative, the nature of the letter of agreement was that the criminal proceedings were under way and that the suspect had reached a civil understanding with the victim.
The letter of agreement was established and fulfilled in order to maximize the financial loss of the victim and to enable the suspect to receive a lighter penalty, which is not an unlawful purpose and does not violate the mandatory provisions of the laws and regulations.
The signing of the letter of agreement is a genuine expression of the validity of the signature stamp of the parties.
The defence argued that "post-grabbing" and "misappropriation of funds" were public prosecution cases, and that the decision to dismiss the case was left to the public security authorities, not to the source.
The letter of agreement merely agreed that when Dong-Jo fulfilled the agreement, the victim applied to the public security authorities to dismiss the case, without conflicting with the exercise of the public authority to prosecute the crime.
At the same time, the Court held that the liability for breach of the agreement extends beyond the liability of ordinary civil agreements; the validity of the agreement shall be reviewed in criminal proceedings ...
Upon receipt of the warning, the Yang Quan City Public Security Bureau promptly and carefully prepared the emergency disposal plan and set up a disposal command, clearly defined the division of tasks, refined the measures of work, implemented the responsibilities of the work, and deployed fully.
At present, the public security organs are still investigating further other offences and offences allegedly committed against members of the group.
In the plaintiff ' s view, the two hospitals had several errors and errors in the treatment of the plaintiffs, and demanded that the two hospitals pay damages of $83,3815 and bring the two hospitals before the courts.
If it were merely a matter of fact, the case would increase the public's liability and extend the time for the resolution of a patient's dispute.
The Minister of the Interior of the state of North Wales, Ralph Yeeger, stated that the North State police would take all action within their competence to prevent juveniles from being brainwashed by religious extremist ideas ...

What's bothering the U.S. Air Force is that the airline pays a lot of money to cut the horns out of the Air Force pilots.
James said that the airline was "expected to recruit more pilots", and that the government would have to raise the Air Force pilots' prizes.

Goldfin laments that the shortage of pilots is a crisis, that the advantage of the air is not born in the United States, but acquired by battle.
Goldfin states that although the current shortage of pilots has not affected United States operations in Iraq, Syria and Libya, these operations have had an impact on the pilots ' choice of choice.

According to Reed van, head of the planetarium, due to the gravity of Jupiter, in 2016 the peak flow of Anglican meteor showers was higher than in previous years and was expected to reach 150 per hour.
The Anglican meteor shower is one of the three meteor showers in the northern hemisphere and the most appropriate meteor shower to observe.
"Accepting meteor showers requires finding a place full of stars, far from urban lights."

The surface of the palace is adapted to the geographical characteristics of the Beijing area, and the overall trend is high and low in the north and south, low in the middle and slightly steep in the slopes.
Of these, the North Gate Watami flattened at 46.05 metres, the South Gate noon flattened at 44.28 metres and the North-South flattened at about 2 metres, creating favourable conditions for natural drainage and slow discharge of water.
And the system of drainage in the palace is so huge that the ancient gully that has been retained so far is more than 15 kilometres long, with the dark gully nearly 13 kilometres long.
And all the drains in the palace lead to the Inner Golden River, which is connected to the moated river, which is 52 metres wide, outside the walls of the Palace, and to the surrounding outer Golden River, the Central South Sea, etc.
During the successive inspections, the damaged structures were replaced in a timely manner by the staff of the Palace to ensure the flow of drains in the rain.

Kyouta made the above statement yesterday afternoon in a routine press conference at the Commission on the Status of Women.
He said that the Commission attached great importance to the results of the cross-Strait study of the think tank and would serve as a reference for "governance".

The journalist learned from China Railways that on August 12, Beijing to Shenyang high-speed railways crossed the Changchun to Shenzhen high-speed bridge to successfully merge with each other.
The Beijing-Shen Yangtze bridge is 760 metres long, complex, technically demanding and controlled by the Shen Gao Liaoning section.
Since the start of construction in July 2014, construction has been carried out by various participating units and a large number of scientific organizations of railway builders, with significant scientific and technological innovation, which has ensured a safe and secure construction process.

"Don't look at the current gap of 4 metres between the river and the bridge. When the flood came down, the river crossed the bridge."
On August 10, on the edge of the Bing River, the town's deputy mayor, Kim Seong-seong, said,
"In the flood more than a month ago, the dam on the side of the river collapsed and a lot of rocks and mud fell into the river.
Now we're going to build a dam with cement, so that the shore will be stronger against the 50-year flood ... "
Kim said, "The workers are now making models, and in a month, the work will be almost complete."
" With this flood-protected shore, the dam could collapse at any moment; once it collapses, the flood will flood into the homes of the people on the coast. Now that we have built solid dams with cement, the flood will be able to move the coastal population more easily and reduce the loss of property ... "
Books, books, collections are a hobby of my spare time, and in my study, the collection of magazine originals is an ever-expanding subject.
In the spring of 1992, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a south tour speech to promote a new round of reform and opening up in China, and the cover of this magazine is a good reflection of the background of the times.
Top of the cover is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic plan to move forward with reform and openness, showing determination and unrefuted greatness.
Below the cover is the Shenzhen District, which is being built in the middle of the sun, and the citizens who come and go are busy working.
My collection is the original issue of the two re-entrys after the founding of the nation, and it reflects one side that Chinese workers have always been at the forefront of the times, contributing to social development and leading the way forward.
According to the data, at present there are about 700,000 visitors per year to the Conservatory, and according to professional statistical analysis, the number of visitors to the Conservatory Year should not exceed 800,000, otherwise it would be detrimental to the resources and environment of the Zone.
It is predicted that, with the success of the legacy, there will be a huge increase in the number of people travelling from and from the Middle and Middlelands to the Great Farmer's Box, which is to be commended for not pursuing the "many benefits" of tourists and tourism revenues, but rather for providing timely warning.
It is a necessary initiative to protect the Sanctuary's ecological environment and a path to sustainable tourism that enables people to live in harmony with nature and with the resources of the landscape.

Moreover, the Orion is a watershed between the Yangtze and Han Shui, where there is a river of perfume, a river of rivers, a river of south and a river of four.
"Springs at the top of the summer, mountains at the top of the autumn, mountains at the top of the ice, not enough oranges at the bottom of the sky, and the most difficult part of the spring, summer, autumn and winter" are unique and typical climatic features.
As a result, the Orion does not overexploit, and the protection of the ecological environment through sustainable tourism is well worth learning and learning from other world sites.
As the 50th world heritage of our country, China has become the world ' s second heritage country, and it wants 50 world heritage sites to be rejuvenated forever.
At present, many heritage sites have "reaffirmation, conservation, exploitation, management" issues, and world heritage has become "money-shaking trees".
It's obvious that if we look at the legacy purely in economic terms and treat it as a "gold job", then the future is too remote.
In China and abroad, there are signs of progress, such as that at the 2010 World Heritage Conference, six of China ' s world heritage sites were warned by yellow medals, mainly overexploitation leading to changes in the ecological environment of heritage sites.

According to the latest statistics of the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, Germany has received 240,000 refugees in the first seven months of this year, a significant reduction from the projected number.
In 2015, the influx of large numbers of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa into Germany, with more than a million refugees registered in Germany in that year.
According to Weizer, the head of the German weekly economy, on 11th, only 240,000 refugees have entered Germany so far this year, much less than expected.
Despite the decline in the number of refugees entering Germany, the task of the Agency remains daunting, with some 500,000 asylum applications still pending.
Nevertheless, an increasing number of refugees have brought the Directorate before the courts, some of whom have been waiting for more than two years.
By the end of 2015, the number of cases of refugee complaints against the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees for "inaction" was close to 2,300.
According to the Central Bank of Russia, the main reason for the growth was the re-evaluation of Russian economic expectations by the market.
Russian international reserves include foreign exchange reserves, gold reserves, reserve positions at the International Monetary Fund and special drawing rights.
Russian international reserves are controlled jointly by the Russian Government and the central bank, mainly in response to economic risks.
In recent years, as a result of Western sanctions against Russia and the fall in international oil prices, the Russian economy has been under downward pressure and international reserves have been declining.
In recent years, a lot of Hollywood films can be said to be a well-deserved major player in the film market. They're usually well-produced, crowds of stars, propaganda campaigns, and it seems that everyone's talking and going to the cinema to find out.
So, are these big pieces really like what we thought they were, like, rolling up a piece of money, full of money?
There is no doubt that the cost of production of a large Hollywood film is rising every year, far above the inflation rate.
According to the data in figure 1, there were 60 Hollywood films produced at a cost of over $100 million over a 10-year period from 1995 to 2004.
However, in the next 11 years between 2005 and 2015, the number rose to 197.
The sharp increase in the number of high-productions means that the average cost of film production has risen, which has also caused industry to be vigilant.
Prominent directors Spielberg and Lucas criticized the phenomenon at a forum event: if this goes on, the industry will be implosioned.
Of the 29 films, marketing costs were highest at 40 per cent and lowest at 24 per cent.
Physical copy, production of audio-visual products and their transport costs are on average $67.8 million.
It is important to properly estimate the number of copies and audio-visual products required, especially in the DVD market, where the "refundable" sales policy has been adopted.
In 2005, the dream factory produced 5 million "Monster Shrek 2" DVDs, but their sales were so low that they failed to meet their income targets for the season.
The 29 films will also spend an average of $36.6 million on income sharing and compensation, mostly by key creators such as directors, producers, screenwriters and lead players.
For the Hollywood studios, the revenue-sharing mechanism can help to reduce the financial pressure of the prior period; for the creators, it is also an incentive.
Of the 29 films, an average of 9 per cent of the income of the profitable film was allocated to the share, the highest of which was 18 per cent, and even the lost film had an average income of about 5 per cent.
It's worth noting that the creators would ask to be involved in the "earnings share" instead of "profit share".
It's because some of the movies that were made in the first place could be in a state of loss because of the operation of a sophisticated Hollywood accounting system.
For example, in 2010, a report released by Harry Potter 5 showed that, two years after the film was released, Warner still claimed a loss of $167 million, making the profit split a dead letter.
Hollywood also has to pay a bonus to the union of all categories of staff, with an average of $11.76 million for the 29 films.
In addition, the operating costs of Hollywood Film Corporation will be shared among the various films, with an average of $14.83 million for the 29 films.
After deducting sales taxes and cinema splits, the party receives 53 per cent of North American and 41 per cent of international fares, which generate approximately $169 million.
After deducting an average of $98 million in marketing costs for cinema distribution, only about $70 million is left.
With regard to the audio-visual distribution of the home, the 29 films received an average of $134.3 million in income.
After eliminating an average of $21.9 million in marketing costs and $30.5 million in production costs, the average net gain was $81.9 million, the highest income, and the profit margin was much higher than that of the cinema.
The pay-for-television channel generated slightly more revenue for these films than the free channel, with an average of $14.6 million for the former and $13.3 million for the latter.
About half of the 29 films received less than 1 per cent of the revenue from video spots, and even for films released after 2011, the share was 4.1 per cent.
Hollywood still has a more conservative attitude towards video spots when it's building these megafilm distribution systems.
In derivative development, the 29 films generated an average of $11.5 million by authorizing derivative development.
But there's almost two thirds of the derivative development revenue from the top two superb films, and only one third of the films make more than $1 million.
In addition to the above-mentioned sources of revenue, these Hollywood films have a fractional income from aircasts, music, and so on, on average, not more than $2.7 million.
Surprisingly, according to Stephen, the average profit for the 29 Hollywood films was $14.8 million, with a profit rate of 3.7 per cent.
Given the long revenue recovery process, this profit margin is likely to be difficult to defeat inflation.
Films with the lowest cost (100-125 million dollars) show the worst profit performance, with only one third earning the money.
And three quarters of the films at the highest cost (more than $200 million) are profitable.

According to the Japanese media, on August 11, Japan ' s Foreign Minister, Man-sung Arisaka, began a visit to the Philippines and held talks with the country ' s President, Mr. Durtart, to strengthen bilateral cooperation.
Japan and the United States are eager to approach the Philippines in terms of economic cooperation, with the intention of preventing the Philippines from turning to China.
On 11 August, Japan's Economic News website reported that Kishida would meet with Dutelt in Davao City, southern Philippines, and with Foreign Minister Assai, the Philippines, for the first time a member of the Japanese Cabinet met with Dutelt.
Kishida specifically travelled to Davao City, the capital city of Dutelt, rather than Manila, in the hope of early confirmation of the partnership with the Philippines on the South China Sea issue.
In late July, after attending the ASEAN-related meeting in Laos, a meeting was held in Manila with Dutelt, where the parties agreed to respect the South China Sea arbitral award.
Dutelt said to Cree: "In any consultations, the arbitral award will be the basis."
At that time, Kry offered to provide $32 million in assistance to the Government of the Philippines, and it is highly likely that Akida will again demonstrate assistance in connection with the construction of the Manila North-South commuter railway during the 11th talks.
It has been reported that Japan's rush to get closer to Dutelt is due to the fact that the Philippines is stepping up bilateral consultations with China.
It was reported that the United States and Japan have been increasing their cooperation with the Philippines, and that a new military agreement was signed by the USF in 2014, allowing US forces to be de facto based in the Philippines again 25 years later.

China has a bright civilization and a large population that has long been at the forefront of world development and is now the second largest economy in the world.
When we say that word, it contains not only too much meaning but also too much content.
There is no doubt that cultural self-confidence is raised at this time on the basis of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people ' s full recognition of their cultural values and their firm confidence in their vitality ...
Many have found that in Xi ' s series of speeches, articles, speeches, interviews, Chinese ancient books, classics, swoops and swaths, a high degree of cultural self-confidence has been highlighted and widely echoed throughout the world.
The rise of contemporary China has proved to be accompanied by a growing appeal for the influence of Chinese culture.
China ' s nearly modern history for more than 100 years has shown us that the path, the theory and the system are rooted in culture.
We've been thinking about Western learning objects, systems and cultures, and in the process.
After a long search, we found that China's firm faith in modernization is rooted in the "psychiatric genes" of the Chinese nation.
In Xi's speeches and visits, there are countless references to the Chinese culture of excellence, including Confucian thought.
In the eighteenth collective study of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping emphasized that China's development today came from yesterday and the day before yesterday.
He also said that for thousands of years, the Chinese nation had followed a path of civilized development that was different from that of other nations and nations.
It is not by chance that we have opened the path of socialism of the Chinese identity, which is determined by our historical heritage and cultural traditions.
In 2010, China officially made the second largest GDP in the world, but China has more than its economic achievement.
Since the 18th year of the Chinese Communist Party, China has placed the building of a socialist cultural power in a more prominent position and is committed to the creation of a new "gold age" for cultural development.
Both good traditional, revolutionary and socialist advanced cultures display unprecedented vitality.
Although Chinese culture has a long history and a very strong momentum, it is also undeniable that its immediate impact and impact are far from being as high as they should be.
Although China has experienced a lost time in the last few centuries, it has now returned to the world stage and in a more powerful way ... "
In an interview with a journalist, the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey, Mohammed Simsek, said that Chinese culture had contributed much to the world.
As Simshak said, China today is contributing to the world in a completely new way.

The purchase of preferential train tickets by a new student at a university on the basis of an admission letter is only for the new student himself, while the rest of the fellow students do not benefit from such a benefit.

Of course, in addition to the increase in the patient base, the increase in the number of female patients is due to the increasing emphasis on mental health.
Xu pointed out that in the past, in the face of psychological problems, a lot of people in their lives used to take a "hard" or evasive attitude to stress.
At the same time, the lack of awareness of depression and anxiety among the general public, which is misconstrued as a cause of the patient ' s mood and failure to provide the proper understanding and emotional support in a timely manner, is also the main reason for the low rate of attendance.
" Today, with the correct understanding of mental health issues and the importance attached to mental health, many patients and their families are able to face the situation properly... "
Xu said to the east that, as a result, more and more patients are willing to go to the hospital and receive help from professionals.

The "King England" law, known as the harshest anti-corruption law in Korean history, which requires public officials to accept a meal at a cost not exceeding 30,000 won (approximately 181 yuan) per person, will come into effect next month.
The Korean League reported on 10 that this rule has challenged many high-end Korean restaurants that used to serve politicians and senior civil servants.
A lot of restaurants have adjusted their rates, introduced cheaper packages, and some just shut down and re-routed.
The Korea League reports that many Korean restaurant owners are now grieving about their future performances because of "King-lan-Fan".
In Seoul In Temple Cave, there are politicians, government officials, media journalists and businessmen at the "Sagawa" restaurant since its opening in 1969.
The owner of the hotel told the Korean Associated Press that they had been proud for years to provide high-quality food and private meals to their customers.
Over the past 10 years, hotels have been offering high-grade packages, but "in order to meet the ceiling on the cost of meals, we will be forced to change decades of tradition, which is a tough decision."
Charcoal Burning Village is dominated by beef roasting, and its general manager, Kim Keeford, says the restaurant's brand-news is over 50,000 won.

In the face of possible economic losses, President Park Seok-hye 10 of Korea said at a cabinet meeting that it was important to keep the core of "King England" while minimizing its negative effects.
She said, "When this law is enforced, the transparency and equity of society will increase, the economic effectiveness will increase, and the economic growth in Korea may increase as a result."

According to the news spokesman of the National Statistical Office of China and China, on 12 August, Liaoning's urban survey of unemployment figures is higher than the national average, and internal pressure is greater due to the restructuring of its economy.
The Press Office of the State Council held a press conference today on the performance of the national economy in July 2016.
In terms of the broader environment, the international economy is in deep adjustment, recovery is slow, and exports to China, including to Liaoning Province, are under considerable pressure.
Domestically, China is in a critical period of structural adjustment, with the contradiction between the excess of traditional industries and the insufficient growth of effective market demand, and the throes of the restructuring of traditional industries being unleashed.
So this round of adjustment is precisely the depth of price adjustment for heavy chemical products, which inevitably puts downward pressure on Liaoning's economy.
During the "12th Five-Year" period, the expansion of real estate, the development of Liaoning's infrastructure were better and the real estate base was higher.
After entering the 13th Five, this round of real estate adjustment, which was based on a higher base, was much lower in terms of data performance than in other regions.
In conclusion, Liaoning ' s economic adjustment is a particular economic cause, influenced both by cyclical and structural factors, and by base-level effects, generally in the adjustment process.
Shing also reported that Liaoning's urban survey of unemployment figures was higher than the national average and that internal pressure was greater due to the adjustment of its economy.
According to data for the last two months, Liaoning's economy shows signs of stabilization, and the indicators are shrinking.
We are confident that the economy of the northeast, including Liaoning, will return to its former industrial base with the combined efforts of all parties.

Caracas news: Almost a year after the closure, the two countries, Venezuela and Colombia, agreed on the reopening of their border on 11 November local time ...
The above decision was taken following talks between President Maduro of Venezuela and President Santos of Colombia.
According to BBC reports, it was agreed that the first phase would open up the entry and exit of five border crossings between the two countries.
Following the talks, Maduro expressed the hope that the opening of the border would allow for the resumption of economic and trade relations with Colombia and improve bilateral relations.
Santos, for his part, stressed that the border between the two countries should be opened "in a step-by-step" and that all measures would be temporary, and that each step would be studied and adjusted at any time.
The two countries also agreed to work towards the reopening of all their borders, although this would require separate agreements between the two sides in the areas of security, commerce and energy.
On 19 August last year, a group of Colombian paramilitaries shot and wounded three members of the CNR National Guard and one civilian in the border area of the Commission.
Maduro subsequently declared a 60-day state of emergency in five cities of the state of Tachila, bordering on the border with Mexico, and closed the border between the two countries.

On the other hand, by means of administrative regulations, the disclosure of personal information is subject to liability, and there is a correspondingly strict requirement for defamation of the network or for maliciously damaging transactions, and administrative penalties must be kept in line with administrative regulations.

CBC commentators mistaken Michael Phelps for Ryan Rochett in the whole game.
An Olympic commentator at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC was embarrassed on Thursday night, and he confused Michael Phelps with his opponent, Ryan Rochett.
Elliot Friedman completely mistook the two men during the 200-metre personal swim finals. Phelps won the game and put his 22nd Olympic gold bag in it.
And while Phelps was winning, Friedman thought of him as Rochette, a compatriot of Phelps and a long-time opponent of the World Swimming Competition.
Friedman shouted, "In the end, he's gonna win!"
Ryan Rochette will defeat Michael Phelps in this race!
Phelps may not even be able to get to the podium.
But it was Phelps who won the race, and Rochette only got fourth.
The moment Phelps touched the gold medal, the CBC broadcast went silent.
Friedman immediately admitted his mistake. It's admirable.
I apologize. I confused the swimming lanes.
"It was Phelps who got the gold." He said.
The Canadian commentator was widely praised for his professionalism after the misbroadcast, and in the hours after the race, he confessed his mistakes again and apologized to the audience on Twitter.
I'm sorry, everybody.
I screwed up.
"There's no excuse," he wrote.
Meanwhile, with this victory, Phelps broke a 2168-year-old record and became the most successful individual Olympic champion in history.
Previously, the record keeper was Leonidas on Rhodes Island, believed to have won the highest Olympic championship in the ancient Olympics.
The future will be easier to find parking places in the happiest places in the world.
Disneyland has published detailed plans for the construction of an expected parking building east of the thematic park resort, a traffic centre and a new pedestrian skybridge.
The project, which is located in the eastern part of the resort area near Highway 5, consists of a parking building with 6,800 parking spaces and a traffic centre where visitors to the park can get off in buses, commuters, taxis and other vehicles.
A footbridge will be set up on Bay Avenue, connecting resorts, parking buildings and traffic centres.
The parking building, as well as the 14-acre-of-the-plane expansion project, is part of the $1 billion investment that Anaheim committed in exchange for a 30-year entertainment tax.
This project, known as the East Gate, will begin next year.
The parking building will be built on the Pompey parking lot in Disneyland, which has 1,300 parking spaces.
The transport centre will be built on the site of a commercial property purchased in 2014 in the thematic park.
The entire project is expected to be operational in 2018.
Ms. Susie Brown, Disneyland spokesman, said, "The East Gate Project is part of our major investment in Anaheim City and, as we continue to expand the size of the Disneyland resort, it will provide more parking spaces for visitors and help ease the congestion in the resort."
Four people died as a result of a bomb explosion in a tourist area in Thailand.
After voters voted for a new constitution supported by the military government, a series of bombings targeted tourist hotspot destinations in five southern provinces of Thailand on Thursdays and Fridays resulted in four deaths and many injuries.
Thursday night, the beach resort in Wah Xin was first hit by two explosions, followed by another explosion on Friday morning.
The town is about 200 km south of Bangkok.
According to the police, the first explosion resulted in the death of a Thai woman and the wounding of 20 people, 10 of whom were of foreign nationality.
Authorities have confirmed multiple bombings in the southern cities of Puji, Dong Ri and Wanren.
Two bombs exploded in the town of Baton in Phuket, and two others occurred in the town of Tusking near the tourist area north of Phuket.
In the last 24 hours, there have been 11 bomb explosions in Thailand.
Colonel Quassana Patanacharan, an official of the Royal Thai Police, stated on Friday that the bombings were not related to Islamic extremism but were deliberate acts of vandalism on the ground.
He said, "It's too early to make a quick conclusion."
But we are convinced that these events are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, that they are, in fact, deliberate acts of vandalism on the ground and that we are trying to identify those responsible.
Following a small bomb explosion in Hua Xin on 12 August 2016, investigative officers collected evidence from the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials stated that a series of bomb attacks against a vital tourist industry in Thailand had resulted in the deaths of four people and that the authorities were busy identifying the motive for the incident and identifying the perpetrators.
There is no conflict in Thailand that could lead to terrorists growing up on the ground.
"So we can say these events were not terrorist attacks," he added.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack and no specific group has been accused by the authorities, although the bombings took place in the same week as the Thai electorate voted for the adoption of the new constitution.
The three southern provinces of Wah Xin, Phuket and Tudor are opposed to a referendum supported by the military government, and the majority Muslim provinces of south-eastern Thailand have been rebelled since 2004 and have resulted in the deaths of more than 6,500 people.
These bombings took place on the birthday of Queen Sirikit of Thailand and on a public holiday in the country.
Hwa Xin is the home of the palace where the King of Thailand frequents his bed.
King Pumipo Adude is the longest-serving monarch in the world.
The Ukrainian question suggests: What is Vladimir Putin doing?
It's hard to tell the truth about these claims.
Ukraine denies it, while the United States and the European Union state that Russia has not provided any evidence ...
The Digital Forensics Research Laboratory (an open source analysis organization) found signs of a firefight on Saturday, but Moscow's exaggeration was hardly justified.
Russia’s distortion or misrepresentation of events for political purposes is known, especially in the fog of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
That doesn't mean Russia's claims are hypocritical.
Last year, Ukrainian civilian forces destroyed power towers that provided electricity to Crimea, some of whom were also involved in criminal offences and human rights violations.
An attempted attack in Crimea is not impossible, although there is little reason to suspect that the Ukrainian government would support such a conspiracy.
Whatever happened, the images found by the open source analyst show that the Russian military presence in Crimea has been escalating since at least Saturday (before the so-called attack).
These images show the movement of heavy weapons escorts on the peninsula, including coastal defence missile systems.
I'm familiar with, but disturbing with, the Russian-style escalation.
Some reports indicate that the Russian army in Crimea has already planned a new rotation at this stage, which would help to explain the activities in question, although by coincidence this coincides with the most tense period since the invasion in 2014.
Whatever happened this weekend, Mr. Putin ' s statement to Ukraine has undoubtedly escalated and has chosen to use this episode, whatever its trueness, for some greater purpose.
Analysts have pointed out that there are disturbing similarities with the earlier performance of the Russian military operations against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar rhetoric and military exercises provided cover for the seizure of the peninsula by the Crimean volunteer militia, which remained under Ukrainian control at a time when the Crimean peninsula only showed that the militias were in fact special forces under Russian military occupation.
In August of that year, with the defeat of Russian-backed separatists in Eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin had stationed his troops along the border, warned that they might need to "protect" Russian civilians in Ukraine, saying that they were being attacked.
He planned an aid escort to enter the area, but NATO claimed it was merely to cover up the Russian invading army.
What exactly did Mr. Putin plan in Crimea?
Some would like to know whether Moscow is planning another intervention.
The war in eastern Ukraine has escalated, as it was before the invasion in August 2014.
However, this seemingly similarity may be the focus, intended to create fear of military action rather than action, which would give Mr. Putin considerable leverage in the game with Ukraine and Western countries.
Mark Galotti, a professor of Russian affairs at the University of New York, said that Crimea, as a staging ground for military operations against eastern Ukraine, which is bordering the Russian mainland, not Crimea, and is better defended in other parts of the country.
Mr. Galotti said, "The Russians can't really plan some kind of major offensive."
On the contrary, "What we see is the Russian classic strategy of creating tension."
Mr. Putin ' s mechanism of international peace talks on Ukraine, which forced his Western leaders to avoid contact with Russia by annexing Crimea, has become increasingly futile.
By taking advantage of the pending threat of new conflict, Mr. Putin offered a new rationale for such talks: to persuade him to stand on the cliff.
Referring to the next peace talks planned for early September, Mr. Galeorti said: "This is a standard Putin tactic, and he wants to take a dominant position before participating in the talks ... "
The only real advantage is to say, "I can make things worse if I want to."
The position of bargaining with the West.
Mr. Putin also said this week that there was no point in continuing negotiations during periods of tension in Crimea, forcing the other parties to persuade him to return to the negotiating table, thus placing himself at the centre of this process.
What does he actually get out of doing this?
First, it allows Russia to continue to claim that it is a world power, even if its enemies are smaller than Australia.
Secondly, it gives Moscow the status of veto over the sovereignty of Ukraine and places that country under a certain degree of Russian control.
It also serves Mr. Putin’s long-held desire for a major deal with the United States, a logical solution to the dispute between the two sides over Ukraine and Syria on conditions favourable to Moscow, and an end to Western sanctions against Russia.
Since the collapse of Russia ' s enemies in late 2014, Mr. Putin has repeatedly suggested this objective, largely due to the decline in the value of Russian oil and gas exports.
Since his involvement in Syria last fall, he has repeatedly invited the Western Powers to join him as a major alliance against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may think that they need to ensure such a deal before President Obama leaves office in January.
Russian officials tend to view Hillary Clinton as a possible successor and more hostile to Moscow.
Donald Trump, although apparently friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
However, Mr. Galotti said that Mr. Obama was considered to be a man who sought a solution, not a conflict.
So there's a feeling that the window of opportunity is closing and that something needs to be done quickly.
At the same time, in the absence of any major deal, Mr. Putin would be happy to let Russia's weak neighbors guess what's going to happen.
One of the earlier versions of this paper was wrong about the year when Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea.
It's actually 2014 instead of 2013.
The congressional stand-off, the White House frees up money to fight the card.
The Obama administration said on Thursday that it was releasing $81 million from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health-care programmes to develop a vaccine against the virus, a non-conventional measure because Congress had not approved the new funding needed to deal with the virus.
In a letter to Congressman, the United States Secretary of Health and Public Service, Silvia Matthews Powell, stated that, without the money released, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority would spend the funds allocated to deal with this mosquito-borne disease at the end of the month.
The development of vaccines will be suspended at a critical stage due to a lack of funds at a time when the number of local infections in Miami is increasing.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of last week there had been 7,350 card cases in the United States, most of them in Puerto Rico.
Ms. Powell said that there were already 15 babies born with birth defects caused by the virus.
The virus can cause brain abnormalities and other serious defects in the child born to an infected pregnant woman.
The first cases of the spread of the disease on the mainland of the United States of America had emerged at the end of last month, and the political leverage surrounding the federal government ' s response had increased accordingly.
Hilary Clinton ran a campaign in Winwood on Tuesday, a town bordering Miami that has seen a series of locally transmitted card cases, forcing Congress to suspend its five-week recess to pass emergency funding against the virus.
President Obama and the Republicans of Congress have been disconcerting on the issue of HCV for most of this year.
In February, Mr. Obama requested an emergency allocation of $1.9 billion.
The Republicans rejected the request and requested more detailed accounts on the whereabouts of the funds.
For months, parliamentarians have been arguing about how much money should be earmarked and how it should be earmarked.
Last month, the Democratic Party rejected a proposal by the Republican Party to allocate $1.1 billion to fight the card, but it included a provision prohibiting the financing of family planning associations to provide virus-related contraception, which could be transmitted sexually.
This impasse prompted the White House to release $589 million from Ebola research funds in April for the fight against the virus, about two thirds of which was earmarked for use in the United States.
On Thursday, Ms. Powell said that her department had already spent most of that money and that it would have run out by the end of August.
Ms. Powell wrote: "As the emergency additional funding for the response to the virus failed to pass, the Government was forced to choose between delaying critical vaccine development and diverting funds from other valuable government projects to avoid delays for the time being."
The announcement was used by Democrats to accuse Republicans of failing to provide additional funds to fight the virus.
At a press conference, minority leader Nancy Pelosi called on the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, to put Congress back on track to promote such measures.
Ms. Pelosi said, "All possible options are being exhausted, and now we're going to the National Institute of Health, which is a preferred option."
Mr. Ryan ' s assistant said that the release of those funds was a long-overdue step by the Obama administration to extract as much political advantage as possible from the problem of the virus.
The National Institute of Health of the United States announced last week that it had begun clinical trials for a card vaccine on 80 human subjects and was expected to begin a second test in the "Full Cay Cox-infested Country" in early 2017.
However, since no more funds are available, officials have indicated that the study will stop on Thursday.
Ms. Poville indicated that she would transfer $34 million from the National Institute of Health earmarked for the treatment of other diseases, such as cancer and diabetes, to research on the virus.
An additional $47 million will be allocated to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to support the development of drugs and vaccines in response to public health emergencies.
This money will come from various accounts, including $19 million transferred from a plan to provide heating oil subsidies to low-income families and $4 million transferred from a plan to deal with drug abuse, such as opioid addiction.
Ms. Powell said that, even then, these additional funds would have to cover only the following month, and that by that time, if Congress did not act again, the research institute against the virus would have to "severe a lot of critical work."
Over the past four months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have spent $60 million to help states provide protection to pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen state preparedness and response plans for card outbreaks, and $16 million to help states create a data collection system to quickly detect symptoms associated with small-headed malformations and other cards.
Thai leaders believe that attacks on tourist attractions are linked to a change in the Constitution
On Friday, the Thai military head of government urged the nationals to remain patient while the investigators determine the perpetrators of this week's series of deadly bombings in Thailand.
The military head of government and prime minister, General Bayu Shaoga, hinted that the perpetrators were "some bad guys" who opposed the new constitution adopted by Thai voters in the national referendum on Sunday.
In his national speech, he said, "There are still some bad guys who were working until the referendum began."
Four people were killed and dozens injured in bomb explosions in five provinces on Thursdays and Fridays, including tourist resorts Puji and Wah Xin.
According to the authorities, other arson attacks in Thailand also appear to be connected.
According to analysts, these bombings do not seem to have killed many people, but rather to destroy the tourism industry, which is one of the few economic bright spots in Thailand.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Hua Xin.
Senior researcher Sunai Pasuk of Human Rights Watch said, "Whatever the motive, these explosions and arson attacks have shaken the military government ' s claim that the situation will remain stable after the referendum."
These attacks have created the effect of discrediting the authorities, terrorizing the public and undermining the tourism-based economy.
Photo of Thai rescue workers treating a victim who was injured in the Friday bombing of the Wah Xin bomb.
According to the police, they do not consider the bombings to be related to international terrorism or to the long-standing Islamic rebellion in southern Thailand ...
They described these attacks as "local sabotage", not terrorism.
The timing and location of these attacks have strong political symbolism.
The bomb blast occurred on Friday, when people were going to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikit, also considered Mother's Day in Thailand.
Four bombs hit the royal town of Wah Xin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most of the wounded come from.
A constitution drafted by the military would weaken the influence of political parties and give greater authority to the military, even after the military placed the Government under civilian control.
The junta ensures its victory by preventing opponents from launching campaigns against them.
Murray Hebrew, an expert on South-East Asia at the Center for International Strategic Studies in Washington, D.C., noticed that the Thai military suspected that the perpetrators of these attacks were disaffected voters.
He said that the bombs had "manifestly coordinated but clearly intended to create an atmosphere of terror and anxiety rather than mass destruction and casualties".
Last year, a bomb blast at the Bangkok tourist destination of Irawan resulted in the death of 20 people, most of them Chinese tourists.
Thai officials attributed the bomb bombing to the deportation of more than 100 Uighurs to China, which upset the Uighurs militants.
General Bayo, who has been leading the military group since a coup d'état overthrown the democratically elected government in Thailand in 2014, said that this week's bomb bombing had upset the Thai people.
He said, "Why now, when the country's situation, the economy and tourism are improving?"
We have to ask who did it for what.
Winner response: How does Simon Manuel's history look?
And as I entered the game tonight, I kind of wanted to get rid of my own black community, and I took it to this position.
But I really want it to disappear.
I'm so happy that I can inspire others and want to promote diversity in sports.
But at the same time, I'd like to see more black swimmer than just Simon, because the title of a black swimmer sounds like I shouldn't be able to win gold medals or break records.
That's not true. I work as hard as anyone else, and I love this movement, and I want to win just as much as anyone else.
The Colombian struggle for the protection of non-heterosexual students
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Arriger jumped out of a shopping mall in Bogotá, and his suicide note on Facebook quoted Pinkbye Cruel World.
His death was the beginning of a debate this week that has upset Colombia, as the struggle for greater rights for the LGBT community has been drawn into a broader political struggle that has plunged the country into a polar divide of views.
After Arig's death, his mother, Alwa Reyes, sued school officials for deliberately excluding her only son from the group after she found out that he was in close contact with a classmate.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia issued a final ruling in support of her view calling for more explicit anti-discrimination policies in schools throughout the country.
The ruling was part of a series of legal victories achieved by the LGBT movement, which was celebrated earlier this year by Colombia ' s ruling that same-sex marriages were legalized.
This week, however, their struggle for equality, the Minister of Education, openly gay Gina Perjotti, became a flashpoint for a scandal in the course of the ruling.
When the sexual exposure of a pornographic magazine began to spread on social media and the distributor claimed it was part of the instruction manual issued by the Ministry of Education, the controversy broke out.
Ms. Perrotti quickly revealed the lie.
While the Ministry of Education has provided guidance to schools on issues relating to sexual orientation and gender identity to help them to take note of the decision, it has not sought to impose standardized rules ...
In an interview on Thursday, Ms. Perjotti said, "What we want is for schools to have the means to resolve conflicts."
In a national debate on the theme "The future of a country torn apart by the peace negotiations between the Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), this dispute opened a new front.
The coalition of politicians opposed to the Government and the leaders of the Catholic Church mobilized at an extraordinary pace to accuse President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting same-sex unions and gender mobility.
In addition, the Government delegation that recently negotiated with FARC in Havana reached an agreement on gender and LGBT equality, which calls for a more inclusive policy by the Government ...
In the aftermath of the Colombian political scene, a 42-year-old Ms. Perrotti was strongly criticized by critics of the Government and the peace negotiations.
They showed rude posters at the rally, and some threatened to commit acts of violence against her and her partner, former Minister of Commerce Cecilia Alvarez Correa Glenn.
During that unpleasant week, Ms. Perjotti was very patient and tried to clarify misunderstandings and re-establish constructive debate.
She said, "Something that kept me strong and sober was that I knew that there were some kids out there in the middle of the closet. "
It's a difficult phase, and it's a very lonely moment.
She also linked the peace process to the controversy over LGBT students.
She said that, as Colombians continued to weigh the benefits of an agreement with FARC, it would be a turning point for the country to shake the world and they would have to consider the root causes of the conflict.
She said, "A peaceful country should promote inclusion or condone exclusion; should it provide equal opportunities for all?"
Although she was not happy that she had been the object of insult and harassment this week, she was pleased that in Colombia today, gay students could look up to her and think that they could choose to become ministers one day.

Ensuring the security of the electoral network — The New York Times
According to a press report published on August 4, "The United States seeks ways to stop hackers from reaching the ballot box," the government has been trying to find a way out of the voting box.
The United States Secretary of Homeland Security, Jay Johnson, has stated that the Obama administration is discussing additional protection measures for the United States electoral system ...
This change may be necessary and should be considered for immediate implementation.
The diverse nature of the cyberthreat and recent indications that some external actors, possibly nation States, have shown greater interest in influencing elections in the United States make it urgent for the federal government to pay extra attention to the security of the national electoral system as part of the critical infrastructure of the United States.
Not too late, Mr. Johnson should communicate with the thousands of jurisdictions in the United States that helped conduct the elections and provide the assistance, expertise and guidance of the Department of Homeland Security.
We have different types of voting infrastructure that make safety and security difficult, but this also tells us that the process should start as soon as possible.
The article was written by a senior member of the House of Commons Homeland Security Committee, a Mississippi Democrat.
In recent days, the British Government has suddenly announced the suspension of the British Cape Hinkley nuclear power project with China, which has attracted widespread attention, both at home and abroad.
Today, the British Government spokesman said that the postponement of the project by the British side did not mean that the enthusiasm for China had cooled down, that the Chinese and British were still cooperating in a wide range of areas, and that the United Kingdom would continue to seek strong relations with China.
Experts noted that Chinese nuclear power is at the top of the world in terms of technology, safety performance, operational experience, etc., and is relatively inexpensive.
Therefore, despite the fact that "nuclear power" will be tested for a certain period of time, the trend towards mutually beneficial cooperation will not change under the enormous co-benefit potential.
And the British performance on the Cape Hinkley nuclear power project is clearly hard to describe.
The project, when completed, will meet 7 per cent of the UK ' s electricity needs; it will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 9 million tons per year over a 60-year period of operation.
Analysts generally agree that the United Kingdom ' s own economic risks are being exposed, domestic political divisions are growing, follow-up procedures are cumbersome and future uncertainties are becoming a complex factor that together constitute an obstacle to nuclear power projects.
"The current decline in real estate prices in the United Kingdom, the emergence of capital outflows, and the stabilization of the domestic economy and the market system have become a top priority for the new British Government.
At the same time, after the Teo referendum, the United Kingdom will have to face a series of de-European procedures and re-establish relations with countries like France and the European Union.
Xu Mingqiang said that while the British new government wanted to be "different" from the previous government, it did not deny the positive effect of the nuclear power project.
But over the past 20 years, the development of British nuclear power has stalled, and most of the 15 existing nuclear power plants have reached design life.
According to the British White Paper on Energy, there will be only one nuclear power plant in the UK that will remain operational by 2025, when there will be a major gap in electricity supply.
It is for this reason that there is widespread concern about the British suspension of this project, which is a matter for the welfare of the population.
Scholeer believes that China can play a key role in helping Britain rebuild its infrastructure as long as it is in the interests of both countries ...
Liu Xiaoming indicated that the project will only be successfully launched to provide a safe, reliable and sustainable energy source for the United Kingdom at an early date.
According to industry, the nuclear power plant project will not only help the British to reduce the cost of electricity, but will also boost the local economy and generate employment.
Therefore, if the new British Government ultimately decides from the point of view of maximizing the well-being of the population, the future of the nuclear power project will not be pessimistic.
The British side can alleviate the energy demand gap, while the Chinese and French sides can find markets for their superior technologies and products in the field of nuclear power for the benefit of more people ... "
Despite the increased uncertainty about the Hingley Point nuclear power plant project, the high level and mature experience of Chinese nuclear power technology is certain.
In the case of the Chinese "Wallon One", which was scheduled to enter the British nuclear power market, it was designed to integrate the advantages of other advanced nuclear technology designs and to learn from past experience.
For example, in response to the problems reflected in the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, China designed a "steam generator secondary non-dynamic residual heat excrete" system that can release core heat in time to avoid core melting.
Liu Xiaoming stated that China has maintained good performance and safety standards in the development of nuclear power for more than 30 years and that its achievements in nuclear power development and regulation have been highly appreciated by international agencies.
Chinese-British relations are at an important time in history, and mutual respect and trust are all the more valuable.
China hopes that the British Government will continue to support the Cape Hingley nuclear power plant project and make an early decision to ensure its successful implementation.
In the view of the Co-Chair of the Central American-European Centre for Economic Strategic Studies of the China International Trade Institute, He Weiwen, there is not much time left for the British to make a decision, and the Chinese and British should make the necessary contacts and communication.
" The Sino-Arab nuclear power plant project was also put on hold following the change of the Argentine presidency, but after a positive move, the Sino-Arab nuclear power plant project is now clearly scheduled to start in the first quarter of next year... "

The Ninth China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week was officially launched on 8 August and 70 events will be held throughout the year.
During the earlier opening period, government officials from China and the 10 ASEAN countries, university principals, expert scholars, etc., exchanged educational development plans effectively.
In addition, it is worth noting that the second round table of Chinese-ASEAN ministers of education has been convened since then and that 11 ministers of education have gathered again six years later.

In recent years, exchanges and cooperation between China and ASEAN countries in various fields have been deepening, and cooperation in education has continued to be a highlight.
It is known that close to 800 cooperation agreements have been signed during the Education Exchange Week, which has been held for many years between the two sides, and that cooperation in the exchange of humanities continues to be a win-win process.
In the middle of this exchange year, the ninth China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week and the second China-ASEAN Ministerial Round Table on Education were of particular interest as flagship projects for the Year.
And a unveiling ceremony was held for the China-ASEAN Qingjin Vocational Teaching Centre, the China-ASEAN Orbital Transport Education and Training Alliance.
The successive "China-ASEAN Year of Educational Exchange" added closer regional educational cooperation objectives to the construction of the "China-ASEAN Destiny Community".
"China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week has played an irreplaceable role in deepening the exchange of humanities between the two sides by building "bridges of hearts, bridges of friendship, bridges of understanding".
Today, there has been a sharp increase in the focus on tumours, which may be highly correlated with the high incidence of cancer in recent years.
According to the 2012 cancer report, the country has about 3.37 million new cancer cases and 2.11 million deaths per year.
Cancer has become the leading cause of death in my country, accounting for one quarter of all cancer deaths worldwide.
Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells, which can affect almost any part of the human body.
Generally speaking, any part of the body may have a tumor, some of which may be transferred to the rest of the body.
Cancer is a genetic disease, but research has found that only a fraction of cancer is genetic.
Many factors influence the development of cancer, of which environmental factors are most important and can be changed.
Environmental factors include smoking, infection factors, radiation, pollution, food, nutrition, physical activity, etc.
To the hospital, the doctor told the family that Master Li was severely dehydrated due to diarrhoea, leading to a high permeability coma, that the situation was critical and that he might die a few minutes later.
According to statistics, approximately 20 per cent of diabetic patients may experience diarrhoeal symptoms, mostly in untreated or poorly controlled blood sugar.
Some diabetic patients even suffer from chronic diarrhoea, which is very confusing, leading to poor and misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Diarrhoea caused by indigestion improves with anorexia, nausea, digestive medication; bacterial diarrhoea tends to be very acute, several times a day, abdominal pain, and short-term treatments are almost curable.
Diabetes diarrhea, which is manifested mostly in persistent diarrhoea, no visible abdominal pain and no co-infection in laboratory tests, is significantly more frequent than 20 times a day.
In addition, some degeneratives, for example, may have side effects such as abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, etc. when they begin to take such degeneratives as diazine or alpha glucose enzyme inhibitors.
This is because, after diarrhea, if there is inflammation, there may be stressful high blood sugar and low blood sugar after diarrhea.
Moreover, because of the stress state of the human body caused by diarrhoea, the release of various hormones and the additional mobilization of a large amount of blood sugar in the fight against diarrhoea may also cause ketamine acid poisoning in severe cases.
Therefore, in addition to medical treatment for the causes of the disease, attention should be paid to the following after the occurrence of diarrhoea among sugar mates.
Diabetes with acute diarrhoea first have to prevent dehydration, so it is important to drink more water and to urinate more as a matter of course, both for extra blood sugar and for ketamine.
But don't drink caffeine, because caffeine stimulates intestinal worms and increases diarrhea.
Diabetes have an imbalance in blood sugar regulation during acute diarrhoea, and it is important to keep a close eye on the changes in blood sugar, preferably every three to four hours.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved field trials of transgenic mosquitoes in Florida in the southeast.
This genetically modified mosquito can help control the spread of mosquito-borne infections, such as the virus, dengue fever and chikungunya.
The preliminary environmental assessment report released by the United States Drug Control Agency in March of this year also concluded that the mosquito would not significantly affect the environment.
The report also notes, however, that this does not amount to authorizing the use of this genetically modified mosquito for commercial purposes.
Oxford Insect Technology is also required to comply with other federal, state and local government regulations and to decide, together with its local partner, the time frame for field trials in the mosquito control area of the Florida Islands.
In Brazil, tests carried out in Panama and the Cayman Islands show that this genetically modified mosquito can reduce the number of mosquitoes in the test area by more than 90 per cent.
There is also controversy over the use of transgenic technology for mosquito control, which some experts believe will have an unknown impact on the environment.

According to the Swedish Daily News, identity theft has become one of the fastest growing crimes in Swedish society.
Identity theft is a form of crime that illegally obtains information about the identity of another person as a means of falsifying the interests of another person.
Sifo survey data show that a quarter of the respondents in the past 12 months have leaked personal information in e-mails, cell phone text messages or other social media.
The Managing Director of My Safety, the Swedish insurance company, noted that one of the reasons for the high incidence of identity theft was the lack of caution in the use of personal information, which left criminals free to drill.
The Swedish police have reportedly invested considerable resources in combating identity theft since the summer of this year.
It is only if fraud is committed in the name of theft, such as shopping on the Internet in the name of another person, that it constitutes a crime.
According to the Swedish Daily News, the rental market in major Swedish cities is hot.
According to the latest data, the waiting period for one-time rental housing has been extended over the last year rather than reduced.
In particular, the housing waiting period for the capital city of Stockholm and its suburbs has been extended for up to two years.
Currently, the average waiting time for a one-hand house contract in Stockholm is at least 16.5 years, while the average waiting time for a first-hand rental home in the outskirts of Stockholm is more than 13 years.
According to the head of the Swedish Housing Authority ' s market, the market for first-hand rentals in the city of Stockholm has grown too fast, waiting for the source of housing to reach an all-time high.
The demand for first-hand rentals has reportedly continued to grow, despite the thousands of new homes in Stockholm being handed over this year.
According to the data, in the first half of the year, only 2006 units were available (for old houses only, new rentals are not included), and over 540,000 people have been queued in one room.
The Swedish Daily estimates that it would take 130 years to apply for rental housing if it were at the current pace.
The data for the last 12 months show that the housing crisis is not just a phenomenon in the capital city of Stockholm, but that there are varying degrees of prolonged waiting times for one-hand rental sources in the Gothenburg and Malmö regions.

A female spokesperson at the Westmoreland Emergency Services Centre described the injured child being flown to the Pittsburgh Children's Hospital about 50 miles west of the "Idlewild and SoakZone" theme park in Ligonier, Pennsylvania.
Park spokesman Jeff Crawshaw said in an e-mail that the three-year-old boy was playing with his brother in a roller coaster and that he was still conscious during the rescue.
Crawshaw said that the instrument called "Rollo over the hill" would be shut down for investigation.

Summers are hot and hot, and there is a marked increase in skin problems among young children, and their appearance is closely linked to sweating.
As long as the temperature is high, it's the beginning of a lot of parents' nightmares, children's skin itches, red rashes, red spots, and so on, always scratching and crying at night.

Although the cause is different, the symptoms are similar, with red rashes, red spots, and itches.
In fact, the causes of these skin diseases are similar, because the children are not "clean" enough, sweating, drooling much, not drying up in time, covering their skin.

In addition, the children ' s sweaty glands are growing, and some children ' s sweaty glands and skin glands are not yet balanced, with problems of sweatyness.
"Some parents get used to it, wear a little towel, see the kid sweat, and dry him up. "
"And the clothes are wet and the children are sweaty, and the skin rash is often seen on him. "
If the summer's too hot and the baby's sweaty, parents can increase the frequency of showers and change him to dry clothes.

The second bomb killed a Thai woman and injured several foreigners and Thais.
According to the local police, "three of the wounded were seriously injured, including seven foreigners, including four women and three men."
Following the incident, Thai police evacuated people and tourists near the site of the explosion and the wounded were taken to the local hospital.
The Thai police are currently investigating the motives behind the bombing and what kind of bomb it was used.
Wah Xin is a famous beach tourist city in Banwuri Province, Thailand, attracting many tourists, both domestic and foreign.
The city, located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok, is a summer resort for the royal family of Thailand, with several beautiful beaches, national parks, historical monuments and royal sites.
The World Health Organization (WHO) indicated on August 12 that travelling to Brazil to watch the 2016 Rio Olympics and Paralympics would not be at high risk of infection or spread of the virus ...
If athletes and travellers travel to Brazil, precautions can be taken to avoid the two main channels of transmission of the virus: mosquito bites and sexual transmission.
As at 10 August, 66 countries and territories had reported evidence of mosquito-based transmission of the virus since 2015.
Some countries or parts of some countries reported a decrease in the number of cases of HCV, but based on the evidence available at this stage, the overall incidence of HCV does not show any signs of a decline ...
According to the World Health Organization, in mainland China, although there has been an entry of the virus, no local transmission from mosquitoes to humans has been detected.
President Duarte of the Philippines said on 12th that he had called the United States Ambassador to Fifi Philip Goldberg but would not apologize to Goldberg.
The United States Embassy in the Philippines issued a statement on 12 December stating that the United States had noted reports of criticism of Goldberg, which was "unsuitable and unacceptable".
In April of this year, during the presidential election campaign in the Philippines, Goldberg accused Dutt of human rights issues, which were followed by successive and violent statements by both sides.
On August 12, Beijing time, the Spanish male basket beat Nigeria with 96-87 and saw a ray of hope.
Auguche's got 12 out of 7, two out of 10, three out of 24, Akonon's 12 out of 5 and Ebeckvi's 11 out of 5.
As a traditional European force, Spain has been pushed into a difficult situation by the absence of Major-General Mark Gazor, and has not even been able to get out of the team.
In the face of Nigeria, the team's weakest opponent, Spain also struggled very hard and barely managed to get past it at the last minute.
In the last minute and 20 seconds of this section, Nigeria failed to score, Rodríguez scored three points and Spain took the lead by 25-11 after five points.
In the second two, at 3 minutes and 54 seconds, Gazor is on the run, and Spain is still ahead of 40-27.
Six minutes and nine seconds into this section, Loul gets two, and Spain regains the double-digit advantage with 61-48.
And when Augusti scored three points, Spain scored four points, extending its advantage to 14.
But in the last 4 minutes and 49 seconds of this section, Spain failed to score again, and there were flowers in and out of Nigeria, ending the section with a wave of 13-0 and exceeding by 66-65, which was their first time in the field.
Nigeria scored three points in two of these waves, and one point outside the three-point line caused a foul.
In 3 minutes and 49 seconds, after Aminu's winning the game, Nigeria will have a score of 79-81.
When Augusti hit three points, Nigeria reduced the gap to one point, Reyes and Ghassol scored six points on a penalty and one minute and 15 seconds in the game, leading by 89-82.
On the evening of August 12, Beijing time, during the 22nd round of the Mid-Union tournament, Beijing's national security complex 1-2 was under the weight of Chongqing's sails.
After a few moments of adjustment, Dabao came back, but the trouble didn't really go away, and he was replaced by Song Bo at the 76th minute because he couldn't hold on.
Even worse: Dabao can't move, he was taken down by a stretcher, treated there for almost 10 minutes, and then taken to an ambulance.
And when it comes to the "foot of the land", Dabao's injury will affect the 12 strong races that will take place in half a month.
During this week's round-up in the Chinese Foreign Service at 0-0, there was an injury in Dabao, and he and Paulinio both fell in the middle of a heated robbery, causing injury to the neck.
The severe trauma of the match with Han was more disturbing and conservatively estimated to take a recovery period of four months, which means that Han will miss at least the first half of the 12th.
If Dabao's injuries are more difficult, the configuration of the country's front-runners will be greatly affected.
However, the engineers at the University of California at Berkeley advanced the concept by developing a very small wireless sensor to detect the state of health in the human body.
Researchers described their inventions in the magazine Neutrons, published on August 3rd.
Moreover, these sensors not only do not need batteries, but can also be used to stimulate nerves and muscles.
This may provide a way to treat disorders such as epilepsy or activate the human immune system.
This device has been implanted into the muscles and the stump nerve of the rat and is using ultrasound as an energy source and reading the collected data.
Sensors have been reduced to a cubic millimetre, called "neur dust," which contains a voltage crystal.
The author of this paper explains that this crystal converts the ultrasonic vibrations emitted from the outside of the human body into electricity to drive a tiny transistor inside the device, which is directly connected to a nerve or muscle fibre.
High voltage peaks in fibre cause changes in current circuits and crystal vibrations, so that echoes are detected by ultrasound receivers (currently mainly the source of ultrasound vibrations).
Since ultrasound technology is common in hospitals, and ultrasound vibrates can penetrate most of the bodies, it looks like a natural choice.
Michel Maharbiz is an associate professor of electronic engineering and computer science at the University of California at Berkeley.
As co-author of the paper, he said in a statement, "I think the long-term outlook for nerve dust is not confined to nerves and brains, but much broader."
Maharbiz and colleagues and Jose Carmena, neuroscientist at the University of California at Berkeley, led the study.
He explained that "it was impossible to use telemetry in the body because it was impossible to put a super small object in a very deep place.
But now, I can pick up a tiny object, put it in a nerve or organ, digestor or next to a muscle, and read the data ... "
In order to test their devices, Maharbiz and Caarmena use six 540 ns per hundred millisecond ultrasound pulses to drive sensors.
But researchers are confident that they will also work in the brain and central nervous system.
The neuro dust project was originally designed to depict the next generation of brain interaction and make it a viable clinical technology ... "
"If a crippled patient wishes to control a computer or a mechanical arm, you can implant this electrode into the brain, where it works for life. "
The two lenses work at the same time, distinguishing between the obvious and the background, creating a shallower view.
The Kumamoto earthquake not only devastated Japan's mainland, but also the world's digital camera core industrial chain.
Sony Japan's factory has suffered a great loss since the Kumamoto earthquake, and the status quo for digital cameras around the world is a shortage of goods and an increase in prices.
Sony developed sensors that were used almost for all cameras, and without their supply, the cameras were naturally unable to produce them.
And recent reports suggest that Sony is currently raising nearly $3.6 billion in stocks and bonds for the development and production of a stacking CMOS.
Sony is responsible for the supply of sensors, both digital cameras and mobile smart devices.
Compared to the news in the new format, I'd rather see Sony back to normal sensor supply, after all, the cost of the camera is just too much to see.
Macy's gonna shut down 100 stores.
The department store giant Macy's department store said on Thursday that the company planned to close 100 shops, a major initiative designed to help the chain out of a potentially serious problem: the company claimed that there were too many real stores in the United States in the age of online shopping.
Macy's department store regularly adjusts the under-country shop portfolio, often closing dozens of underperforming stores immediately after the annual holiday peak.
However, in a summer announcement, the company announced that 15% of the 728 stores under its flag would be closed. The chain company seemed to be taking a more radical stance than many retail counterparts, reducing the size of the shop to respond to the rapidly changing shopping environment in the real world.
Walkers and shoppers walk in front of a Macy's department store in New York.
The retail giant said he was planning to shut down 100 stores.
There are many reasons why Macy's department stores are trying to make a difference: many of the stores under the company's banner are located in small, regional shopping malls, where people's traffic has been hit hard by the rise of e-commerce.
Moreover, as buyers increasingly tend to go to discount retailers (e.g. T.J. Maxx) and fast fashion companies (e.g. H&M) to buy their clothing, the retail type of department store is generally in a difficult position.
These factors, coupled with short-term problems (e.g. a decline in international tourist consumption and untimely weather) have caused Macy's department store to go through a difficult period of more than a year.
On Thursday, the company stated that comparative sales had fallen by 2.6 per cent in the last quarter and that performance had been weak, although it had improved compared to the poor performance of 6.1 per cent in the previous quarter.
The retailer received $5.87 billion ($7.64 billion), which is 3.9 per cent lower than the same period in the previous year.
Macy's department store said that the closure of these stores could reduce annual sales by about $1 billion.
In the past, the closure of such a large number of stores could be seen as a compromise made by retailers as a result of their failures.
However, the company ' s stock stock skyrocketed by 17 per cent on Thursday, indicating that investors saw it as a positive sign of a stronger performance for the Macy Department.
In some ways, it shouldn't be a surprise for Macy to cut the store.
Macy's Chief Executive Officer, Terry Lundgren, said the chain was just too many stores.
Senior management has been saying for some time that they are developing a strategy to focus on about 150 of the best-performing shops and try to squeeze more sales in places that perform well.
Jeff Djinnet, who will replace Lundgren as Chief Executive Officer in 2017, states in a statement that all of the stores that the company plans to close are those where sales and profits have been falling.
Jeanette said, "We recognize that the returns on investment in these locations are inadequate and often fail to show the client shopping experience we expect from the Macy brand."
The company said it'd provide a list of shops to be closed down.
Macy's department store said that the company was still making a final decision on which stores to close, so it was not yet possible to determine exactly how many jobs would be cut.
The retailer will not withdraw completely from any of the first-class malls currently in operation, but will seek to close shops in underperforming locations.
This may not be good news for mall operators, who rely on large tenants like Macy's to attract and retain other smaller stores to operate in the mall.
Did you hide dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to the new findings, in terms of the amount of bacteria you'll be exposed to, drinking water from water bottles that can be refilled may "in many cases be worse than toying with your dog."
The website named Runner Review commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 water bottles of four different types (including gyroscopes, slide caps, squeeze caps and straw caps).
Every water bottle is used by an athlete for a week without cleaning.
Your refillable water bottle could be dirty like a dog's toy.
According to Treadmill Reviews, "based on the 12 water bottles tested, we found that reusable drinking water containers could harbour an alarming number of live fungi cells: more than 300,000 units per square centimetre (CFU) were formed. "
The experiment found the highest bacterial content of the slide-cap water bottle, with an average of more than 900,000 square centimetres of bacteria formed in units.
The bottle caps contain gland-positive bacterium, which causes skin infections, pneumonia or blood poisoning.
The second is a squeezed cap bottle, with 162,000 per square centimetre of bacteria formed in units, and a rotor bottle of bacteria close to 160,000 CFU per square centimetre.
The website adds: "Drinking water with these bottles may be worse than eating with your pet dishes."
The results of the soak cap water bottle trials were much better, with bacteria containing far less bacteria than other water bottles, with only 25 CFUs per square centimetre.
It's probably because the water goes to the bottom of the straw instead of staying in the bottle to attract damp bacteria.
The bacteria in the straw cap water bottle is described as "normally harmless".
The website says, "Based on the results of the experiment, we recommend the use of a straw cap water bottle because of its low bacteria prevalence and the low number of harmful bacteria."
We also learned that stainless steel bottles are a better option than plastic water bottles in the case of water bottles and bacteria.
In addition, water bottles with no cracks and difficult to clean spots are less likely to become bacterial hosts.
The website recommends that readers wash water bottles after each time they are used, preferably by using a weak bleaching solution.
Religion must be modernized before it's eliminated.
The US Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the latest poll results remain unchanged at the time of the election, the first female president in American history will be sworn in in January.
Last week, on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa Mayjing and German Chancellor Angela Merkel negotiated the terms of British withdrawal from the European Union.
Women living in Western societies have grown up to believe that they will be able to fulfil any professional role and succeed through education, commitment and hard work.
Today, young women can use as their role models some of the living people who work at the highest levels of leadership.
So, is the long and difficult struggle for equal rights for women finally over?
Hillary Clinton is ready to be elected President of the United States, but female leadership remains a controversial issue in the field of religion.
Well, it's not all over.
Women ' s leadership remains a controversial issue in the field of religion.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the establishment of a new committee to negotiate whether women should be appointed to serve as deacons of the Catholic Church.
In January 2015, the Anglican Church appointed Libby Ryan as its first bishop, and in 2012 a similar attempt ended with a failure.
Although the Jewish Reform Movement has appointed a female Rabbi since the early 1970s, since the 1980s there has been a conservative movement, and there is still a fierce debate in orthodox Judaism about female Rabbi.
In November 2015, the Orthodox Jewish Council of the United States issued a solemn proclamation declaring the illegality of female Rabbi, the Council ' s third attempt to resist the growing trend of pro-Orthodox women in the holy post of Li Rabbi.
It is ironic that, at the time of the nomination of the Presidential candidate for Hillary Clinton's takeover party, a group of American orthodox rabbis opposed to women in their holy post had launched a series of "hearings" on this controversial subject.
Why is there such a gap between the secular and religious spheres?
Like most sects, orthodox Judaism seeks to stabilize what it considers to be the continuation of traditional values.
This is reflected in resistance to the pressure to adapt to a changing society.
Those who oppose it are based on the fact that a woman's sacrosanct position is incompatible with tradition.
But it's not without a price to keep the tradition in this way.
The price of this loyalty may deprive the traditional community of the oxygen on which it depends, thus destroying the tradition itself against its wishes.
In the military history book of the First World War, "August Gunfire", Barbara Tachiman highlighted the dangers of tradition through what he called the tragedy of red pants.
On the eve of World War I, as the war developed from close combat to heavy artillery fire from further distances, covert soldiers could take advantage for as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to this change by replacing brightly coloured uniforms with single gray and brown uniforms.
However, French soldiers still carry the same red hat and pants, and they become very visible targets on the battlefield.
The French Army Minister Adolfo Mesimi's proposal to have his troops do the same is scoffed and rejected.
Red pants represent the honor and prestige of the army, and the military traditionalists are not going to give it up.
At a parliamentary hearing, the former Minister of the Army, Eugene Etienne, addressed France.
He shouted, "Are you going to take out the red pants?"
Never!
Mesimi later wrote, "The blind and foolish attachment to the most visible colours has led to cruel consequences."
Religious leaders who resist women ' s religious leadership are at risk of the same trap.
They focus only on the "traditional practices" of their religion without asking themselves the key question: "What changes are necessary to keep religion flourish?" Their risk is to alienate 50% of the population.
They also marginalize the entire community from the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women's groups can contribute.
As far as religion is concerned, it may be traditional to obstinately keep men wearing those pants, but, as revealed by the loss of the red pants, it may not be worth it.
Dina Bauer was the founder of the British Union of Jewish orthodox Feminism and an orthodox Rabbi student at the "Yeshivat Maharat" Jewish School in New York.
Charlton team fans can only get season tickets if they sign behavior contracts and agree not to denigrate clubs on social media.
While we recognize that everyone has the right to hold their own views, it is not helpful to post inflammatory statements on social networking sites.
The executive fan was then told that he had to personally go to former Chief Constable Cliff Egg to get tickets, and that Cliff Eger joined the club last month after 35 years of police service.
The letter goes on to say, "I need to remind you that you will be granted `conditional' tickets for the season, and you will have to sign a `contract of engagement' which requires you to exercise restraint in the future, not to post derogatory or inflammatory statements against the club or its representatives on any social media website, or to do any other act that may be considered antisocial in nature. "
The fan described to the Daily Telegraph how he paid to buy tickets for the season and then called the club, but two days later the ticket didn't show up and received the letter.
Yesterday, after he went to the club for an interview, he said, "They told me that my speech on Twitter had always been extreme and influenced the tweets of others, which I find absurd."
A holiday ride off the coast of Dalmatia.
What do you mean, luxury?
Former U.S. Navy Commander Colleen said, "I've lost my ass." She just completed a 25-mile bicycle ride along the rugged Croatian island spine, leaving a trail of sweat and a series of Navy-style noises in the face of a tough mountain road.
Some cyclists hum their hymns or recite their children's songs to distract themselves from the difficult climb.
Colleen's friend Patty suggested singing "The minivan did it."
Others either count the circle or put up with it, wondering how to get into what seasoned jockeys call hiccups.
Colleen curses in all kinds of vicious ways.
Riding a few yards ahead of her is like being chased by Hugh Grant in the "Four weddings and a funeral."
She and I had a week-long cruise on the coasts and islands of Dalmatia, northern Croatia, organized by Freedom Treks.
The practice of cycling in a steep terrain like Croatia may not be in keeping with the luxury concept of everyone, but it is said that the northern part of Dalmatia is easier to cycling than the southern part, that we use soft seating, and that when we filled out the reservation forms without fear and self-confidence a few months ago, there was a box that could only be ticked to ensure assistance to us with an electric bike, but we didn't.
The luxury part of the deal is that we'll be living in a floating home for a week, and that's the new melody cruiser.
At the end of the ride, we can dump our bicycles at the docks, with our guides Ivan and Ivana packing them up, and then we jump from the back of the cruise ship into the blue sea, clear sea, easy to distinguish sea urchins, sharp rocks and other swimmers, a place called the beach by the Croats, with long-barrel ovaries of the size of handkerchiefs.
The temperature of the sea at the end of June was ideal, and we all agreed that it was cool enough to look at it, but not cold.
If someone finds energy after a tough ride in the morning, there's a mask, a breathing tube and a few canals on board the cruiser.
But most of us would rather go back to the air-conditioning cabin, and Helena, the female massager on the boat, would have laid our bed, filled the food in the fridge and left a new box of chocolate on the table.
Ivan said it was important to do stretching after a bicycle ride, we practiced stretching in our own beds in the afternoon, or on the top decks of a soft chair, and the bartender Antonio was ready to offer his cocktails.
The melody is not a superior super tanker, but a stylish little cruiser of 42 metres long, with 15 cabins and half a dozen crews.
Of all the fishing boats and resort cruise ships in the small island ports, she is striking, and we are very proud to be part of it.
Colleen and Patty are friends of a web site called Meetup.com in Washington, D.C.: they call themselves "the 45+ sports and social groups."
Last year ' s barge and bicycle holiday in the Netherlands was a success, so they decided to try something more risky, and now they're in Croatia.
A small church competing with their church is on a cruise ship and bicycle vacation in Provence, and every afternoon on Facebook, you come to me to compete to make the atmosphere stronger.
The risk element of a holiday may be exaggerated, because if it's not strictly regulated, we're not keeping up with the schedule.
When we sailed from the glorious old port of Trojangill near Split, Ivan announced to the first arrivals that "Beat and dinner are scheduled at 8:00."
One bell on the ship means the buffet starts and one beep after the meal is over, so please be quiet and listen carefully to the next briefing.
Good moving except for the British, I'm afraid.
Even though it's funny and funny, even though I'm here, Ivana takes out the abysmal maps of the day, and we're all pretending to be bent around them, and the shadows and the routes of the rise and fall are freaking out, but everything else is a surprise for a bike hike from the coast to the coast in Croatia.
Ivan said, "It's like an electrocardiogram."
It's completely flat. It's not in the recommended range.
Ivan gave a brief presentation in English and German.
He's been dealing with tourists from more than a dozen countries for weeks, but we're an easy group (Swiss, Germans, Americans and British) and it's convenient to eat in two tables of English and one table of German.
We've all been friends on our way.
Friendship grows in the ride, and the only competitor is the topography, which means self-competition.
It's the most harmonious, relaxed group I remember.
We'll be moving to Ivan's wavelength soon.
Hard to climb a section is an uphill part, not confused with an uphill section, which is easier.
The hair section refers to a curved segment, while the straight section means a straight ride: it's simple but not always easy.
Ride instructions are always the same: "A column, keep your distance, it's not a race."
We'll meet at the docks at 9:00.
All right, so it's 9:05. I forgot you were on vacation.
It takes a lot of water.
We've been on a two-day north cruise from Trogill through the Konati Islands, where we're going to ride a long way along Dugi Otok, and then wake up walking in Traska Natural Park, looking at high cliff cliffs and salt lakes created by the introduction of sea water from underground corridors.
Swimming in this lake is said to restore youth.
If we go into the water, our feet will get younger. Will they be strong?
On a small island called Morat, we turned south again, improvising between the land and the nearby islands.
Most of our rides are on empty roads in the countryside, along open seascapes and various kinds of fruit and vegetables: olive groves, vineyards and thorns; in the air, the Mediterranean breaths and millions of butterflies fly their wings.
There's always a breeze on the way, but the shades are precious, so Ivan stops the convoy, and the cool little pool is a reward for the early riders.
This movement and social groups organize a number of group cyclists on weekends, they learn about the rituals, they do all kinds of reminders on the way, and they give way to the road during the rides so that drivers can move beyond them more safely.
When a truck tried to overtake a dead end and brake an emergency, a rider said to another rider, "You almost hit the head of the car."
Fortunately, they passed safely.
Ivan has divided us into three groups, with Ivana at the end of the team, to "get it" as Ivan called it.
When we have to cross the main road, we all gather, get out on foot, push the bike to the safety zone on the other side, and act on instructions and not make our own claims.
As we stood by the road waiting for instructions to cross, a Swiss rider asked, "Do you think Ivan realize that he's not giving orders to a group of children?"
Our afternoons aren't always free.
During our urban trip to Zadar, we visited Roman Forum monuments and wave organ, the music of the wave organ was like the groaning of the sea monster in the cage, the sound of music coming out of a pipe that opened up to the sea, and it was placed in a corridor made of rocks.
When we finish the meal and enjoy pudding, it's an excellent time to appreciate the famous sunset view of Zadal. After dusk, we return to the waves of the organ, and we appreciate the lights that are lit by the waves on the sidewalks of the glass, which are like the ground dancing.
When the melody sails early in the morning to Belgrade, where it's a hot resort, it sounds like the sound of a wave organ whispering in the ear.
The fifth day is a free ride.
A boat tour of the Kerka River at the mouth of the sea and its waterfalls; an afternoon tour of Hibeknik's penthouse, a masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance; a nightwalk on the quiet island of Zlarin, looking for local special corals — we had a very interesting day.
Lourdes was prepared to greet pilgrims despite the threat of attack.
People gather at the Holy Places of Notre Dame de Lourdes during the annual Catholic pilgrimage.
As thousands of Catholics gather for their annual pilgrimage to Notre Dame de Lourdes, French security forces are on high alert, as a series of terrorist attacks have only recently occurred.
August 15th is the day the Virgin Mary is called upon to rise, and every year tens of thousands of people arrive at the holy places of the Pyrenees to mark the Day of the Virgin Mary.
On the eve of this year ' s pilgrimage, Catholicism was adversely affected by the murder of an elderly French priest, who broke into the church in northern France and slit his throat during mass on 26 July by two Islamist extremists.
Two weeks before the murder of Father Jacques Harmer, a Tunisian (whose investigators claimed to have been an extremist as a result of the online Islamic Jihad video) drove a truck in the coastal city of Nice into the celebration of the French National Day, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks in 18 months, many French now have concerns about participating in public gatherings.
The number of visitors to France has fallen sharply, and the authorities are already worried that the number of visitors to the pilgrimage this year will decline dramatically.
However, concerns about the elimination of mass have not materialized, and some organizers have indicated that there has even been a surge in numbers at a later stage.
It is expected that there will be some 25,000 believers, including mass groups from Italy and Belgium, as well as about 200 members of the Christian-affiliated Orthodox delegation.
Many pilgrims say they won't chicken out.
A 66-year-old tourist Christian said to Agence France-Presse, "We won't stop living."
As one of the coordinators, Mathieu Giñar said, "It's important to show that life continues. "
We can't give up our faith, our faith and our way of life because some fanatics are trying to spread fear.
Since the Nice attack, France has cancelled a number of major events due to security concerns, including the large flea market in the northern city of Lille, and the European Roadbicycle tournament, scheduled to take place in September in Nice.
The priest responsible for the official pilgrimage, Fabian Lejon, said last weekend: "In the past week, I was worried that I would get a call to cancel the event."
He indicated, however, that the attack seemed to have mobilized believers and that the number of scheduled individuals had surged at the last minute.
Christian Grace, head of the local hotel union, confirmed that there were some signs of an increase in the will to take part in the pilgrimage after the attack.
The security of the holy places built around the temples has been significantly strengthened. In 1858, the Virgin Mary passed on to the poor shepherdess, Benadette Subitor, in the caves of the holy places.
Some 250 police officers and dozens of soldiers (including bomb disposal specialists and officers holding sniff dogs) have been deployed to protect the region.
Pilgrims in line through the security screening area are required to pass through a parcel search at the entrance to the site, where the original number of passages was reduced to three.
Catherine Simcocks, who travelled from northeast England to Lourdes earlier this month on a pilgrimage, described the strengthening of law and order.
She told the local paper: "Thursday morning, armed guards were deployed in the Holy Land, then the gate (using metal barriers) was set up in a single queue, and the parcels were searched during the process of entry. "
She said, "This makes my three children very nervous and afraid, they're familiar with Lourdes, and it's hard not to scare them when they ask why they are so heavily guarded."
It didn't ruin my experience, but I'm sad that it is necessary and I understand that these measures reassure some.
The route of the opening ceremony on Friday was also shortened, from the city of Lourdes to the Holy Land, and now the starting point and the end point are in Notre Dame.
Other measures include the closure of airspace in the city of Lourdes, the banning of flights, the blocking of traffic in the streets around the holy places, and the replacement of garbage bins with transparent plastic bags.
The French Minister of the Interior, Bernard Kazenaf, will conduct a security check on Saturday.
Lourdes attracts about 6 million people each year, one of the world ' s largest Catholic pilgrim sites.
Many visitors also brought with them sick or disabled relatives who claimed to have seen bathed springs in the caves of the Virgin Mary and believed that the water there had therapeutic effects.
As one of the organizers, Thierry Castillo thought this year's gathering was "a bit unusual" because "intimidation seems to have taken root in France."
However, he was sure to say, "It doesn't affect the quality and depth of the pilgrimage experience."
A 58-year-old volunteer, Françoise, is helping sick pilgrims, and she admits that the soldiers in the costumes are a little too much.
But if it'll reassure us.
Two people were injured in the shooting at the Zaragoza shopping mall.
A man opened fire in a shopping mall in the north-eastern Spanish city of Zaragoza, causing serious injuries to two people.
Friday at 11 a.m., this incident took place at the popular Atagonian Business Center in Zaragoza.
According to preliminary reports, the shooter may have hit a woman, believed to be his former partner.
The shooter escaped after the murder and is being pursued by the police.
Turkey's search for diplomats who disappeared after the attempted coup d'état
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who could not be called back to Turkey after the attempted coup d'état of 15 July.
On Friday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Chavush Olu, stated that 208 staff members of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been recalled from all over the world to Ankara in the context of an investigation into the attempted coup, and that 32 people were "unauthorized" and unaccounted for.
In Turkey, there are approximately 18,000 civil servants, army leaders and academics who have been arrested or suspended from duty, and whose Government believes they are loyal to Fatula Grant, who is present in the United States, and who are accused of plotting this attempt to overthrow the Government.
Grant, now based in Pennsylvania, is wanted in Turkey.
Chavushoglu indicated that a working group of the United States Department of Justice would visit Turkey later this month to discuss the possibility of extradition of Grant.
This issue has become an obstacle to bilateral relations between the United States and Turkey (NATO member States).
The United States opposes the iron-fist policy of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan following the coup d ' état, while Turkey ' s response is an attempt to develop closer relations with Russia.
Chavushoglu stated that two Turkish military officers in Greece had fled to Italy, that a military officer in Kuwait had tried to flee to Saudi Arabia but had been repatriated, and that two generals in Afghanistan had been captured and repatriated in Dubai.
He added that two Bangladeshi civil servants had fled to New York, while a Russian civil servant had gone to Japan.
The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryiet quotes military sources that Turkish military attachés in Jordan are also missing.

The Olympic organizers tried to clean the green dive pool.
The Olympic diver, who was scheduled to practice on Friday, found the pool closed on arrival because the Olympic organizers spent more time cleaning up the green pool to prepare for the first personal game of the upcoming Rio Olympics.
During the double dive on Tuesday, the pool suddenly turned colorful.
After the adjacent larger pool for waterballs and fancy swimming competitions was slightly green, the organizers maintained that the pool was safe for the game.
When athletes arrived to prepare for a warm-up exercise in the morning, the diving pool was closed, although it was reopened at 1 p.m. local time, two and a half hours from the start of the 3 metre jump.
The color of the pool looks almost normal, but it's still a little green.
The American diver, Abby Johnston, who was in the springboard race, said that she went to the pool for warm-up practice but was told that the diving pool was closed without any advance notice.
She wrote on Twitter that #FixTheSwamp should start trend predictions.
Tom Daley, a British sportsman from the two-person jump-off game, also commented on the state of the diving pool on Twitter.
Let's hope that means we won't be jumping in too bad a pool in the next few days!
Mario Andrada, the chief spokesperson of the local competition organizing committee, stressed that the pool was safe for the competition and that there was no problem with a three-metre pre-game.
He admitted that some athletes were worried about the pool, but said that it was due to cleaning of the pool.
He said, "We repeat what we've always said, this pool does not pose any threat to the health of athletes."
One or two athletes complained that they felt itchy on the day of the pool.
That's because when we see the pool green, the first reaction is the use of chemical chlorine, which is very common in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced the use.
We re-tested the pool, and it showed that the indicators were completely within the parameters.
Simón Langford, Chief Spokesperson for the Marianque Swimming Centre, said that the diving pool had been closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision had the support of the International Union for Swimming.
In a statement, Langford said, "The reason why the diving pool is closed is that the pool must remain static so that the diving pool can revert to its blue state as soon as possible."
Andrada said that the organizers were overwhelmed by the deterioration of the pool.
He said, "Chemology is not a precise science."
As you can see, something lasts longer than expected.
The rain of the last few days has even made it more difficult to get the water color back on track.
Andrada says, "It doesn't help to improve the situation."
He added that athletes could be trained on land in the morning, but admitted that the arrangement was "undesirable".
He explained that the coloring of the pool was due to an increase in the alkaline level, similar to the fact that the water in the aquarium could become green without proper monitoring.
When we went to solve the problem of the greening of the pool, the best chemicals were discussed.
Andrada says, "Athletes are training in the pool, so we can't use too much chemicals in water."
Of course, we should have done better at first to prevent the pool from turning green.
When the pool turned green, we made another mistake.

The forum between Shanghai and Taipei will continue despite the stagnation of cross-Strait communication mechanisms
On Friday, the Shanghai Municipal Department announced that Shanghai and Taipei would hold an annual city forum in Taipei from 22 to 23 August, despite the current stagnation of cross-Strait communication mechanisms.
The Shanghai municipality announced, through its official blog account on Sina Weibo, that Shahailin, a senior municipal official, would lead a delegation to the Forum on behalf of the Mayor of Shanghai, Yang Hung.
The Forum has been held in alternate cities since its inception in 2010.
According to the Shanghai Municipality, the 2016 forum will focus on exchanges in the areas of health care, smart cities, culture and transport, thus "deepening exchanges and cooperation between the two cities".
Since Taiwan ' s new leader, Choi, took office in May, Taiwan ' s refusal to recognize the 92nd Consensus, based on the one-China principle, has led to the suspension of cross-Straits communication and consultation mechanisms.
On Friday, the spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the mainland State Council said that cross-Strait relations could be maintained as long as Taiwan adhered to the political basis of the 92nd Consensus.
Ma Xiao Guang stressed that the nature of cross-Strait relations and urban exchanges should be interpreted correctly, saying: "We are positive and open to cross-Strait urban exchanges..."
The President of Uganda met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of China and looked forward to enhanced cooperation
The President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, in his meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, Wang Yi, on Thursday, expressed his gratitude to China for its long-standing support for the development of Uganda and his desire to enhance bilateral cooperation.
According to Museveni, China, an old friend of Uganda and Africa, fought alongside Africa in its struggle against colonialism, and later supported Africa ' s economic and social development.
The President cited the Tanzan railway built in the 1970s as proof of China ' s generous support, when China itself was not even prosperous.
Museveni stated that China had cooperated with Uganda in many ways, from infrastructure development, business investment to cultural exchange. He added that such cooperation was more conducive to Uganda ' s long-term development than simply providing assistance.
He hoped that China would be involved in infrastructure development and industrial parks in Uganda through various means.
He also welcomed more Chinese to Uganda for investment and tourism.
Wang Yi commended Uganda ' s progress in industrialization and agricultural modernization and said that China would continue to be Uganda ' s most reliable and ideal partner.
Wang Yi stated that China was ready to do its utmost to help Uganda pursue its economic and social development and stressed that cooperation between China and Uganda was sincere and free of any political conditions, since such cooperation was based on a high degree of political mutual trust and long-term friendship.
He said that China would strengthen its cooperation with Uganda in infrastructure and industrial park development and support energy and agricultural development in the East African countries.
