The Icelandic Bureau of Weather also reports that there has been no seismic activity in the Hekra area for the last 48 hours.
The major seismic event that caused the transformation of the stage took place on the north-east side of the volcano's top collapsing crater on March 10.
There are reports of black clouds at the foot of the mountain that have nothing to do with any volcanic activity.
These clouds may cause confusion as to whether there really was a volcanic eruption.
The Luno carried 120 to 160 cubic metres of fuel, and when it failed, the wind and the waves pushed it onto the seawall.
The helicopter rescued 12 crew members, only one of whom suffered a broken nose.
The 100-metre-long ship was sailing and carrying the same fertilizer cargo as before, and the officials initially feared that the ship's cargo might spill.
The proposed amendments were passed in the Senate and the Senate in 2011.
The articles were slightly amended during the Legislative Council period, with the second sentence first deleted by the House of Representatives and passed by the Senate on Monday in a similar form.
The reason why the second sentence has been deleted is to recommend banning same-sex civil unions, which may well open the door to future civil unions.

Kano, a famous but controversial English teacher who taught under the banner of modern and royal education, claimed that there were 9,000 students at the peak of his career.
In his notes, he used words that his parents thought were vulgar and said he used indecent language in the classroom.
Today's education accuses him of publishing large ads on the bus without permission and of lying that he is the chief English teacher.
He was also accused of violating copyright, but was not charged.
An old man said he was "Teaching dating skills in the classroom, like a student's friend."
In the last 30 years, China has developed a market economy, even though it is officially a communist country.
The first economic reform was led by Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economy has grown 90 times.
Last year, for the first time, China exported more cars than Germany and overtaken the United States as the biggest market for the car industry.
China’s GDP may exceed the United States in 20 years.
The tropical storm of Danielle was formed east of the Atlantic Ocean, the fourth named hurricane in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.
The storm is about 3000 miles from Miami, Florida, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 40 miles per hour (64 miles per hour).
Scientists at the United States National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will become a hurricane by Wednesday or later.
The storm is still a while away from landing, and it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek was born in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, and became famous for serving the Belgrade guerrillas.
He joined them in 1945, until 1958.
He's been on the team 468 times. 403 goals.
No one's got more time than Bob Baker for the ball and for the goal.
In 1995, he was chosen as the best player in guerrilla history.
The celebration was preceded by a special performance by the world-renowned Sun Circus.
Then came the Istanbul National Symphony, a security band, and singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.

"Lucky I didn't do anything, but I saw a terrible scene where people tried to break through the window and escape.
People hit the window with a chair, but the window was unbreakable.
The survivor Francescek Koval said, "One of them finally broke, and they started to escape through the window."
The stars are glowing and hot because when the hydrogen atoms merge and bind together to form heavier elements, they generate energy.
Scientists are working to create reactors that generate energy in the same way.
However, the problem is very difficult to solve, and it will take years to build a useful fusion reactor.
The needles float on the surface because of surface tension.
Surface tension arises from the attraction between water molecules, which is more attractive than between them and the air molecules above.
The water molecules form an invisible layer on the surface of the water so that things like the needle can float on the surface.
There are two blades in the modern skates, and there is a pit between the blades.
The edges of the blades are bent slightly, and when the blades are tilted to one side, the edges of the blades touch the ice.
If the skaters turn right, the skaters turn right, and if the skaters turn left, the skaters turn left.
To return to the original level of energy, the atom must remove the extra energy from the light.
They do it by emitting microscopic light particles called "the photon".
Scientists refer to this process as "explosive radiation" because the atom is energized by strong light, leading to the photon in the light, which is the type of radiation.
The next picture shows atoms ejecting light. Of course, in reality, the photo is much smaller than what it sees in this picture.
The photon is even smaller than the substance that makes it an atom!
After hundreds of hours, the light in the bulbs will eventually burn and the bulbs will no longer be used.
And then the light bulbs need to be changed.
First, you need to turn off the lights or cut the wires.
It's because if you touch the inside of the plug or the bottom of part of the light bulb and still contact the plug, the current into the plug (i.e. the location of the metal part of the light bulb) can cause you severe electrical shocks.
The main organ of the cycle system is the heart that pumps blood.
The blood flows from the heart into a pipe known as an artery and from a pipe called a vein to the heart.
Triangular dinosaurs can crush not only leaves, but even very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists think that the Triceratops feed on the iron, which is a common plant in white age.
These plants look like a little palm tree with a sharp puncture of leaves.
Triceratops may have taken the leaves off with their strong beaks before feeding on the trunks.
Other scientists deny that these plants are highly toxic, so that no dinosaur is likely to eat, but other animals today, such as lasagna and pelicans, can eat toxic leaves or fruit.
How will the Earth's Earth's surface pull me? If you stand on the surface of the Earth's surface, it'll weigh less than you stand on the surface of the Earth.
A man weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth, 36 pounds (16 kg) on a man.
The sun doesn't have the Earth's crust that allows you to stand on it. The whole sun is made of gas, fire and electricity.
The further away from the center of the sun, the thinner the gas.
The outer part of what we see when we look at the sun is called the light sphere.
About 3,000 years later, Italian astronomer Galileo Gally observed with a telescope in 1610 that Venus was as profitable as the moon.
Venus (or moon) is only lighted on the sun, so there's a profit and a loss.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, the British astronomer Jeremiah Horox observed Venus Day.
England went through a long period of peace after taking over Denmark again.
However, in 991, Esselred met the largest Viking fleet since the Gutlum fleet of the last century.
The fleet is led by Olaf Trigwasen, a Norwegian with ambitions to take back his country from Denmark.
After the initial military defeat, Esselred agreed to an agreement with Olaf, who then returned to Norway, where he was defeated when he tried to take his kingdom back.
It's the only specially invented letter that is widely used in everyday life. It was invented in 1444 during the reign of the Emperor (1418–1450).
The Emperor is the fourth king of the Korean dynasty and one of its most respected.
He used to call it "the right voice to guide the people."
One is that the Aryans have moved from the West to India with their own language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language comparable to the Latin used in Europe.
The oldest known books in the world are written in Sanskrit.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which is the source of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
With the end of the war with France, Germany began preparations to invade Britain.
Germany named the attack Operation Sea Lion. The British lost most of their heavy weapons and supplies when Dumblek withdrew, and the army was very weak.
But the Royal Navy is still far more powerful than the German Navy and can destroy any invading fleet crossing the English Channel.
However, since the Navy would be worried that the ships would be sunk by German air strikes, very few Royal Navy ships would be in the vicinity of the larger invasion route.
Let's start by explaining Italy's plans.
Even if they had just built four new ships before the war began, it still had a weaker army and navy.
The main objective of Italy is African countries, and in order to occupy these countries, they will need a place for their troops to leave, so that they can cross the Mediterranean Sea to invade Africa.
In addition to these actions, Italian ships are not expected to do anything else.
Now speaking of Japan, Japan is an island nation, like the United Kingdom.
The submarine is a ship that sails underwater and stays for a long time.
The submarines were used during World War I and World War II. They were very slow and with very limited range.
In the early days of the war, most of them sailed on the sea, but as the radar developed, it became more precise and the submarines were forced to sail underwater to avoid detection.
German submarines are known as U-boats.
Because of their success in submarines, Germany is not trusted to have many submarines after the war.
Yes. King Tutankhamen is sometimes called King Tut or King Boy, one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings in the modern world.
Interestingly, he wasn't valued in ancient times, and most of the ancient kings had no record of him.
However, his grave was discovered in 1922, making him a celebrity.
Most of the items buried with Tutankhamen are well preserved, including thousands of objects made of precious metals and rare stones.
The radiation wheel invents an Assyrian chariot that is lighter, faster and more prepared than soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows fired from their deadly crossbow can penetrate the enemy's armor. The Assyrians brought in their first cavalry in about 1,000 B.C.
The cavalry was an army fighting on the back of a horse, and since the saddle had not been invented at the time, the Assyrian cavalry was fighting on the back of a bare horse.
We know a lot of Greek politicians, scientists and artists, and the most famous of Greek culture should be Homer, the legendary poet of the visually impaired, who has written two major Greek literatures: the poems of Iliad and Odyssey.
Sofokles and Aristoven are still the most famous writers, and their plays are known as one of the greatest works in world literature.
Another famous Greek is a mathematician, Pythagoras, most famous for his theory of the rectangular triangle.
Indian is estimated to be the second to fourth language used by the largest number of people in the world.
The number of people whose native language is Indian varies depending on whether the very close dialects are counted.
It is estimated that between 340 million and 500 million people use language and 800 million more can understand it.
In daily conversations, users of both languages can understand each other.
In the 15th century or so, northern Estonia was deeply affected by German culture.
Some German monks, in order to bring God closer to the local people, invented the language of the Estonian language.
It's taken from the German alphabet and added a character, "Photo-Photo".
With the passage of time, many of the words borrowed from Germany have been merged.
Traditionally, the heirs to the throne will join the army directly upon completion of their studies.
But Charles chose to study anthropology and archaeology at the University of Cambridge Trinity, and then in history, where he received 2:2% of the second degree.
Charles was the first English royal member to have a bachelor's degree.
Europe and Turkey account for three percent of the country.
The Turkish territory is more than 1,600 km (1,000 miles) and 800 km wide (500 miles) and is roughly a rectangular.
Turkey’s soil includes lakes, accounting for 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) are south-west of Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 square miles) are in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world, and its size is the sum of France and Britain.
Turkey is surrounded by three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back to 1839.
Some of today's Belgian soil was part of Luxembourg in the past, but it became part of the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s.
Luxembourg has been trying to preserve its neutral role, but it was occupied by Germany during World War I and World War II.
Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization in 1957, which today is called the European Union.
Chukjiangburg is an abandoned fortress and Buddhist temple in the upper Phondey Village district.
Zabron Avon Namgair built this fortress in 1649 to commemorate his defeat of the Tibetan Mongols.
In 1951, a fire left only a portion of the remains of Jokerghamburg, one of which is the painting of Zabron Avon Namgair.
Fortress is protected and protected in the aftermath of the fire, becoming one of the most attractive sites in Bhutan.
During the 18th century, Cambodia found itself in a trap between two powerful neighboring Thailand and Vietnam.
Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
The Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia at the end of the 18th century.
Eighteen percent of the Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of the working people are engaged in informal economic activities.
Three out of three Venezuelans work in the service industry, nearly one out of four people work in factories, and one out of five people grow.
Although only one percent of the population is engaged in oil, oil is an important business in Venezuela, as it is a clean exporter of oil.
In the early days of national independence, Singapore's knowledge of botanical gardens helped the island to shake itself into a hot-band garden city.

Learning to create routine and traditional skills in interactive media, as well as tools acquired in interactive classes (panel panels, audio and video editors, storytelling, etc.)
The interactive design requires you to re-evaluate the assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
The interactive design requires that each component of the project be connected to each other, but at the same time it becomes a single entity.
In order to reach a certain focus range, the deficiency in the focus mirror is that the complexity of the focus and the number of elements in the mirror are more demanding.
It's not going to be a problem, because the camera producer has been able to produce a higher quality.
This allows the focus lens to take pictures of quality comparable to the focus.
Another flaw in the focus mirror is that its largest halo (speed) is usually lower.
It's hard to use a cheap focal lens in a low-light environment without a flashlight.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a film into a DVD format is overscanting.
Most TV shows are designed to please the public.
So, all the shows you saw on TV, the top, the bottom and the sides were cut off.
This is to make sure the image covers the entire screen.
Unfortunately, when you make DVDs, its boundaries are likely to be cut off, and if the subtitles of the film are too close to the bottom, they won't be shown in their entirety.
The traditional castles of the Middle Ages are always inspired by imagination, fighting, and the scenes of the feast and the knights of Arthur are before us.
Even standing in the ruins of a thousand years of history, the imitation still smells of war, hears the sound of horseshoes pedaling on pebbles and feels fear in the dungeons.
But our imagination is based only on reality. Why are castles created in the first place? How are they designed and built?
The classics of the time, Kirby was actually more of a firm house than a real castle.
Their large glass windows and thin walls cannot withstand the sustained attacks.
In the 1480s, the castle was built by Lord Hastings, when the country was relatively peaceful and only needed to defend itself against the rogue bandits.
The balance of power is a system in which European countries seek to preserve the sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea is that in all European countries there must be a way to prevent one of them from becoming stronger, so governments often switch allies to maintain balance.
The Spanish throne was crowned with the first war of power balance.
This is a major change, because Europe's powers can no longer use religion as an excuse for war. Thirty years of war has been called the last religious war.
At the Atemis temple of Ephesus, destroyed on the 20th of July, 356 B.C., Herostadts admitted that he set fire to him.
According to his words, his motive was to get a reputation even if he tried anything.
Fortunately, the Greek historian Strapo wrote his name, which is why we only learned it today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander was born.
Alexander, the Great, offered to pay for the reconstruction of the temple, which was later rebuilt in 323 B.C. after Alexander died.
Make sure your hand relaxes as much as possible, and at the same time hit all notes correctly -- and try not to move your fingers too much.
Just remember that you don't have to hit the keys like a piano to increase the volume.
To increase the volume of the accordion, you can put more pressure or speed in the trunk.
Mystics pursue the ultimate truth, the divine, the spiritual truth or the communication with God, and seek the form of recognition and self-consciousness.
Those who believe in it seek direct experience, intuition or insight in the divine reality/god.
Followers pursue certain ways of life or practices designed to foster them.
Mysticism, unlike other forms of religious belief and worship, highlights the direct personal experience of a unique mind, especially those who have peace, insight, happiness, or even ecstasy.
The Sikh religion is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region of the 15th century, divided from Hindu sects.
The Sikhs think their faith is a religion separate from Hinduism, even if they recognize its roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, the "Gulu Road" in Punjab.
The religion was founded in the fifteenth century by Grunaco (1469 to 1539), and was inherited by nine of them.
However, in June 1956, Khrushchev's promise was tested when there was a riot in Poland and local workers turned from a protest against food shortages and salary cuts to a protest against Communism as a whole.
Although Khrushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order, he made concessions on some of the economic requirements and agreed to appoint the popular Wadislaw Gomurka as the new Prime Minister.
The Indus Valley civilization is a bronze-era civilization in the north-west of the Indian subcontinent, covering most of the modern Pakistan and some parts of north-west India and north-east Afghanistan.
The civilization flourished in the Indian river basin and came to that name.
Although some scholars assume that this civilization also exists in the now dried-up Salaswati river basin, it should be known as the Insa bi-civilization, while others named it Halapa (the first place of the earth in the 1920s) and called it the Harapa civilization.
The militarism of the Roman Empire is inherently helping medical progress.
Augustus began recruiting doctors and even set up the first Roman medical team to deal with the injuries caused by the war.
Surgeons have knowledge of sedatives, such as morphine in seed extracts and dung in seed seeds.
They're proficient in amputations, saving patients from gangrene, and using tourniquets and arteries to stop blood flow.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has brought huge gains in the field of medicine and has shaped much of what we know today.
Pure paper is a rule that can only be used once in a pile of paper fluids, which is more complicated than the use of internal flipping methods, and each stack has an easily understandable stacking position.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people with less or limited mobility.
At a very young age, children have developed racial and racial stereotypes that affect their behaviour.
For example, when children learn that their minority ethnic group is most poorly portrayed in school, their performance in school tends to be worse.
MySpace is the third most popular site in the United States, with 54 million subscribers.
These sites have attracted much attention, especially in terms of education.
These sites have many positive implications, including the ease with which school pages can be created, which can include blogs, videos, photographs and other functions.
It's easy to visit pages with one URL, and it's easier to remember and enter for students who are not good at keyboarding and spelling.
It can be customized, make it easier to read, and it can add or reduce colours as needed.
"Deficiency" is a neurosystemic syndrome with three typical diagnostic symptoms of impulsiveness, distraction, and excess of energy."
It's not a learning barrier; it's a learning loss; it's an "influence of three to five percent of children, that's probably two million more American children."
Children with insufficient attention are unable to concentrate on certain things, such as schoolwork, but they can concentrate on things that they love, such as playing games, watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without labels.
These kids are always in trouble because they're irritating the brain through "dangerous behavior, fighting and challenging authority," because they can't get irritated in a normal way.
Attention deficiency affects relationships with other peers, because other children cannot understand why patients behave and cause problems or why they have different levels of maturity.
The ability to learn and learn changes in the way mentioned above, and the efficiency of acquiring knowledge changes.
The way information is obtained is no longer the same. Pressure does not exist in personal memory, and the focus becomes the ability to remember words.
Renaissance has changed the way in which learning and knowledge are spread.
The primitives are different from other primate animals, who no longer move their hands, carry weight or shake between trees.
The hands and feet of chimpanzees are similar in size and length, reflecting the heavy use of the hand in the direction of walking.
Man's hands are smaller than his feet, and his fingers are sharper.
Two million to three million years ago, the fossils revealed a shift in the hand from being used exclusively for movement to being used exclusively for operation.
Some believe that it is very exhausting to experience the sober dreams of these people.
The main reason for this is that sober dreams extend the time between rapid eye sleep.
The less time you sleep fast at night, the less time you get real sleep and physical recovery, the less problems you get.
It's like waking up on TV every 20 or 30 minutes.
These influences depend on the frequency of your brain trying to wake up every night.
Almost from the very beginning, the situation of Italians in North Africa was not so good. In the week following Italy's declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the 11th Light Rider of England had taken Capuzburg in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Latucci, the 10th Italian general engineer.

This sport is conducted in a two-person mode, with a swordfighter against another swordfighter.
Golf is a game where golfers use golf clubs to hit the ball in a hole.
There are 18 holes in the standard round, and the players usually start at the first hole in the field and end at the end of the 18 hole.
The player who finishes all the holes in the field with a minimum number of poles or swings wins.
The movement takes place on the grass, and the grass around the hole is cut short and called fruit.
The most common form of travel may be the knowledge of a large part of the population about travel: leisure travel.
People go to places that are very different from their daily lives to relax and enjoy.
The beach, the theme park and the camping grounds are the most frequent places for tourists.
If a person visits a place to understand its history and culture, this kind of travel is called cultural travel.
Travellers can visit different landmarks in a country, or choose to visit one of the regions on a priority basis.
The colonists saw these events and called for reinforcements.
The reinforcement of the front-line deployment of the army, including Colonel John Stark and Colonel James Reed, the New Hampshire First and Third Corps, with a total of 200 soldiers.
Stark's soldiers took the north end of the colonial camp along the fence.
When the tide retreats and opens a gap along the mysterious river in the north-east of the island, they quickly extend the fences of a small stone wall, and then stretch north to the water on the beach.
Greeley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet in front of the fence and ordered that no one be allowed to fire until the regulars passed.
The U.S. plans to launch a coordinated attack in three different directions.
General John Kadwald hit the British garrison in Bourdon to the west to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing led 700 militiamen across the river at Trenton docks, took over the bridge on Assembling Creek and prevented any enemy from escaping.
The 2400 major raids will cross the 9-mile river north of Trenton, and will be divided into two groups, one following Green and the other following Sullivan in order to launch the pre-dawn offensive.
When you turn from a quarter to a half mile, the speed is less important and the endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
A first-rate half-mile runner who can hit the line in two minutes must maintain a high speed, but at the same time have the patience to respond to all crises.
Some cross-country run in the winter, combining the upper half of the gym, is the best preparation for the run-off season.
Absorption by right nutrition alone does not produce good performance, but it effectively improves the overall health of young athletes.
Keeping a healthy energy balance, developing effective water recharge habits and understanding the various aspects of training can help athletes improve their performance and make sport more enjoyable.
Midway running is a relatively cheap sport; however, there are still a lot of misunderstandings about participating in the number of facilities needed.
You can buy products as you want, but most of the time it has only a slight, if any, impact on performance.
Activists may prefer a product, even if it does not bring any practical benefit.
Atoms are seen as one of the building blocks of all matter.
According to the simplified Bol model, it is a very complex entity, with a central core surrounded by electrons, similar to planets orbiting around the sun.
The atomic core consists of two particles -- neutron and proton.
Proton with a positive charge, neutron with no charge, electrons with a negative charge.
Before checking the wounded, you must examine the environment to make sure you're safe.
You need to be careful with their positions and any dangerous alarms when you get in touch with the wounded.
If you get hurt when you try to help, you may only make things worse.
Research shows the relationship between depression, fear and disaster can interfere with the pain and disability of a person suffering from back pain.
Only the effects of disaster degradation vary according to the regular system of physical activity per week, and depression and fear do not.
Those who regularly participate need more support in the negative perception of pain, so that they can distinguish between chronic pain and the inappropriateness of normal physical action.
The ability to see or to see depends on the sense organs or eyes of the visual system.
The eyes have many different structures, depending on the needs of the creature.
Different structures have different functions, different sensory wavelengths, different sensitivity, and they require different processing processes to understand the images entered and different numbers to achieve the best performance.
Population or total amount is a group of specific species within a given geographical range.
It's called monolithic when one of the forms in a group is identical.
It's a multiplicity of variations when the individual displays a particular characteristic.
The ants move and nest at different stages.
In the nomadic sector, ants move at night, and the day stops to camp.
When the food available is reduced, the herds begin the nomadic phase.
Every time there is a pastoral or migration that lasts for about 17 days.
The word cell is from Latin "cella", which means "small room," originally proposed by microscopic scientists through the structure of the cork.
Cells are the basic unit of all organisms, and all organisms are made of one or more cells.
Cells are the foundation and the key to the study of life, which, in fact, are often referred to as "the bedrock of life".
The nervous system maintains the internal balance by developing a nervous impulse in the body, which keeps the blood flowing undisrupted.
These nervous impulses can spread rapidly throughout the body, helping to protect the body from any potential threat.
Compared to other violent storms, the tornadoes have smaller dimensions, but they can destroy everything in their path.
The tornado pulls the tree roots, rips out the panels on the building and rolls the car into the sky. 2% of the strong tornadoes last for more than three hours.
These megastorms have a wind speed of 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles/h).
For thousands of years, humans have been producing and using mirrors for magnifying purposes.
But the first real telescope was made in Europe in the 16th century.
These telescopes combine the two mirrors, making the remote objects look bigger and closer.
Greed and selfishness can never leave us, and when most people benefit from cooperation, selfishness can bring more short-term benefits to others, which is one of the essences of cooperation.
I hope a lot of people will realize that working with each other is a good way to stay far away.
Many dream of the day when humans can travel to other planets and explore other worlds, some wonder what's out there, some believe that aliens or other lives exist on another planet.
But if it's true, it won't last long.
Maybe one day your great-grandson will think about their ancestors in the alien world?
Animals are made up of large numbers of cells, they eat and digest in their bodies, most animals move.
Only animals have brains.
The earth is full of animals, some digging holes in the ground, some swimming in the sea, some flying through the sky.
Cells are the most basic components and functional units of life.
The word "cell" comes from the Latin word "cella" and means a small room.
If you look at organisms under microscopes, you'll find that they are made of tiny squares or spheres.
The English biologist Robert Hook observed a tiny block of wood under a microscope.
They look like a room.
Elements and compounds can be converted from one state to another and remain unchanged.
Nitrogen, though gas, still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen, and the density of liquid is higher, but the molecules are the same.
Water is another example of a compound made of two hydrogen and one oxygen atom.
No matter how much gas, liquid or solid, molecules are the same.
Although their physical state may change, chemical state may not.
Time has always been around us, affecting everything we've done, but it's hard to understand.
Religion, philosophy and science have studied time for thousands of years.
We feel the passage of time through a series of events in the future, now in the past.
Time is the way we compare activity with activity.
You can self-record the passage of time by observing the repetition of a periodical event, which is what happens regularly.
Today's computer is used to process images and videos.
Computers can make complicated animations, which are becoming more common in television and movies.
Music is usually recorded by sophisticated computers that process and mix sound.
For a long time from the nineteenth to the twentieth centuries, it was widely believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Māori, who lived on giant birds who hunted a bird.
This theory has also established the concept that Māori left Polinisia in a large fleet, took New Zealand from the Morioli and developed a farming society.
But there's new evidence that the Moriolis are actually a group of Maori who moved from New Zealand to the main island of Chatham and then developed their own unique culture of peace.
There's another tribe on the Chatham Islands, the Māori from New Zealand.
They call themselves the Moriolis. After a little conflict, the Moriolis were destroyed.
Those who have participated in the last decade have helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions, and at the same time to judge our difficulties frankly and even to fail.
After listening to you share your stories about your own family and institutions, we have been able to learn more about the past and about people who have had a positive or negative impact on institutional culture.
Understanding its history does not mean understanding its culture, but at least it helps people understand their place in the history of the organization.
When evaluating success and realizing failure, individuals and participants as a whole will explore the deeper value, mission and motivation of the institution.
In this context, looking back at the past examples of entrepreneurial behaviour and leading to its success helps people to accept new changes in the local church and to move in a new direction.
The success stories should reduce people's fear of change, while at the same time making people more willing to accept the changes that will take place.
A conglomerate model of thinking is a solution to bring together different ideas and paradigms to find solutions.
The point of such thinking is speed, logic and precision, as well as awareness, reapply existing techniques and collect data.
The most important element of this thinking is that there's only one right answer, and you only come up with two answers, right or wrong.
This way of thinking is linked to certain scientific or standard procedures.
People who think like that have the logic to remember the pattern, solve problems and conduct scientific tests.
Human beings are the kind of people who can understand other kinds of ideas most today.
It means that we can successfully predict other people's perceptions, intentions, beliefs, awareness or desire.
It's particularly important to know what others are trying to do in these abilities, and it allows us to better understand the differences that arise from the movement of the members.
For example, if you saw someone break the window, you'd have a good chance of trying to steal someone's car.
If he loses his key and tries to break the window, he needs a different judgment.
Magnetic resonance is based on a physical phenomenon called NMR, which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell.
In this resonance, the magnetic field and the radio waves give the atom a weak radio signal.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a doctor and scientific researcher, discovered the foundation for using magnetic resonance images as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, it received a patent, the first global patent on the magnetic resonance field.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the first "Magnetic Resonance Scanner" he called it.
Non-synchronous communication provides time to reflect and respond to others.

Students can ask their teachers questions at any time of the day, and they are expected to respond soon, without having to wait until the next class.
Post-modernism learning offers absolute freedom.
In fact, there is no one good thing to learn.
All the learning TV shows that we're now getting on our own, and that's exactly what we need to know.
A lot of people will find themselves watching a TV show that shows the process and experience of knowledge that we will never be involved in or used.
We'll never renovate cars, build fountains in the backyard, visit ancient sites in Peru or renovate neighbor's houses.
The Internet is well connected in Greenland, and 93% of the population is connected to the Internet.
Your hotel or owner (if staying in a hotel or a private residence) may have a wifi or a computer connected to the Internet, and all settlements have a net or a public wifi.
As mentioned above, while the term "Eskimo" is still acceptable in the United States, many non-American Arctics (especially Canadians) consider it to be incorruptible.
Although you might hear the word used by Greenlanders, foreigners should avoid using it.
Natives of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq in Greenland.
In Greenland, there's almost no crime and no hostility to foreigners, even in towns and cities, there's no "Zakiland."
The cold weather is probably the only real danger for those who are not prepared to meet.
If you visit Greenland in the cold season, you have to have enough warm clothes.

KV62 is probably the most famous mausoleum in King's Valley, discovered by Howard Carter in 1922, the almost perfect royal mausoleum of young kings.
However, compared to most other royal mausoleums, the Tutankamen mausoleum is less worthy of observation because it is small and not much decorative.
Anyone interested in the harm done to the mummies when they come out of the earth will be disappointed, because only the head and the shoulders can be seen.
A huge amount of accompaniment in the mausoleum is no longer in existence and is being transferred to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
It's better for tourists to look elsewhere for a little bit of time.

This will ensure that your particular interests and/or limitations match their best-suited ships.
Before the arrival of the 16th century Spaniards, the northern part of Chile was ruled by Inca, while the indigenous Araucani (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent indigenous tribes in the United States, and it was not until Chile became independent that it was completely ruled in Spanish.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the years of the Napoleonic War, Spain lost a functioning central government), it did not win a decisive victory over Spain until 1818.

Travel costs are high and require health and can only take place in the summer between November and February and are limited mainly to the half-islands, the islands and the Rose Sea.
In the summer, thousands of workers lived here, about 50 in these areas; very few stayed for the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a desolate highland covered by 2 to 3 km of ice.
Occasionally, there are dedicated air travel groups to the interior, to the mountains or to the South Pole, where there are large bases.
The Southern Pole is a 1,600-km route linking the McMurdo base and the southern pole in the Rose Sea.
There's snow on the road and it's filled with cracks, and it's marked by a flag.
They're not very lively, so the route has to turn a big turn around the mountains of the South Pole to reach the plateau.
The most common accidents in winter occur on wet roads, pedestrian roads and (especially) steps.
At least, you need shoes with the right bottoms, and summer shoes are usually slippery on ice, and even winter boots aren't enough.
Pyramids are at least 5 mm (1/5 inches) deep and the material needs to be soft enough in cold weather.
Some boots have nails, and some additional gadgets full of nails to deal with slides, for most shoes and boots, for heels or heels and soles of shoes.
The heel should be low and wide.
Avalanche is not an aberration; steep slopes can only bear a certain amount of snow, and the remaining amount of snow will fall in the form of an avalanche.

Sometimes the initial trigger is warm snow, sometimes snowfalls increase, sometimes other natural events, but usually man-made.
The tornado is an extremely low-pressure rotor that inhales air from all around and up.

The actual text translation application is an application that automatically translates the entire text paragraph from one language to another.
Some applications of this model can even translate foreign language text on smart phones when users point them to symbols or other objects in the real world.
The translation engines have been significantly improved, and in most cases they now provide more or less correct translations (less can be done in a language that does not make sense), but they still have to be careful, and they may be wrong about everything.
Among these applications, one of the most prominent is Google Translation, which allows offline translation after downloading the required language data.
When you leave your country, the use of GPS navigational applications on your smart phone may be the easiest and convenient way to navigate.
It's cheaper than buying a new GPS map, or a stand-alone GPS device, or renting a car rental company.
If the cell phone is not connected to the data, or is out of reach, the function may be restricted or unavailable.
Every store on the corner has a row of fancy prepaid cards that can be used to pay for a phone or a regular phone.
Although most of the cards can be accessed anywhere, some of the cards are specifically designed to provide preferential calls for particular groups of countries.
When using these services, you usually have to call a non-charged phone number from most phone calls.
The rules for general photography are also appropriate for filming, and there may be more.
If there's something you don't take pictures of, you don't want to be able to film.
If you want to use drones, check if the place can be filmed in advance and if you need permission or extra license.
It's a bad idea to use drones near an airport or above a crowd, even if it's not illegal in the area.
Only very few people now book their tickets directly through the airline without first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the prices of the same flight may vary considerably from one website to another, and it is worth comparing the search results and viewing the airline ' s own website before ordering it.
You may not need a visa for short-term visitors to some countries, but it usually takes longer to travel as an international student than a regular tourist.
Normally, a long stay in any foreign country requires an advance visa.
Student visas usually have different requirements and application procedures than regular travel or business visas.
For most countries, you'll need a letter of notice from your institution of study and a certificate of the money that will be used to pay for your life at least in the first year of the course.
In this post, I would like to ask you about the details of your request for study in schools in countries where you wish to study and the immigration department.
Unless you're a diplomat, working abroad usually means you have to claim tax revenues in your country.
The tax structure varies from country to country, and the rates and levels of taxation vary considerably.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, tax revenues are collected at the same time at the federal and local levels, and therefore tax rates and rates may vary from region to region.
You usually go home without an entry check, or just a routine, but customs control can be a problem.
You need to verify the carrying and prohibited items, and report everything beyond the statutory limits.
The simplest way to invest in travelling writing is to sharpen skills on well-known travel blog sites.
Once you're familiar with the format and editing on the Internet, you can then create your own website.
Voluntary work on a journey is a good way to do good, but it's not just to pay.
Living abroad and volunteering is a good way to learn about other cultures, to learn new friends, to know yourself, to hear more and even to acquire new skills.
This is also a way to reduce spending and increase stay time, as many volunteer jobs provide accommodation and food, and some may earn a small salary.
The Vikings reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea via Russian waterways, some of which are still navigable.
The White Sea-Polo seaway, mainly via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and the rivers and lakes of St. Petersburg, connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea.
Lake Onega is also connected to the River Ceiba and can therefore be reached from the Caspian Sea via Russia.
Don't worry, if you get to the pier, everything will be clearer.
Basically, you can post an announcement to show that you can help, walk around the docks, get close to the man who cleans the yacht, try to get in touch with the sailors at the bar, etc.
Try talking to as many people as you can, and in a while, everyone will know you and will tell you which ship you're looking for.
You should be careful with flying frequent airlines from the air leagues.
While your instincts suggest that you should join the largest number of flights, you should note that they often offer different advantages, and that the constants' scores may be more generous in different airlines in the same coalition.
Airlines such as Emirates Airlines, Attihad Airlines, Qatar Airlines and Turkish Airlines have greatly expanded services in Africa and provided routes to many major cities in Africa at more competitive prices than other European airlines.
As of 2014, Turkish Airlines has been able to fly to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra travel time, you can compare your total fare to the global ticket price in Africa.
Don't forget to account for extra visas, exit taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all locations outside Africa.
If you want to fly across the southern hemisphere, the choice of flight and destination will be limited by the lack of cross-sea routes.
There are no airline alliances with roads that span three seas across the southern hemisphere.
But the Federation of Stars and Spaces has all the flights, except for the South Pacific East from Santiago, Chile, to Tahiti, which belongs to the LATAM family.
If you want to skip the West Bank in the South Pacific and South America, this flight is not your only option.
In 1994, the Armenian ethnic region of Azerbaijan, Nagorny Karabakh, started a war against the Azerbaijanis.
With the support of Armenia, a new republic was born, yet no established country officially recognized it, not even Armenia.
The diplomatic debate in the region continues to undermine relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canonian region (Netherlands: Grachtengerel) is a well-known area near Amsterdam in the 17th century.
Because of its unique cultural and historical values, the entire region is classified by UNESCO as the world ' s heritage, with the highest value of its property in the country.
Cinque Terre means "five pieces of land", made up of five small coastal villages in Liguria, Italy, Riomagiore, Manalola, Cornilla, Vernaza and Monteroso.
The five villages were listed in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
For centuries, people have carefully built ladders on the rugged terrain, stretching over the cliffs of the sea.
One of its charms is that there is no obvious business involved in development. Roads, trains and boats connect villages, and cars cannot enter from the outside.
The French of Belgium and Switzerland are slightly different from the French of France, but they are very similar and can understand each other.
More specifically, the Belgian and Swiss French digital systems have a little speciality, unlike French, and some words have a slightly different pronunciation.
In spite of this, all Belgians and Swiss using French have studied standard French at school, so they can understand the standard French digital system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a gesture of friendship, representing "Hello."
However, in Malaysia, at least among the Malays in the rural areas, it means "come here", like some Western countries using crooked food fingers to their bodies, and it should be used only for that purpose.
Similarly, English tourists in Spain might have mistakenly thought that when they waved goodbye, their hands said "back" to those who waved (rather than to those who waved).
An aid language is a language that is artificial or fabricated to facilitate communication between people who are in need of communication.
Unlike social language, it is a natural or organic language, and for one reason or another it becomes the main means of communication between users of different languages.
During the hottest day, passengers can experience a mirage that creates water (or something) hallucinations.
Passengers' quest for the mirage is dangerous, and it will waste precious strength and the rest of the water.
Even the hottest deserts get very cold at night.
Especially in the summer, if you decide to walk through the rainforest, you need to be more careful with mosquitoes.
Even if you just drove past the rain forest in the hot zone, it would be enough to get mosquitoes into the car for a few seconds.
Avian flu (more formally known as bird flu) can affect birds and mammals.
Humans are reported to have less than 1,000 cases of avian influenza, but there are already fatal cases.
Most patients are concerned with people who work with poultry, but they also pose some risks to bird-watchers.
The typical feature of Norway is that steep canals and valleys suddenly appear in almost flat highlands.
These highlands are commonly called "vidde", which means a wide open, treeless and invincible space.
In Rogaland and Agdel counties, they are commonly called "hei", a treeless marsh that is usually covered by rock south.
The glaciers are not stable, but they flow from the mountains, and this will lead to cracks, which may be covered up by the bridge.
The walls and roofs of the ice hole will collapse and the cracks may close.
On the edge of the glacier, huge pieces of ice are broken and fall, and may jump from the edge or roll further away.
Indian summer is usually the season of these mountain-riding stations.
However, they have different beautys and charms in winter, and many mountain-mounting stations have accumulated large amounts of snow, suitable for activities such as skiing and skiboarding.
Only a few airlines still provide tickets for the funeral, which makes it cheaper to travel on short notice.
The airlines that provide such tickets include Canadian Airlines, Daman Airlines, Hansa Air from the United States or Canada, and Air Weste.
In any case, you have to call the airline directly to book the tickets.
