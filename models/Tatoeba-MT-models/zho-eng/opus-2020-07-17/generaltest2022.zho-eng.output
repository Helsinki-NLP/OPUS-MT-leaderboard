Is there any way to punish him?
In case something like this ever happens again.
Or how long before the restaurant is ready? Can you ask me something?
At the grand academic year, students sing the lead.
Use air to wash hands, breathe to judge disease, and search for the sources of fog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the annual academic conference of 2016 at Zhejiang University, a series of brain-brained academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these results were students, who covered the environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities, etc. The students began with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions of applied value, some of which have won awards at the national and international levels.
Biosensors: Your home examiner.
The Ph.D. Dr. Zhang Di Ming team at the College of Biomedical Engineering showed a biosensor on the end of a smartphone, half the size of a smartphone.
"All you have to do is take a little breath, and this device will be able to test your health first from the gas composition you have ejected... "
According to Zhang Di Ming, the sensors are connected to smartphones and when the gas comes out, the health report will be on the phone.
Smart handrings that can detect health conditions in the market, usually measured by physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
And this biosensor uses this new material, graphite, which is aimed at chemical elements, with a sharp "sweetness" that allows it to be deeper and accurately representative of the state of physical health.
Smart Surgery Lamps: Doctor's high-powered eyes
In addition to smartphones, there are smart surgery lights in the operating room.
The invention won a silver prize this year at the 44th International Inventories Fair in Geneva, Switzerland.
Julinging was a Master of Pyrotechnics and Engineering, and the Shin Jun Fei team opened up new ideas in the defects of the traditional operating lights and invented intelligent LED surgery without a shadow.
"A lot of early detection of diseases, incompetence to remove, is related to the light used by the doctor ' s operating room..."
Shin Jun Fei said, for example, that if doctors fail to see all the tumor tissues in time for early cancer screening, the cancer cells will spread.
This smart operating lamp has four lamps, which, by regulating the spectrum, enhances the difference between the different tissues in light.
During the operation, the doctor adjusts the size, lightness, spectrometry, homogeneity of colour and invisibility at any time, depending on the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This smart surgery lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University Medical School, the Zhejiang University Medical School, the Children ' s Hospital, etc., and has received better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: saving water and coolness
The average man washes his hands with water, rubs up some soap, squeezes some handwashing fluid, and students like Li Qingzhang have invented an air washer.
With the handwasher on the stand, we can compress the air.
"It's like a gas pump.
The compressed air creates fluids at the taps and combines water.
So we can clean our hands! "
The color-reactive and bacterial residue experiments have shown that hand-washing by this method is the same as the normal hand-washing method.
This device will only need to be driven by our own gravity, which will ensure cleanliness and save 90% of the water, with the process completely energy-free and energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Summit of Major Challenges, the invention was the only gold prize awarded to many of the world ' s leading schools.
Please arrange to be restored to me as soon as possible, thx.
Please cancel the order and return the cash, no points, no more #PRS_ORG#!
Bones and kimchi aren't for kids.
If so, please hurry to order.
Not yet, thank you.
He asked me to tell you where he is.
I'm not waiting. Cancel the order.
I #PRS_ORG# bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can you change it?
Or cancel an order.
Yes, please.
A certificate that makes sense. A first aid certificate.
This is one of the skills I think is important in addition to my driver's license!
Circumcision: First aid is actually emergency rescue in case of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there's actually been a while since the accident when the ambulance arrived, and that's when it's all that matters.
It's time for first aid.
If I do have a heart attack, a brain hemorrhage, a breath stop, then the window of our lives is only four minutes, gold four minutes!
So the people around you know how important first aid is!
It's horrible to feel helpless when we're surrounded by people who fall, who can save him with their professional knowledge and not stand there and do nothing.
"In China, our official figures are that three million people die every year by accident, the most dangerous being a heart attack.
It's an average of 15% across the United States.
At the Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, 70% can be rescued, Shanghai, Beijing less than 1%. "
That's what first responder Luo Lok said.
If a man has a heart attack, he's not breathing, he's not beating, you can't strangle him.
You have to breathe artificially, and you have to press your chest so you can get someone back.
I find that few of us still have that awareness to learn first aid, but when it happens, it's too late, so let's call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can react in time when we're in a state of emergency.
It might save a man's life!
First aid cards can be signed up at your local Red Cross training centre. I'm registered at the Red Cross training centre in Joohai. Students have a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of what you're about to accomplish before the age of 25, and adding a first aid card to the target list was a few months ago, but it was done.
Then I'm going to take another test, and I'm going to take a dive certificate, and I saw a dive certificate in Red Book, and I think I'm gonna need a first aid card to get it, so it's still useful!

Of which 13 bucks of shrimp dumplings is just one!
Never tried.
Why don't you write it?
One for 13 bucks?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed out on the food, just one shrimp dumpling for me this time!
Because when I entered the code, it worked.
Let me conclude by saying that I personally believe that the "Four Seas" is an all-round piece of crap, in all senses.
But you're gonna say it's not as bright as it gets, and it's not as good as a match.
There's a lot of bad movies that allow you to sleep in a movie theater, and one that makes you look angry, and the "Four Seas" is like a monkey on a frown mountain, and it can light your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, HAN Hsien really has a great talent.
What's most painful about this film is that it's as if it's made in a octopus novel.
Even after reading it, you'll wonder if there's an implicit metaphor in it, but when you think about it, it's actually a piece of shit.
Let's just say something that I can't understand.
The man should be living on a small island south of the country, along with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a gentleman in the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a minivan.
The old man was watching snow from the south to the northeast in a van?
He and his father are very relieved.
And then this old man is gone.
How did she get a license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why would the small crew of the island's biker party be able to block a mountain road so easily?
And then the truck with the wires in the middle of the road was parked by the side of the road and couldn't even find the truck driver.
It's too obvious.
Why would a punk biker with a letter that doesn't work and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary cop?
Why don't you call the police in front of the loan shark and the cops ask if it's a problem?
A grown man who knows how to use a smart phone but doesn't know how to open a house card in a hotel and then makes arrangements to find a hotel owner and sleep outside the room for a night?
This inexplicable plot is all over the film, and I feel pain when I remember it because it's so out of proportion.
Besides the plot, what's worse is the subject of the film, or the fact that the film has no subject, it's an abominable suture.
At the beginning of the film, you'll think he wants to make a comedy, and in over 20 minutes you'll guess it's probably an inspirational movie, and you'll think it's probably a drama movie about how young people live in a small town, and then you'll never know what you're seeing, and then you'll have deep doubts about yourself, why you're going to the movies to see shit.
For most people, it's also very familiar with all kinds of movies, like if you're gonna shoot a motorcycle player, then you're gonna be inspired to comedy and tell the audience how a gifted rookie moves forward to success.
If you want to make love movies, you can be honest with the young people and waitress girls in the town who like to ride motorcycles.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least you can't show up against the normal world.
You can't open a hole in Kennedy's brain that won't even be able to see it.
I don't know if it's acting or what the director wants.
One more thing I don't understand, why is HAN Xin so keen to add car crashes to his own movie as a racer?
Is this the kind of film that's set up for the Spring Festival to get the audience?

Inspection of the cement module production and processing equipment.
Zhengzhou is the manufacturer of the interior concrete inspection rigs, the block-checking machine, and the wall-wall module mechanics, from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through many years of practice and development, the quality is too high, mainly in the production of hydraulic, mobile, fully automated well-checking series equipment and accessories.
Inspection of the concrete-in-well module production and processing equipment.
(b) Characteristics and advantages of the equipment of the block brick module in Zhengzhou:
I'll be happy to check new construction materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
For example: drainage, various types of inspection wells at water storage facilities, rainwater vents, trenches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge-wing walls, etc.
The advantage of building inspection wells using concrete modules is that the structures around the upper and lower edges of the modules are condensed with a combination of chain-building chains.
The walls of the well are much more resistant to the construction of a flat friction structure.
The module consists of a medium-space structure with vertical perforated perforation, horizontal perforated perforation, and a perforated perforated permeable structure with a present concrete mesh, with secondary recharge and waterproofing.
The modules have their length and lengths in a slot, horizontally in a bed, and vertically intruded together in a way that increases the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, inspection wells constructed using concrete inspection wells are not easily collapsing, sinking, leaking etc., mechanically stable, simple to operate and sized.
Concrete check well module brick device smart control data input, output device tactile liquid crystal displays the entire process of monitoring machine operations, ideal human machine dialogue, autoanalysing of the match, density operation, security logic control and failure diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulics system of the well wall module uses single-cylinder hydraulics, transports, double-cylinder hydraulics, transports.
Independent hydraulic integration stations avoid the effects of host vibrations on hydraulic systems, thereby ensuring the reliability of hydraulic systems.
Concrete inspection of modular brick-cracker material compartments has increased de-modelling, storage doors closed, automatic transmission pallets all independently of hydraulic systems, thus reducing mechanical wear and tear and maintenance.
Concrete check well module brick machine equipment using imported computers, electrical appliances, seals, hydraulics, and guaranteed equipment integrated to be stable and reliable.
The mechanical stimuli platform of the well wall module uses a whole plate steel, and the surface line is cut with no welding points, leading the filling boxes to move freely and to reduce fully the mechanical wear and tear.
Reduction of modular loads, fillings and double-encrypted amplitudes, integration, full synchronization, vibrations, simulations to ensure a positive effect.
The wall wall module is mechanically boosted and computer auto-control amplifiers are adjusted to the price ratio of the raw material without wear and tear, thereby extending the useful life and reducing costs.
Auto-control and manual control of the well wall module.
Examination of well molds:
(a) A cement-based matrix for the inspection of wells by a brick machine:
Ie-Hin's workshop is one corner:
Inspection of the production and processing equipment for the concrete module in the well
The JUNG Well Wall Brick Module equipment, in addition to the production of slabs, can produce various tiles, empty-heart bricks, street bricks.

Chongqing Secondary School is piloting modern apprenticeships, and enrolment is a business associate - Xinhuanet.
Yesterday, journalists learned from the City Council that starting this year, our city will pilot a modern apprenticeship training model in 60 secondary schools, that students who have been trained on a pilot basis will also have apprenticeship status and that enrolment will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprise.
The Municipal Council requires that the procedures for admission to secondary schools and for employment in enterprises be regulated, that the dual status of students and associate employees of the apprenticeships be clarified, that there be a tripartite agreement between the apprentices, the apprentices, the school and the enterprise on the basis of the principle of two-way selection, and that the apprentices who have not reached the age of 18 be provided with an agreement between the apprentices, the guardian, the school and the enterprise's four-party agreement to determine the rights and interests of the parties and the specific positions in which the apprentices are employed, the content of the instruction, the protection of rights and interests, etc.
The pilot schools are encouraged to use modern apprenticeships as a form of joint enterprise training and retraining of employees in enterprises.
The pilot school needs to reform the talent development model.
Schools jointly design talent development programmes, develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, entrepreneurship standards, quality control standards and implement programmes accordingly.
The pilot is based on the development of the academic system as a pilot cycle, and the duration of the student ' s internship in the enterprise is determined in accordance with the professional talent development programme, which normally lasts six months.
In business practice, an enterprise class management model should be implemented, whereby one teacher, depending on the characteristics of the different professions, may bring two to five apprentices to form study groups to ensure that students are skilled in the skills required for each rotating job.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 until August 2019, we identified 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeships in three batches, each numbering around 50, for a total of about 3,000 students (apprenticeships).
In accordance with the principle of piloting and then moving forward from point to point, explore the establishment of joint school enrolment, joint development, integrated parenting mechanisms, effective upgrading of skills in student posts and improvement of the employment rate and quality of employment among students.

The China Children's Center will host a series of events to get children to "high technology" over "6 1" - Xinhuanet.
Xinhua Society Beijing 20 May (Hang Xiaoxi Chow San) journalist learned from the Chinese Children's Centre that from 28 May until June, the "Six One" Children's Day, the China Children's Centre plans to host a series of events, such as children's creative experiences, children's visual arts festivals, and parents' "Six One" in front of technology.
It is known that the activities of the Chinese Children's Centre during the "6-1" Children's Day this year include "Friends in Cool" children's future studies in carnivals, the first children's visual arts festival, the "Handbooks for the Year" event, the "Friends for the Reading" series, etc.
The Deputy Director-General of the China Children's Centre, Li Chung-ming, presented at the 20th "6th" Children's Day Media Conference that the "Friends of Love" children's future learning carnival was the focus of this year's Chinese Children's Centre's "6-" event.
The activities are aimed at integrating social innovation into the family ' s individual creativity and at making innovative practices the cultural genes of the general family and "do do it" the new learning and way of life of the family as a whole through the participation of children and families in various innovative educational activities.
According to the information received, the Favorite Cooler children's future years of study include the Fountain Generose experience, the Year of the Cow Children's Explorer and the "Exploration of Family Love" event, the VR Universal Experience programme, and dozens of cutting-edge science and technology experiences such as the Creative Tribe interactive workshop.

Doctor of South Africa: Omicron is powerful, but mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new coronary virus has a milder pathologies than Delta mutagenics, although the spread is faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omician mutinies in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Haudun Province in South Africa reported that the symptoms of the new coronary patients they are currently treating are mild, such as physical pain and cough similar to those of the flu.
The head of the organization, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he visited dozens of patients every day, but that no patient needed to be hospitalized.
" They can control the disease at home, and most of them recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation... "
He said that this included elderly patients and those with health problems who were more likely to suffer from coronary infection.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of Delta disease, he treated the new coronary patient with "respiratory difficulties and low levels of oxygen.
Many will be hospitalized in a few days " .
Similar experiences were shared by other doctors within two weeks of the first reporting of the transformation of the Omikium strain in southern Africa.
Although it will take weeks to collect sufficient data, the doctor ' s observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30 per cent of new coronary patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks are seriously ill, which is half of the previous wave of severe diseases; the average length of hospitalization has been reduced from 8 to 2.8 days; only 3 per cent of recent coronary patients have died, compared to 20 per cent of early outbreaks in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, Director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute for Infectious Diseases and other reports: " At present, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease ... "
He also said: " It's still early. We need to get later data.
Normally, hospitalisation and death occur later, and we only enter the outbreak for two weeks ... "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effects of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta remains the world ' s leading new coronary strain, the case of Omikrum is emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases discovered in Haudun province during the first week of December increased by 400 per cent, and tests show that over 90 per cent of the cases of Omikium variants were recorded.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been delivered!

Education Review: What is it that saves abducted children?
If you compare the famous public service ads "No Deal, No Killing", then in a good environment without the demand for "kidnapping" there will be no repetition of such crimes, in which there will be no profit, no risk and no cost of trafficking.
In recent days, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security has launched a platform for the urgent release of information on the disappearance of children, which has been developed by the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the dissemination of information on the disappearance of children, and for the timely recovery of abducted children.
I've heard that app is called "reunion," and it's very warm.
New technologies are not only called " literary " , full of passions, but also well used, practical, effective.
The primary objective of the law-enforcement campaign is to find the abducted child and to protect his physical integrity and freedom.
Second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention, to legal education, can be cited in a number of terms.
However, priority should be given to the safety of the victims until the case of trafficking is solved.
The priorities, in the context of the eager "savory search", such as "whether child trafficking should be punishable by death" and controversial topics, can be set aside and carefully discussed; but the rescue of abducted children must not be allowed.
Based on the experience of the investigation of such cases, traffickers tend to stay away from the crime scene as soon as they can.
One minute delay in the search, the child may be further away from the parents, and the difficulty of detecting the case may add one point.
In this case, it is a pragmatic move to come up with an effective way of finding children and finding them, like a "reunification" platform that directly helps to detect cases.
After all, "kidnapping" is a big task that needs to be done by operating the entire system of the rule of law.
Combating crime, safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the soundness of legislation to the protection of the judiciary and the strict application of the law, does not require the implementation of child-friendly care.
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be done better, from home to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at a train station, and their parents fell asleep before they woke up and the baby was gone.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he or she should have at least a reasonable sense of protection ...
The two parents taking turns and resting, or placing the child under secure protection, are the minimum means of preventing the abduction of a child ...
On the other side of the police fight against trafficking, the purchase of abducted children should also be noted and punished ...
Individual wrongdoings tend to be a long chain.
According to our Criminal Code, the mandatory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is five years; in particularly serious circumstances, it may be carried out up to the death penalty and property confiscated.
The crime of trafficking in children is clearly a more severe crime in the light of the trend towards "lightization" with high starting points and maximum punishments.
But there are still a lot of cases of trafficking every year.
So, some people have a low perception of parenting and a low legal awareness.
Legal education for this group should be followed up simultaneously.
Effective control of the crime of trafficking cannot be achieved through strict official law enforcement.
If the "market" of abduction is widespread, the traffickers are motivated and innovative, creating a situation of "fighting" with law enforcement officials, the operation will be in a state of inefficiency.
Therefore, the elimination of backward ideas, the spread of legal literacy and the fight against trafficking and child trafficking can also contribute to the eradication of child trafficking.
Yang Hodong spoke at the 19th Plenum of the Party and the Provincial Council in Marongshan.
Draw strength from the party's hundred-year history of struggle.
On the morning of 10 December, in accordance with the unified arrangement of the Provincial Council, the Hunan daily newspaper (all media reporter Gomberway), the Provincial Council Standing Committee, the Provincial Council Minister of Communications, Yang Hodong, gave an interactive presentation at the Maungshan Video Innovation Park in order to learn more about the spirit of the implementation of the party ' s 19th plenary session, the spirit of the Xi Jinping General Secretary ' s important message to Hunan, and the spirit of the Twelfth Congress of the Province.
Yang Hodong, from his idealistic beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, party leaders and party theory, combines his own senses, personal experience, deep-seated, comprehensive and systematic elaboration of the core tenets and practical requirements of the spirit of the plenary.
He pointed out that the spirit of the plenary and the important instructions of Xi Jinping General Secretary to Huannan ' s important speech would be to combine the spirit of the provincial council, to learn from it, to strengthen the defence of the "two established" and to achieve the "two maintained" ideology, political self-consciousness, action self-consciousness and steadfastness in the direction of Xi Jinping General Secretary.
During the interactive exchange, representatives of grass-roots cadres, business representatives and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how the "two established" were understood to be decisive, how cultural enterprises were guided, how young people of the new era could draw strength from the history of the centennial party, how Yang Hodong spoke in plain language, how vivid examples were answered, and how he spoke with Al-Shabaab, drawing strength from the party's hundred-year struggles, united in close solidarity around the center of the party, steadfastly followed the party, writing responsibilities and assuming responsibilities with the youth dedication.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two broad categories, five levels, namely Virginia Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil.
First-fried olive oil, or what is known as natural olive oil, is the fat that is extracted directly from fresh olive fruit, which is mechanically coldly extracted through filtering, etc.
There are three levels depending on the acidity:
Extra Virgin: highest-ranking, highest-quality olive oil, pure natural product.
It's excellent. It's got the fragrance of plants with less than 1% acid.
Fine Virgin: slightly higher but not more than 2% acid, pure taste, aromatic.
Common primary olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): good taste and taste with no more than 3.3% acidity.
A refined olive oil is an olive oil derived from the refining of a fresh-fried olive oil of more than 3.3 per cent acid, or "secondary oil".
The refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: The refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of the first-fried olive oil in order to reconcile the taste with the colour, with acidity of less than 1.5% and transparent gold yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil extracted from and refined by solubility.
When you look at the classification, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olives are like grapes made of wine, from different production areas, olives of different olive species, produce different standards of olive oil.
Best growing ground for olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and temperature for olive oil growth, such climatic conditions as sunlight, air moisture and precipitation ...
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, the rest of the area can only be cultivated sporadically in suitable areas.
Main areas of production (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., with climate similar to that of Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on.
The month of the olive harvest:
In March-June of each year, the olive trees bloom and the fruits begin to grow and mature in July-October, turning from green to red, purple and eventually black.
It's the fruit harvest season from November to February.
Nutritional component of olive oil:
Olive oils are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, i.e. oilic acids and oily acids, nitric acids, vitamins A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the best oil for human nutrients in the oil found so far.
At the end of the Democratic Summit, Biden called the fire of freedom unscathed.
The online Democracy Summit, convened by President Biden of the United States and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, ended on Friday, 10 December.
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom was burning in the hearts of every man in the world and that authoritarian regimes could never put it out.
He also said that the second Global Democracy Summit was planned for next year.
The Taiwan government representative, Councillor Tang Feng, and Hong Kong Democratic Human Rights activist currently in exile in the United Kingdom, Rom Chung-seong, also addressed the next day's summit.
Biden said: " We know how difficult the work before us is ...
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I said before, as this summit showed, the democratic world is everywhere.
Despotic regimes will never put an end to the small fires of freedom, which burn in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world ... "
Biden also stated that the defence of democracy requires the concerted efforts of society as a whole.
He said: " As leaders of government, it is our duty to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the shield of democracy, to promote reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resistant to the forces of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good ... "
The themes of the second day of the Democracy Summit were, respectively, the defence of human rights, the consolidation of democracy and the right to confront it, and the fight against digital powerism and the affirmation of democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the same day, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, also stated that the cause of democracy faces global challenges, particularly those posed by the emerging digital technology ...
He said: " It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience ...
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls ...
It also requires the firm condemnation of all forms of populism, homeostasis and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution ... "
The Hong Kong Democratic Human Rights Actor, Mr. Raquean, addressed the Summit via a pre-recorded video alerting participants to the human rights situation of Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and Uighur and Tibetans.
He said: " For a long time, the world has accepted the rise of China without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable ...
That's why politicians and civil society leaders have to work together.
We must use all the resources at our disposal to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority ... "
Romone-sen also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, " Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy Secretary-General Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don ' t want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you are not aware of the threat to our democratic values. "
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
In a round-table discussion on "Combating Digital Autonomy, affirming democratic values", Tang Feng, the Governor of the Taiwan Executive Council, issued a "State Statement" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against dictatorship and power.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the new crown disease through transparency of information and confidence building.
He said: " At a time when democracy is on the rise in Taiwan, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global confrontation against authoritarianism and, above all, play a leading role in the promotion of global freedom, democracy and human rights ...
During the epidemic, powerful governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression ...
In Taiwan, however, we can control the epidemic without sealing the city, and we can defeat false information without falling behind ... "
In parallel with the second day of the Democratic Summit, the United States Treasury announced the imposition of sanctions in accordance with the law on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, Korea and several other countries, and the imposition of investment restrictions on a Chinese company found using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Why didn't you cancel it?
Hello. The saliva chicken from the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't keep up with it, so I'm looking for a practicer at a similar price.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices tend to be proportional to the level of friendlyness, and if you can't tell, expensive normal conditions are more friendly than cheap beats, and this kind of "introduction" is industrial garbage.
They're low-intensity, they're high on the beat, they're very vibrating, hard balls can't hold, and they're hard to handle.
The logic of their existence and the subterfuge is -- you know that tennis is so hard, you can't learn, you know that you can't afford to buy expensive things, you can't play twice, you won't fight again, so it's cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really tell what's good and what's bad, it means you're making progress. I'll come back and buy something expensive. I'll make twice.
It's recommended to pay a similar price, buy a better second-hand bat, choose a Prince, or Dunlop.
It's kind of friendly to newcomers, but it's easy to get past the newcomer phase, but most people, especially girls, can't get through the newcomer phase.
The order has been delayed several times.
Can I help you follow up?

Thank you.

For a little fat girl, you have to tell her the trick of dressing up.
Don't wear tight skirts, don't wear short skirts, don't wear them too short or stick them in a dress, it's uncomfortable to see them. If they're thick, they'll wear black stockings or netty socks.
Of course, the little fat girl's got a point on her skirt.
Fat girls wear short skirts and should choose the same color as short skirts, which will increase your height.
Short skirts with high heels make your legs look longer. It's the best in the summer.

"It's okay to think of a flesh wound" - Xinhuanet.
A girl standing in front of a big wooden board with the word "human target, ten dollars a arrow".
Last morning, a photo of a Hangzhou girl running for her sister's fundraiser blew the circle of friends.
Photos show a girl standing in front of a little taller plank in Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the word "human target, ten dollars a arrow" on the plank, indicating that a passerby can shoot with a bow and arrow when he pays.
The behavior provoked online discussions.
Last night, the chief of propaganda at the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau's lower city station confirmed to the Newjing newspaper journalists that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such an overstretched move on behalf of her sister, but that such action was not worth promoting and that the girl had left the local police station yesterday after being warned.
The girl's street goal collection was warned.
In an online picture, a long hair girl stood in front of a big board with black ink with the words "human target, ten dollars a arrow" on the board, with her bank account and micromail on the other board, payment of the Treasure account, etc.
The image is on the Internet and is controversial.
Some Internet users think it's "brow-eyed begging" and a lot of them feel sorry for it.
"We found out when we patrold the square around 10 a.m. 23, when the crowd was already watching... "
In an interview with the local media, the civilian police of the Tianhua police station near the scene stated that there were two girls in the stands, both of whom were about 20 years old, dressed up in a beautiful fashion.
Among them, the girl who's a human target is crying and begging the roadman to play this game; the other girl who's helping her friend's sister with leukemia is in urgent need of surgery, please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou to learn that the girl was collecting donations for the treatment of her sister ' s leukemia..."
Last night, the chief of propaganda at the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau's lower city station told the New King newspaper reporter that the girl was named Ji Jia Ri and raised money for her sister Jia Yan.
But because treatment still costs more than 300,000 dollars, there's no good way to raise money.
He said that, throughout the process, two girls had been targeted, one had been shot, but not involved, and no arrows had been found, but someone had watched and took pictures of them on Twitter.
The police then certified the use of bows and arrows by the security services.
According to the head of the office, " this kind of eye-to-eye fund-raising is not promoted " .
She left the station after police officers warned her.
Heating effects: Good, light, light, easy, skin quality: Satisfactory, magnanimous, always high-priced.
The new machine is very good.
It's stable. It's good for four vents. It's recommended.
It's a good game for the Golden Shadow Knight Dragon, so don't worry about the brand!
The price of the Dragon is still not very expensive.
Personally, it's really good for the Dragon, and the game works: the game works well, it plays most games, my chicken eats all the time, it's stable, it's very smooth, it's not easy, it's easy for CSgo to play most three-a games.
Heating effects: The radiator is good, the fans are good, the work is quiet, the game is all open.
Appearance material: pretty cool looking, the wind of the game. Showing effect: screen clear enough to play game 1080.
It's really nice to buy notebooks. They're designed for design. They're cheaper than you think. They're better than you think. The red on your ass is a nice color of wine.
It took two years to get into touch with the Lungi Night Rider. It took two years. It's worth a lot more and it's too good!
I've been recommended by friends around me to buy this product!
We've already bought this series of three machines!
It's beautiful. It's well configured.
I bought it for my nephew, wanted to wait for the 418 bank, so he bought it early, so he didn't catch up with the bank.
But it's good money, and it's good logistics. Let's go over it for a while.
It's a new, overvalued game laptop. It's a very good design style. Windows 11 and office 2019 have been installed.
Show effects: A child is bought for 3D rendering, the software is installed, the child says it's okay to use, and the computer works for 3D design.
It's for my son. He says it's good.
Computers are good, especially when the customer service is good. Just ask questions.
It's not bad. The quality of the game is real.
What's the hottest thing in 2021?
No doubt it's the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only the Olympics can win the prize?
There was an article "Look! The Olympic project where the project manager can hit the gold medal" in the previous period, which said that the project manager was definitely a leader in many projects: moving bricks, going on business, staying up all night was the day of the project manager, fighting fires, taking the fall, not to mention the apology.
An article that looks like a joke, but says that the day-to-day well-being of the project managers, behind them, is the incompetence of the current project management.
And the people involved in project management are increasingly choosing to take action to get themselves out of their jobs.
In terms of the number of registered PMPs (internationally certified project management professionals) that rise each year, an increasing number of project management practitioners are learning to upgrade their project management capacities.
According to China's 20-Year Development Report on Project Management (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP applicants across the country was nearly 600,000, the number of valid holders was about 420,000 certified through the PMP, and the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2 per cent of the total number of PMPs held worldwide.
The increase in the number of PMP holders over the past 10 years indicates that more project managers are realizing that it is no longer advisable to simply replicate the old experience, and that a rapidly changing working environment has taught us to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, would the PMP test guarantee that project management would be smooth?
Many project management beginners say that, by learning about courses such as PMP/IPMP, knowledge points such as the 10 major areas of project management and the five process groups can be systematically captured, but the real project management process is still a mess.
Many project managers often provide feedback on the following issues:
As a result, more than 10 years of focus on product innovation and R & D management have helped a large number of excellent enterprises to develop a large number of product managers, key R & D talent, such as project managers, and have received an online course on "Special Training Camp for R & D Project Managers" for China's Honorary Advisors, such as the China Model Training Base for Enterprise Research & Development Managers.
The "Research and Development Project Manager's Special Training Camp" online course, which is a way of learning online fragmentation, combines a number of operational cases of research and development enterprises, tools and methods to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of the project manager and move on to the path of your own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and fewer inputs to facilitate the development process of project managers and bring about efficient operational outcomes for enterprises.
The course is not only a team of experts from China and Tianhuaxia (formerly the R & D management team), but also an in-depth professional presentation of the course ' s content in the context of advanced international project management methodology and the real business landscape of many well-known companies.
It provides scientific and practical management tools and methods, a wealth of template forms to help participants translate learning into specific work after class.

On the eve of Jisin's "two-twelve" campaign to promote rational consumption to consumers - Economic Watch Network - professional finance news site
This year's double-Eleven Carnival national network pays $177 trillion in business transactions, up from previous years.
Once again, consumers have benefited from the proliferation of red bags and live-breeding beams, which, on the one hand, exemplifies the growing power of national consumption and, on the other hand, have had to calmly reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and on the mainstream consumption groups of the modern age.
On the eve of the two-by-two, the JTAC (hereinafter " JTW " ) launched a rational consumption initiative to alert users, especially young people, to good consumption awareness and habits and to reject blind consumption and overconsumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Analysis Report", published this year by the People's Bank, the national consumer finance literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
In general, our inhabitants perform well at the level of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in the different aspects of financial behaviour and skills, and there is a need to further upgrade basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy among older persons and adolescents is relatively low, and the "Aged and Young " will remain the focus of sustained attention in financial education; the "Report on China's Young People's Debt Situation", published by Nelson, and the "China Youth Consumption Report 2019-2020", published by the Treasury, show that the younger generation has great consumer potential, credit consumption becomes an important route to rising consumption, that 86.6 per cent of young people are using credit products, that nearly half of them have no accumulated debt, and that while the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend that is significantly different from the "excessive" label that is used by the outside world, some young people do over-consumption, followed by winding consumption behaviour, and thus create excessive financial pressures and debt risks, even leading to a gradual increase in social problems, and that financial enterprises should be courageous in their social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jiashin has been working to build a happy life for the people with quality and thoughtful services, to advocate for good and correct consumer perceptions, and to respond positively to regulatory calls for practical action to raise consumer awareness of rational consumption, especially among young people.
During the past few years, Tetsu has been carrying out a wide range of financial literacy activities for young people, including university students, and has helped them to build up their wealth by using a variety of forms, such as the launching of competitions for innovation and practice in cooperation with the country ' s top institutions, to provide rational guidance on the consumption needs of young people.
On the occasion of the bicentennial, Jiazu reminds all consumer friends to develop a reasonable sense of consumption and correct monetary perceptions, to resist blind consumption and overconsumption, to avoid consumer borrowing misperceptions and to avoid affecting personal letters and future economic life.
You have to plan ahead and pay back on time.
If overdue, overdue records will be recorded in personal credit reports, which may have a negative impact on future economic life, such as the purchase of cars and houses ...
At the same time, access to financial goods and services should be accompanied by a choice of formal institutions and channels, and care should be taken to verify the qualifications of the institutions concerned.
In the future, Jiashin will, as always, build on its maturity, a reliable consumer financial system and an up-to-date financial product to bring consumer-friendly and diversified services, constantly help the general public to raise financial literacy, help consumers develop rational consumption, the concept of modest lending, and become consumer-reliable financial partners throughout their lives.

Viet Nam People ' s Press Network - The Gulf Cooperation Council to address common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ' s stop include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAA), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this was the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since the imposition of the embargo on Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies in 2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed their diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf States signed an agreement for the United States and Kuwait to mediate a move towards "Solidarity and Stability".

It's called the New Mountain!
The car that our team brought to us this time is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship, Murcielago's replacement model -- Avantador LP 700-4!
It's worth almost two million. Ten thousand dollars a year. Four wheels. Why is it called LP 700?
Because with 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
The data says 0-100 km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, and it's probably the editor's Myvi who gets to 30 km/h, and he's 100 km/h.
The low body, the scissors door, the huge air vents all around it, and the glass of the 6.5 v12 engine, perfectly construing the Lamborghini style.
You don't have to say too much about the car. Just google yourself, make up a few little explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give you!
Too much attention. Everyone's watching wherever they go. It's uncomfortable!
1 km of gas is around RM1.
Get up and get out of the car and practice it, or it'll be a little awkward.
The engine sounds too loud to be deaf when you get out of the car.
It's too big, it'll be too narrow in the regular parking lot to get knocked down by the next car when it opens!
It's a little lonely because there's no opponent on the road.
Don't get me wrong. This video's not for sale. Sorry!

It's a million-dollar car accident!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that Chiron is one of the most expensive runners in the world, and Porsche 911 is worth millions!
A few minutes before that, a million-car crash in a few minutes abroad, 9/11, and a million overruns.
Look at the results. It makes sense!
Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonance with the Xinhua Network
The spirit of the university is the philosophy and the pursuit of values that a university has developed over a long period of time. It is the spirit of the university.
From time immemorial to the present, the spirit of university is essential for politics, the economy, culture, science and technology, the development of society, and even for the advancement of a people.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission that is different from that of other social organizations, and for our universities, the spirit of the emergence of the national crisis has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the evolution of the times, and the values of "Ming Dezie, " " "Kiji, " " " and "the patriotism of "the learned powerful" have been promoted.
At present, there is a growing trend towards information and internationalization of higher education, global competition for education, competition for science and technology, increasing competition for talent, and higher education as an important " supply side " , with structural reforms facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the General Programme for the Integrated Advancement of the World's First Class Universities and First Class Studies, which demonstrates the confidence and determination of our country to move from a higher-level to a higher-level-education-strong country, is a much more up-to-date demand for university development.
How can efforts be made to join the world ' s most popular class in a relatively short period of time and to accelerate the construction of a number of world ' s leading universities and world ' s leading disciplines, building on the gaps that still exist, to achieve a " turn-over "?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence, ability confidence, the university should take full advantage of three advantages: one is a posteriori advantage, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talent from abroad, learning from the best experience of the world ' s first-class universities, leading to a significant improvement in academic standards and the quality of learning; the other is a cultural advantage, continuing the intellectual content of the 5,000-year-old Chinese civilization, promoting the development of a culture of excellence as a means of cohesiveness, branding and image-raising; and the third is an institutional advantage, taking advantage of the institutional superiority of socialist nations, reinforcing the drive of objectives, pooling consensus, optimizing resource allocation and providing a solid and sustainable guarantee for schools to accelerate their achievement of the world ' s advanced standards.
In particular, it is important to realize that building world-class universities is unlikely to be the same, and that schools, while playing an advantage, must show their personality and identity.
The special features of the school must be Chinese in common, as well as a reflection of their unique objectives, traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we have focused on three features: one is to highlight the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurship development, to build an integrated science-based approach, to integrate the environment of parenting in schools, and to create a full-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; the other is to highlight the cross-disciplinary nature of the subject, to promote the optimal adaptation of the discipline system, to create a multidisciplinary institutional environment, to actively foster the cross-cutting emerging disciplines and landmark cross-cutting outcomes; and the third is to highlight the characteristics of the learning system and social services, to engage in in in-depth international exchanges and to accelerate the development of a cross-cutting research and cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to maintain the spirit of the university and to keep it in line with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, "Innovation" is the newest expression of the spirit: "Learning, Shooter, Clear, True "Common Values and "Heinar River, Enlightenment, Generous, Preborn, Tree State."
This is an important guarantee of the school ' s commitment to the right course, its growing cultural highness, its strength, its richness and its profound significance.
Among them, "Heinar River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, which is reflected in the idea of "the world's best talent for me" and in the idea of learning from the world's famous schools of excellence; "Ingenuity" emphasizes the spirit of truth and goodness, which means that universities, while pursuing truth, are more deserving of virtues of pottery and personality; "Inventive people" embodies the spirit of innovation of change, both in the search for new knowledge and in scientific research, and in the development of reform and renewal; "In the state of the tree, the spirit of patriotism, which says that universities should always be humiliated with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and values is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"The deaf hear the silent, the visible see the naked. "
China’s higher education institutions should build further on the Chinese character of the socialist cause, take a deep grasp of the age and historical mission of higher education, and speed up the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adherence to humanism and independence and the spirituality of the universities and the spirit of the times, as well as the spirit of nationhood, provide an inexhaustible impetus to achieve the country ' s prosperity and national renewal and to realize the common ideals of humanity ...

When NFT's rushing out, the encryption community comes up with a new concept.
In 2021, a block-chain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in South-East Asia, where some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income.
"Axie Infinity" is a game of pets based on block chain technology, which brings together a variety of games, including NFT, the top NFT project with more than $3 billion to date.
TokenTerminal data show that Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, pushing the King's Glory.
On August 6, this year, Axie Infinity officially reported that it has over 1 million live users.
The fever of Axie Infinity passes a new "palitoearn" model to more people, and through block chains and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, and can be involved in the management of game ecology in addition to having fun and economic benefits from the game.
This primaryity is not granted by the game maker, but by block chain technology.
When I see a news about the price of a friend's share, my biggest feeling is the choice of an enterprise in the track, i.e., the choice of an investment target industry, which first chooses to grow in a space of at least 100 billion market sizes; secondly, to choose a sector that will grow well in the future, and to consider an industry that will grow optimally in the next three to five years; and finally, to choose a sector with policy support.
How wide the track is in terms of market size, how long the track is in terms of the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or bumpy is in terms of the pattern of competition in the industry.
Let's go for the right track!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The trick is "do the things right," which means do the right thing.
And the strategy is "do the right thing," that's doing the right thing.
The strategy is to find direction, the tactic is to land, and there is room for strategic thinking on most tactical thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), it is possible to think about whether to continue to deepen in the current area or to expand in the lateral area (strategic thinking); on how to increase the retention rate of core and high-value customers (strategic thinking), for example, to think about how to increase the retention rate of core and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on how to set the right activity KPI to achieve the right activity objectives, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silencers, and sharpening it; and on raising the DAU (tactical thinking), it is possible to consider whether current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after birth, Bitcoin reached several milestones in 2021.
On 7 September, the small Central American State, El Salvador, established Bitcoin as the legal currency, which was the first time that Bitcoin had become a national or regional legal currency.
On 12 October, for the first time in eight years, the CSRC approved ProShares ' roll-out of the Bitcoin ETF and its listing on the New York Stock Exchange, marking a further expansion of the exposure of the first compliant Bitcoin future ETF to the United States capital market.
Bitcoin is not the main player in terms of the technological development of the block chain.
A soft fork upgrade called "Taproot" was conducted by Bitcoin on 14 November 2021, which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in the transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

U.S. Asian group complains about discrimination against students at three Ivy League schools, among others, Yale - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News, 23 May, Washington, D.C., United States of America, has filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice against three Ivy League schools – Yale, Brown and Dartmouth – which discriminated against Asian applicants in their admissions.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group's president, Zhao Woo-won, said at the launch that, while the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to American schools had multiplied over the past 0 years, the proportion of Asians in the three American schools remained essentially at the same level.
Many studies have shown that in the process of admission to the so-called "comprehensive consideration", these institutions " have a long-term continuity and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants " .
According to Zhao Woo-won, 20'4 years of research by scholars like Sanders show that Asians have the lowest rate of admission among all ethnic groups in these three institutions.
Data from the United States Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest rates of admission to Asian students, and Yale and Brown universities have applied a de facto racial quota to Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Woo-nong told Xinhua's journalists that they expected the United States Department of Education, the Department of Justice to be able to conduct an investigation after filing a complaint and, after establishing the facts, to take measures to prevent these higher schools from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions.
They also look forward to the initiative of the institutions of higher education to focus on this issue and to change the admission policy for Asians.
At present, the three institutions of higher education that were the subject of the complaint have not responded.
The Asian Education Union was founded in 20'5 when it complained of discrimination at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education did not admit it on procedural grounds.
This time, in addition to the Chinese-American group, it includes American Indian, Korean, Japanese, Pakistani education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Luk learned from the broker of a factory located in Yao Qin Township in Zhejiang and after several live visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy it.
In December of the same year, Mr. Luk, after consulting with the family of the owner of the house on the details of the purchase of the plant, sent a deposit of $200,000 through a bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Payer's down payment line", which states that "If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the down payment goes to the seller and if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the down payment is returned to the seller twice, and the parties agree to sign the contract within one week for the purchase and sale of the plant."
However, the subsequent lack of agreement between the parties on the main contractual terms, such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the manner of payment, resulted in delays in the conclusion of the purchase and sale of the house.
In view of the failure of the parties to reach a consensus on the terms of the contract, a few days later Lin returned the deposit of $200,000 to Mr. Luk.
It's hard to see the house, the down payment, the money, the contract, but the seller doesn't sell it, which makes Mr. Luk angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu has filed an indictment against Mr. Lin to the Yoo City People ' s Court.
The Court considered that the parties had ultimately failed to conclude a formal contract, could not be blamed solely on the defendant, that there should be a reasonable presumption that consultations would not be possible and that the penalty should therefore not apply in the present case, and that the defendant should not be held liable for breach of contract by double the deposit.
After the first instance judgement, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the sentence.
[Lawyer] Do the necessary due diligence in the course of the transaction.
When entering into a contract, the buyer has the necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying information on the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and specifying in the contract the specific time of delivery, place of delivery, in order to prevent disputes between the parties in the performance of the contract ...
Following Friday's Democracy Summit, the spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke on Saturday (11 December) that the United States hosted the Leaders ' Democracy Summit, which was "to use ideology, to use tools for democracy, to weaponize it, to act against democracy in the name of democracy, to incite divisive confrontations and to divert domestic conflicts " .
In the view of the Chinese Government, " the United States has long imposed its political system and values, pursued a " democratic transformation " , imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and promoted a " colour revolution " with disastrous consequences ...
Democracy has long become America 's intervention in other countries ' weapons of mass destruction.
The summit was an act by Biden to honour his campaign commitments.
The two-day conference took place by video, with 111 leaders from around the globe invited, including from Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States on the basis of its own democracy, saying that the United States was not in a position to host such a summit.
There are also international and domestic voices of doubt, such as criticism of the participation of leaders of authoritarian tendencies, such as those of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and doubts that the true intention of the Biden Government was not to organize the summit for the sake of democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The new German Chancellor Scholtz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit.
The statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday stated that " today ' s American democracy is a disease that is evident in money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social disintegration, ethnic strife, and the division of rich and poor " , and that democracy in the United States is a " game of the rich " based on capital.
In his statement, the President of the United States, Biden, said, " It is our duty, as leaders of our Government, to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the shield of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the forces of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and to those who want to seek power naked before the public good ... "
He stressed that democracy is not supposed to be, " We must keep it up to date in every generation, which, in my view, is the defining challenge of our time... "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "require the champions of democracy in the face of persistent and worrying challenges " .
The United States, for its part, is committed to a year-long initiative following this democratic summit, which will include a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that States will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the substantive democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022 ...
Biden said, " Let us all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year " .
All right. All I'm afraid is he sent the wrong address.

What's a red whiskey drink?
Everyone has a different hobby, someone likes to collect, someone likes to eat, and of course someone likes to taste wine. Red whiskey is one of the best Scottish whiskey ever sold in every country, and red whiskey has won the International Wine Award.
Every bottle of red whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it spoils its scent.
What about red whiskey?
Let me introduce you to the editor.
Red whiskey:
Johnny's red-carded whiskey is made of about 35 types of Scotch, with strong fragrance and traditional Scotch, and sweet fragrance and smoke.
The entrance is fresh, with a little vanilla and a strong smell of smoked wheat.
You can drink it directly with ice, or mix it with your favorite drink.
Red whiskey has entered the country and, in order to adapt to the country's taste, red whiskey + cola or snow paste or fresh miraculous beverages have become a constant fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being neutral and acidic, give people pleasure in visual terms, add drinks to them, and change their taste with a light drink.
Red whiskey + slices of lemon + sugar, the most authentic and traditional drink.
The real red flavour is a bit sour, the sugar can be included in it, and the lemon brings fresh fragrance to the wine, which, of course, can be adjusted according to a personal taste.
These three are the best wines of red whiskey, and you can try it as a reference, and hopefully the editor's introduction will help you.
Educational thinking: how university exams can make a big deal of Xinhua.
Three students at the University of Transport in Lanzhou wrote to the head of the school, reflecting confusion about the university examination and proposing to make it more difficult, to change the subject of the examination and to make it truly reflective of the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, college exams were a hot topic.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with varying levels of competence, combined with varying levels of learning, and learning varies greatly.
It is inevitable that a group of people with such diverse characteristics should be tested with different feelings.
Of course, if the test topics are single, the repetition rate is high and the subject is too simple, it will inevitably give rise to a different kind of feeling.
Students who don't have a job, they'll be able to do it before the exam, and if they think of another way, they'll be able to do it half-time.
So, there's a lot of "scumbags" who can pass without input, and even get high scores; "Babys" who don't drop out of school, do their homework, do their notes, and they don't get a lot of "odd status" on the test.
In this way, the high school attendance in Lanzhou reflects the fact that the problems in the university examinations are not without cause, and it is believed that this is not the only thing that exists in Lanzhou.
In this sense, I'd like to commend the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, it's not unusual for anyone who's been to college to know that they're ready to take a test, try to get a test range from a teacher, get a "privileged tutor" before they can get an exam, even if they've got a little quiz in the exam, and it's not surprising to ask a teacher for a high hand after the exam.
In my view, as a quality assessment guide for teaching, the success of a university examination is measured in terms of teachers ' overall knowledge of teaching and learning and the scientific propositions based on it.
With the entry to the undergraduate level, the specializations began to be broken down and many of the courses were based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that the basic knowledge of a discipline is the content of the university examination.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the subject, and the space for change is small and essentially fixed from the point of knowledge.
As teachers say, " 20 years ago, basic knowledge of university mathematics was still learning, or is it the focus... "
But the point of knowledge is essentially the same. It doesn't mean that the test is single, and the test is repeated.
In many universities, the examinations are usually part of a problem group, combined with senior teachers in the field, and the examination papers are attended by all the teachers who are responsible for the Section, thus overcoming some of the duplication of questions.
However, in order to develop a set of practical and practical questions that can be easily distributed according to the student ' s overall learning situation, there is also a need to integrate the teaching situation and to provide a comprehensive analysis of the student ' s level of learning, thus making the test ' s proposition difficult and dynamic, highlighting both the basic knowledge test and the competency test, as well as innovative design of the subject.
Examinations are the baton of university education. What kind of test is there, students have the corresponding preparation programmes, which, in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
With regard to letters of advice from students, Lanzhou attaches great importance to the University and has deployed rehabilitation programmes throughout the school.
The teaching units are required to organize self-censorships for examination and examination of the completion of the course, to develop the subject of the examination and the associated system, and to strengthen the monitoring and inspection of the subject of the examination and the examination process, to refine the evaluation of the results and to strengthen the comprehensive examination of the curriculum and teaching components.
The institutional solution to the single type of test, the duplication of topics, is one that the university will have to deal with, and the corresponding system will have to be put in place, but the effort is a daily one, requiring teachers to have a full grasp of the teaching, not only of the teaching content, but also of the students' learning, both of which will be better connected to the teaching and learning, and better interaction, and the examinations will be more realistic, so that the masters and the scum will get their share.

The cameraman was very funny, and he had a good time taking pictures all day.
When we picked the photos, because we saw a lot of cases online and didn't want the guests to delete them too much, but when we picked them, really, we didn't have any pictures, we didn't have 24 in the set, none of them.

Three hundred newborn babies in Sabah have no paper for making fake paper.
According to the Sabah National Registration Office, since the beginning of October, it has not been possible to issue birth paper to newborn babies due to the use of special anti-false paper stocks, with 3,200 people affected to date.
However, the director of the agency, Keruaminus, assured that all babies who had applied for paper were recorded on the system and that the paper would be reissued when it arrived next week.
At a press conference, he explained that there had been a 10-month story about the printing of a web-based Sabah newspaper paper.
He said that the problem arose two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
" One of the reasons for this is that Chinese manufacturers of specially made anti-false paper were affected by the epidemic, which delayed their arrival in the country ... "
He explained that the paper used in the Sabah paper was different from other regions and therefore could not be used for stock from other states.
Kerouaminus revealed that the latest anti-false paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on 8th of this year for partial printing.
"The Bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah to do the final printing immediately. It is estimated that the applicant will have two more working days (20 December) to hand them over ... "
"We'll notify the applicants to go to the local stations to pick up paper... "
He added that Sabah has sent 24,801 papers so far this year.
From 7:00 until now.
You're almost there, aren't you?
I'm talking about food.
I'm waiting on the other side of #PRS_ORG#.

Commentator for the People's Daily: "145" is a good start — learning to follow up on the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference — Xinhua Network
Xinhua News, December 11, Beijing, December 12, commentator, December 12, People's Daily: "145" is a good start — learning to follow up the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference
" Having achieved the "145 'good start " , the Central Economic Workshop, held from 8 to 10 December, took stock of the achievements of the country ' s economic and social development over the past year.
The Secretary-General of Xi made an important statement at the meeting, in which he gave an in-depth overview of the economic work of 2021, an in-depth analysis of the current economic situation, a significant deployment of the economic work of 2022, the preparation of the next year ' s economic work and the celebration of the party ' s twenty victories, which provided the way forward and provided a fundamental guide.
We solemnly celebrate the centenary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, officially proclaim the full creation of a small society, achieve the goals of the first century of struggle, begin the full construction of a modern socialist State, and embark on a new march towards the goals of the second century.
We convened the 19th plenary session of the Party to take stock of the party ' s hundred-year struggles and historical experience, and adopted the third historical resolution of the 100-year history of the Party, " Resolution of the Central Communist Party of China on the centennial of the Party ' s struggle and historical experience " , which is a political declaration by the Communist Party of China of the New Age, bearing in mind its original mission, to uphold and develop the socialism of China ' s distinctive character, and which is a guide for action to build the future and achieve the great revival of the Chinese nation, based on history.
Over the past year, the world ' s century-long major change and the global epidemic of neo-crowd pneumonia have been intertwined, the external environment has become more complex and complex, and the task of preventing and controlling the new coronary pneumonia epidemic and economic and social development in the country has been enormous.
The center of the party, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, insists on integrating the two major national and international agendas, maintaining the overall tone of the drive for progress, keeping pace with the centennial change and the century epidemic, integrating the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development, accelerating the construction of new development patterns, strengthening the cyclical regulation of macro-policies, investing in sustained and healthy economic development, investing in deepening reform and open innovation, striving to accomplish the daunting task of reform and development, and achieving new and significant achievements in party and national endeavours.
One important aspect of the successful start of the 14th Five-Year Plan is the new steps in shaping the new development landscape and the new results of high-quality development.
The country ' s economic development and disease prevention and control remain a global leader, with strong development resilience and high potential and dynamic features that continue to emerge; national strategic science and technology forces are growing faster, major innovations are competing, technological and innovation capabilities are increasing, key core technologies are closing in new breakthroughs; the industrial chain is becoming more resilient, foreign trade is increasing in volume and structure continues to be optimized, with new dynamic growth, represented by new patterns of new industries; reform openness is advancing further, focusing on limiting supply and demand and the flow of elements, creating new competitive advantages at a high level; human security is strong and effective, employment is expanding continuously, income is growing in tandem with economic growth, and is growing at more than 1.3 trillion pounds a year in seven consecutive years, and is enjoying an " 18-coup " ; eco-civilization is continuing, carbon is growing and working together, the pace of green low-carbon transformation is robust, and environmental protection is gaining new results.
These achievements are the result of the strong central leadership of the party, centred on Comrade Xi Jinping, of the scientific guidance of the Chinese-specific socialist ideology of the new era of Xi Jinping, and of the hard work of the entire nation ' s people.
It has proved once again that the party ' s establishment of the heart of Xi Jinping ' s central party, the central position of the whole party, the guiding position of Xi Jinping ' s socialist idea of the Chinese character of the new era, and the development of the New Era party and the State ' s career are decisive in advancing the process of the great revival of the Chinese nation ' s history.
With General Secretary Xi Jinping at the heart of the party ' s centre, the entire party ' s core leading the wheel, the scientific guidance of the Chinese-style socialist ideology of Xi Jinping ' s new era, and the unity of all the nation ' s peoples and their determined struggles, we will be able to overcome all the difficulties and odds and create a new era of glory in the new journey towards the full construction of a modern socialist State, and a new historic cause.
Next year's party's 20th, it's a big deal for the party and for the country's political life.
To promote the spirit of the Great Party, to maintain the general tone of the steady and steady search for progress, complete, accurate and comprehensive implementation of the new concept of development, to speed up the construction of the new development landscape, to deepen the overall reform and openness, to pursue innovation-driven development, to promote quality development, to maintain the emphasis on structural reforms on the supply side, to integrate the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development, to integrate development and security, to continue to work on the six pillars of stability, to continue to improve the lives of the people, to invest in macroeconomic stabilization, to keep the economy operating in a reasonable region and to maintain stability in the social sphere, we will maintain a stable and healthy economic environment, a social environment for the nation, a climate of social security, a peaceful political environment, and a 20-year victory for the party with outstanding achievements.
Let's unite more closely around the center of the party, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, to strengthen the " four consciousness " , to be firm in " four self-confidence " , to maintain " two self-confidence " , to constantly increase political judgement, political awareness, political implementation, to put the party's central decision-making into practice, and to keep moving forward with the new era of China's socialism.
Then I'll reorder it with points. Thank you.

48 hours of negative nucleic acid, buffer zone, State Department U.N.C.M.C. has issued a request to strengthen border-crossing urban outbreak prevention and control - Xinhuanet
On December 11th, Xinhua Society Beijing (Reporter Tse Fung Tianxing), the State Council ' s joint anti-negative mechanism issued a circular on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic in the port city, requiring personnel who have recently left the land border crossing city (with the exception of Hong Kong, which has a border with Macao) to have a negative test of nucleic acid within 48 hours and to conduct at least one test of nucleic acid upon arrival at the land border crossing city.
According to the circular, the time frame for the above-mentioned request is from the date on which the city of the port is determined and announced by the provincial and district municipalities until 15 March 2022.
In addition, it was suggested that municipalities at the ports where conditions exist could study the creation of buffer zones for outbreak control within the jurisdiction.
The head of the National Health Council ' s Disease Prevention and Control Department reported that cross-border trade was the main economic pillar of the local economy for some port cities, with frequent border crossings between the two sides.
The implementation of a differentiated management policy for subdistricts, from one to two lines of protection against spillovers, is expected to lead to front-loading and to reduce the risk of spillovers in order to minimize social impact and minimize social costs in order to achieve maximum effectiveness in controlling the epidemic.
In recent times, there have been a number of home-grown concentrated outbreaks in the country, all of which have been imported through port cities.
According to the circular, this has revealed a number of problems related to the lack of timely local outbreak surveillance alerts, the non-implementation of closed circuit management by high-risk personnel, regular nucleic acid testing in its form, the insufficiency of the cold chain and the irregularity of the management of centralized isolation sites, and the lack of scientific precision in emergency response to the epidemic.

Xinhua Network, a 20-year-old American bloodthirsty killing video.
(video source: pipeline)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary film called "The Killing Machine" from the pipeline was the subject of widespread concern.
The film describes the war waged in Afghanistan by the United States in the name of "Anti-Terrorism", the forced export of American-style democracy through war, 20 years of militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and crimes against humanity.
Misuse of drone strikes on hospitals, civilian sites such as schools, distortion of humanity, and the formation of homicide squads.
For 20 years, American forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. forces set up Black Jails to torture and humiliate suspects.
A crime against humanity has provoked more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American "war on terror" is becoming more and more scary.
War has not brought peace and democracy to the people of Afghanistan, hope for prosperity, but to a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Let's stick to the video, and let's tell the truth about America's bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism" and the false face of American democracy!
Unwittingly, the following article, from a commercial point of view, and from a preservation period point of view, explains why this customer wants a logistics company in the bonded area to make cans, although the cans are deep-processed and are not part of the operation of the bonded logistics company, and the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so.
I went to a lot of milk mills, and I got a lot of milk lined up.
Actually, the bags are exactly the same as the milk powder in the ears, and they're the same raw material.
Then one will surely ask: Why is the package preservation period one year, whereas the listening period is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between the cost of listening and the price of the bag so great?
In fact, a lot of consumers, or mothers, think it's better because the raw materials are different.
The raw material is just as expensive as the good.
There are also consumers who, out of this mentality, react and say that the taste or taste of a dress is different.
Now I'm going to tell you why it's expensive. Where's it going?
Why is the difference so great between their raw materials and their raw materials?
Because most manufacturers at pricing take into account the fact that it is difficult for consumers to accept a bag price if it is too high, which means that the manufacturer produces very low profits, or that there is no profit, and how does the manufacturer survive?
So they have a huge rise in the price of their suits to protect their profit margin.
So most manufacturers push for ears, not bags.
And if you think so many manufacturers pay tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year for advertising, how does that cost you?
You know what I mean.
So, as society develops, the marketing costs of marketing, for example: market promoters, shop displays, product gifts, advertising, etc., are also increasing.
So the manufacturers are constantly adding new items, and they're listening, and their prices are constantly rising, which is actually new as market costs increase.
The main objective is to earn a higher profit, and the cost of their raw materials will not exceed $3.4 at most.
And some brands, in order to promote their own products, do whatever they want to do, connect with the hospital's doctors, and they help with the promotion of their products, drawing profits ranging from $30 to $80 from one ear to the next.
The laws of China absolutely do not allow this kind of method of operation, which in fact harms consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder in the can if you have them at home, which would save money and increase the preservation and sealability of milk powder without any effect on children.
And let's not think that the shelf period is longer than the bag, if it is the same as the bag after the bag is opened, but that it is not easy to keep it after the bag is open, and it is prone to tidal deterioration.
It's too late to deliver food, it's cold, it's dry and hard, it's impossible to eat.

It's totally unacceptable.
Okay, okay.
But also remind the restaurant and the rider.
To avoid the next time.
I'd like to know the exact delivery time.
It's been a long time.
I don't know when.
If you cancel the order, can you return the money?
How do I pay the rider for his services?

Don't scare people on the starting line. Xinhuanet.
When you're in the book market, you can always feel the fire of a successful book.
Many of the successful books today promote the best principles — which is to assume or suggest that you can do it, and then tell you what you need to do."
It's like crossing the "how to do" link, which is really the most important, fundamental part.
And that's why all these books have a common feature — either they're doing the best they can, or they're not doing anything; they're 100, or they're zero; they're either you're going to climb the mountain, or you're just going to stay there.
This is the best principle, so everyone will admit to being right, but 99% of the people will be scared to the starting line.
Because this theory promotes a path of "You have to be determined, you have to be human again, you have to make a big 180 degree transformation," which is the fatal weakness of many people.
For a man who follows the rules and refuses to change, you're going to shout "You want to change" in his ear, and it's no doubt a self-deception, and it's an act of bull-playing.
The vast majority of people would be timid in the face of the word "transformation" and would not be able to make up their minds; or they would be determined by a moment's impulses and bravely take the first step, but often the good things would not last, and it would not be sustainable.
Mr. Marzoli's famous "start tomorrow" resounds like the most divine expression of this "universal humanity".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, that it often goes beyond the capacity of ordinary people and makes the vast majority of people look forward to it.
Perhaps the "better principle" is a way of putting more ordinary people on the path of relative success.
The core of the second best principle is to lower the threshold — it encourages a theory that if it doesn't, it can only do one: because one is always greater than zero; if it doesn't get to Tarzan, it can only get to the little dunes on your doorstep, because it's always better than it is.
Anyway, as long as you do something, it's better than not.
Because the threshold has been significantly lowered, there is a greater likelihood that ordinary people will stick to it, and that the chances of success will increase as long as things remain so.
It's just a little bit longer to follow the second best principle.
All in all, the "best principle " , despite its appearance as a flag of success for all, can ultimately inspire, in fact, a minority; and the " second best principle " can effectively inspire more people and benefit as many as possible.
So, do I need to reorder now?
There's no answer to the phone.
It's been delayed.
Not yet.
Excuse me, when will it be delivered?
How?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer. Thank you.
He missed two meals, but there's one order that's finished.
I'd like to ask how to contact the rider.
The first rider told me there should be another.
Xinhua Network, the nettural resources of Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 million tons this year.
Xinning, Xinning, Xinning, Xiaofei, Xiangxiang, Xiangxiang, Xinhua Society, was informed by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results show that the amount of barewall resources in Qinghai Lake was 0.71 million tons more this year than in the previous year, reaching 10,850 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times that of the early protection in 2002.
The popular name Qinghai Lake is "shopper" , a rare fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in sustaining the safety of the water-fish-bird ecological chain and biodiversity in the Lake Qinghai basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, as a result of massive human-induced killings and the increasing degradation of the environment in the naked-carved waters, the number of bare-walled Qinghai lakes fell sharply, with a mere 2,592 tons of bare-walled resources in the Qinghai lakes in 2002.
In 2004, in the Red List of Chinese Species, the naked wall of Qinghai Lake was listed as a endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the sealing of lake-battled fish, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual, from fishing for naked walls in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and the Lake Area, and from selling naked walls and their products.
At the same time, protection efforts continued to be strengthened through measures such as the artificial development of discharges and the clean-up of the main channel of the river into the Qinghai Lake, the design of a scientifically sound "fish crossing route" and the annual increase in the amount of naked resources in the Qinghai Lake.
According to Yang Lin, Deputy Director General of the Rural Agriculture Department of Qinghai Province, to date, a cumulative amount of artificial stock-raising has been implemented in the vicinity of 180 million tails, contributing more than 23 per cent to the restoration of the naked resources of Qinghai Lake.
The Qinghai Sanjiang region is an important ecological barrier and water cover area for our country and Asia, while Lake Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and an ecological function to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiang region and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife and preserve the biodiversity of the Qinghai Plateau, since this year Qinghai has launched a comprehensive anti-catch management system in the key waters of the Yangtze, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake.

I only get one bag from the restaurant. It's in the bag. It's cold.
I was wondering, is the takeout in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
Want to know if it's missing, or if someone took it, thanks.
It's been an hour. It hasn't even arrived yet.
I just saw an article on an official holiday. It's too long.
Give the unknown man Cope.
Most girls suddenly go through their first holiday at the age of 13-15 and close at the age of 50.
After that, it'll be more regular once a month.
But it's not regular enough to predict, it's about a week or so, it needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes it's bad luck to turn over.
The length of time, the amount of blood, the severity of pain varies from one person to another, some for three days, some for a week; some for less, some for a haemorrhage; some for a lack of reaction, some for an ambulance, some for a change over time, and not for a lifetime before.
I can't control my menstruation, bleeding 24 hours in the days to the end, and all I can do is suck the blood off my clothes and chairs with sanitary towels or tampons.
The pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostate herbs, and it's not good to eat after the onset of the physiotherapism to eat Brockine when it's not ready.
Pre-physiology is prone to diarrhea due to excess uterus and prostatesin releases.
If it's about the cycle, the diarrhea, it's almost two days before menstruation.
The sanitary towels should be replaced every two or three hours, otherwise they can easily breed bacteria, remove sleep time, and worst of all, six times a day, seven days a month, 42 pieces, if you add pre-prepared copies, which may be 50 pieces, not one per month.
(Modified here, tampons don't have to be changed much, maybe five or six hours, up to eight hours)
The menstrual hormones can get a little irritated, and the ovulation period can be unstable because of the hormone changes in the body, and it's bad luck, and the body tripped itself.
But the official crime rate figures show that women still have a high degree of control over emotions, and they don't make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood, it's got a deplete uterus.
After the menstrual period, the membrane is the thintest, and then it gets thicker, and it's understood that the womb is the house, that the house is built every month (the membrane gets thicker) to meet the guests, that the guests are not here, that all of them are torn down next month, and that the new house is built again and again.
For decades, menstruation is not easy, it bleeds 24 hours a day, and it hurts. Who wants to?
But a man can be born because his mother comes to her menstruation, to prepare you for the first time in the world to live in a house for 10 months, and to thank your mother for her regular healthy menstruation.
A lot of women used to be crushed, and society brainwashed women about being dirty, ashamed, thought that was it, but times changed.
If someone feels sick about menstruation, that the woman's body is sick of preparing for life, that it should not be said in public, that the girls stand up, that they will not think about it, that they will never experience it, that they will never experience it, that they will never know it, that men will not be so ungrateful as to know what to do with their mother.
Finally, the girls try the tampon. It really works.
It's winter and holiday. It's a disappointment to send the wrong ones.
We have to order something else for the kids.
I hope the shop has to check out the product while it's busy.
Is there a power leak in the tub?
The choice of the right foot bath can be a good part of health care, and today the U.S. and U.S. editor will answer this question in the hope that it will help our friends.
As people's health awareness increases, the tubs are becoming more popular with consumers, and a large number of different products are emerging in the market, giving consumers a lot of room for choice, ranging from a hundred to thousands of dollars.
On the surface of the relevant data, the sale of health-care appliances, such as the foot baths, is on fire compared to traditional home appliances, but there are no industry-specific standards for the foot baths and there are therefore certain security risks.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in the electrified water!"
Mr. Lee told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father to present his birthday, but when he had his feet he felt numb on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Lee thought it was the vibrating function in the tub, but he didn't think he was going to turn off the vibrating function.
Mr. Lee tried it with a pencil, and the pen was lit, and Mr. Lee was surprised to find the water in the tub with electricity.
Then he contacted the merchants, and the merchants had a good attitude, and Mr. Lee was still upset, despite falling out of the tub.
Because he found that the already popular footbasket today has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the highest temperature set, which groups of people it applies and which materials it guarantees no harm.
But normally, there's no electricity problem in the tub, but it doesn't rule out that a few products are not strictly shut down when they leave the plant.
So, when you buy it, you choose a split tub of foot baths.
Water and electricity are separated. There's no safety problem.
At the same time, you can take any pen you want.
Opening of the thirteenth provincial tea fair - Watch the headlines - Hunan Daily News
This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Fair and the Newly Modified Red Tea Promotion will be held at the Hunan International Fair Center to demonstrate the tea industry, innovation in tea technology, promotion of a tea culture and acceleration of the multi-billion-dollar tea industry target.
H.E. Mr. Ye Hong, Deputy Director General of the National Council of Supply and Marketing Cooperation of China, was present at the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Jong-hwa of the Chinese Academy of Engineering presented at the opening ceremony: the source of the lake's red and the rise of red tea gave a new impetus to the "Four Colors of Salmon Tea".
In recent years, the provincial council, the provincial government, has strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of the hundreds of billions of tea industry and forming a pattern for the development of the three-square four-water tea.
Intra-provincial tea communities have increased their innovation, green tea, black tea, red tea, and other main teas, and the integration of tea brigades in the main-producing tea areas has led to an increase in the harvest of a large number of tea farmers.
There's a turn in the wind, and the red tea's working again.
According to the provincial tea industry experts, after green tea, black tea, tea farmers are paid four seasons a year and the value of tea gardening is rising.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leadership awarded the fourth batch of companies authorized to use the Hunan red tea brand to give a new name to the Lake Red Source.
At the red tea conservatory, Fujian tea dealer saw a high mountain tea called "Spring in Ice" and placed an order immediately.
The Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, Brigadier-General Wang, is pleased to say that the current epidemic, among other factors, affects the tea market to a greater or lesser extent, but from the site of the tea fair, the bright spots appear.
A red red tea fills up the tea culture, the human race, the trade fires, and the tea industry to welcome the new spring.
So if the food isn't hot, can we cancel it?
I don't want it. He couldn't bring it up because he couldn't stop down there.
To go to school is to study, through rational reasoning and logic, questions that cannot be answered directly by perception.
To go to school is a philosophical basic law designed to explain the very nature of existence and of the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "Mother to School" is taken from the word "Metaphysic" and the word "Metaphysic".
The physical branch of schooling consists of the theory of nature, theology of nature and its extension.
It's called "the study of which terms represent the real entity of existence and which terms only represent a concept."
The physical nature of schooling means denying the existence of God.
It is based on the idea that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural justification, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
And the method of naturalism is the way to study the word "God."
Psychiatry is the philosophical branch of the study of consciousness and the nature of their relationship to the body, especially the brain.
The dualist and monist are the two most important ideas in the discussion of the relationship between the mind and the flesh.

Ethics is a discipline for systematic reflection and research on the moral life of mankind; here, morality is defined as all norms of conduct recognized by a group of people or by a culture.
It is divided into meta-ethics (researching the essence of ethical theory or criticism in abstracto), normative ethics (judgment of different moral values, and moral advice on correct or wrong behaviour).
It looks at the moral codes of conduct that people should follow, applied ethics (academic application of ethical theory to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), describes ethics (gathering information on how people live, drawing conclusions from observed patterns).
It does not look at ethics based on preconceived theories, but rather investigates the real moral choices made and observed, which contribute to all the ethical elements of the decision, and examines the ethical values held by the community.
The history of ethics includes Roman ethics in Greece, medieval Christian ethics.
Part I: Ethical idea of humanism, represented by Vala and Monda et al.
Part II: Ethical ideas for religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: Ethics in politics, represented by Machiavellian et al., Ethicalism in modern times (Ethics of Empiricalism in England in the 17th-18th century, Ethnomus et al., Ethnosa et al., 18th century, Enlightenment Ethics in France, Ethos Voltaire et al., 18-19th century, German Academy Ethes, Ethics on figures: Kande and Hegel et al., 18-19th century, Ethics of Merriculturalism in England, Ethics in England, Ethics of Evolution in England in the 19th century, Ethermology of Spence and Herschner, late 19th century, Ethics of Newcommony in Germany, Ethics of Neanderthicism in the late 19th century, Ethics of New Haguel, Ethics in the 19th century, Ethics Thomas Hill Green et al.), Transitional Ethes (Ethics of Unrationalism, Ethics on personalities: Krkkekegelkoll, Uberbundice and Nitz).

Ting: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for the humanitarian assistance they have provided for more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since my personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends, both within and outside the country in early 1994, has not been interrupted so far.
Today, the great majority of the dead have lost their parents, and the orphans have grown into domestic employment.
It's your duty to help our troubled families through the most difficult times.
The new crown epidemic is now raging around the world, and most donors are retiring from their lives.
Therefore, I implore you to suspend the humanitarian donation to our host, the Tiananmen mother group, which should have been the perfect end for this humanitarian operation.
I will always remember your love and be sure that your deeds will be remembered for history.
For a variety of reasons, I can only express my will in this way and ask my friends to understand!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Tau: Allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief presentation on the 32-year history of humanitarian relief by the All-American Federation of Sciences (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation (MCDF).
In the course of humanitarian relief, the All-American Association and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, with project implementers often cross-cutting.

It's not always easy to get the bail money into the hands of the world's most difficult people.
In 1994, she suggested that a special unit be set up by the Tiananmen mother to coordinate and handle the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MDDF established the "Six Four Orphans Education Fund" and, 11 years after its implementation, in 2009, after all six or four orphans graduated from the University, the MDDF subsequently established the "System Support Fund for the Six and Four Orphaned Old People" and has been in operation ever since.
These projects were funded mainly by school and social donations in the six or four years, by generous donations from individuals and by support from the Fraternal University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Re-education through Labour Research Foundation.
Until last year, 31 years later, six of them finally received a portion of their contributions from Hong Kong in the name of six or four.
In the meantime, Human Rights in China is implementing their humanitarian aid projects independently.
We understand that Mr. Ding's request for a six-four donation is for the sake of donors, and we are indeed all retired old people whose income is not as good as before retirement, and we would like to thank Mr. Ding for his "friendship" letter.
We will respect their decision to terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as necessary.
To those who have been so generous and risking to deliver humanitarian aid for so many years, thank and pay tribute to them.

Thanks for the rabbit's comment.
Thanks to Dandan's approval, your satisfaction will keep us in charge, and we will continue to cheer!
This photo studio is really great, and it's highly recommended to all the young people!
From reception, makeup, costumes, lights, photography to the end.
The make-up man is so delicate, he'll match your style with his makeup, and he's got a big line of makeup.
Don't mention it. Photography is quite professional.
The studio was very artistic, with two kittens playing with it.
We're working in Beijing, we need to line up six months ahead of Beijing.
I've been looking for this studio, a place where spirits have attitudes.
Our facial expression is less well managed, and we think it's a short version of most people.
Make-up artist, photographer, late design, a fine team.
We're all here in a movie, and we're all here.
We've recommended our best friend to the past, and our best friend just saw the negative and was happy as well.
Let's hope this studio is not buried. More people find it and film it as their own, not as always.
Thank you very much for taking the eagle, for Ling's five-star reviews, for both very thoughtful and creative newcomers, and we're creative studios, and if customers like us, we'll do our best to get to know each other.
The sweet and sweet assistant, the lively photographer teacher, everyone on the team was super nice for a wonderful shot, hard to forget, and it was a lot better than I thought.
Thank you, Xiaoyu, for knowing you is also a matter of fate, and trusting us from Hu and Hut to the island of Qin is thousands of miles away.
How do I pay?
The food has been delivered.
No rider to receive.
Now the restaurant clerk called me.
A programming white that wants to share personal experiences.
If you want to enter the industry, you can choose a place to train, but if you don't, it's better to learn on your own, after all, because it costs a lot and takes six months to study.
But training is a very good option, especially for those who are self-sufficient and weak.
If you're more self-sufficient, you can choose to learn yourself, but you're tired.
Of course it's very important to choose a good training institution.
It depends first and foremost on the teaching staff of this institution, which has little meaning if it is not strong enough, and certainly not very strong in some of the new training institutions.
Second, to visit this institution before choosing it, it would be better to look at the students from this institution, after all, only the students in this institution know what it is, and the course is good or bad.
Hello, I don't know how to answer that question, because you don't have a lot of information about yourself, and learning about it is very much about yourself.
Professionals, ages, languages that you want to learn, even in a city, have something to do with what you study or want to do.
If you're a student and you haven't graduated yet, or if you're a computer major, if there's enough time for me to personally suggest self-study, this is the least efficient and cost-effective, and many of the lower-line training institutions are actually very good, but they're expensive, they're more time-consuming, they're more time-consuming, and they're trained in basic needs for three to six months.
But if that's what I'm saying, self-learning is easy, and many of the learning resources on the Internet are now free, or there's a lot of training resources at station b. If you don't find resources, you can contact me through a profile, get free resources, or a detailed consultation.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with videos.
If you're not a computer professional, but you can pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, then it is recommended that you study in a training institution so that it doesn't have to be hard, the teacher speaks in detail, there are questions and answers, and it helps with learning planning or supervision.
And there are now many training institutions that sign employment agreements, have in-house jobs and recommend to the company after studying, so that the job-seeking interview later can save a lot.
That's some of my thoughts, and because I don't know what you're doing, it's not very detailed. If you have anything else to consult, you can contact me at any time.
I said, "At 1 o'clock, I saw it at App."
What do you mean?
I'm not finished yet. What are you doing?
I, under various circumstances (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-heating water heaters, water purification units, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, smokers, lamps, glass cleaning, professional seams, domestic service
Thank those who gave me credit for trying hard for my life.
Life doesn't fail every hard-working man.
That's what life is like, people just look at the outcome, they stand alone, and we face life with strength, we just keep going, we have no choice but to look back, but we can't go back...
Cleaning is work, it's duty, life is beautiful with service, and service is good with heart.
Cleaning is the dirtyest thing we do, but we'll clean every corner of the client's house with the utmost seriousness, and we'll see the smile of the customer's satisfaction and the thumbs up.
My day-to-day work.
- Your request, my service.
Use your heart, clean your heart, keep it good.
The details you're concerned about, Fung Gui's housekeeper did you a "clean" job. I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can,
It's clean, it's homemade, it's served, it's home clean.
Keeping clean inside and outside. My daily work.
Crystal lamps are gorgeous, but they'll be dark without washing for a long time, and they'll shine only after cleaning, and so will life.
You can do it with your heart, you can shape it carefully, and we're serious about the seams.
Give me a chance to make you happy. Quality means everything, because the profession is trustworthy, and your approval is my best encouragement!
It's not easy to do everything in the world.
But I always believed that if I was serious enough, insistent enough, hard enough, I'd be a little better than others, at least better than sitting there complaining."
The idea of a day is that in the morning, all the beauty begins in the morning, and I hope you carry happiness, luck, health, as you wish, and start a new day and stay in a good mood all day.
When I was a kid, happiness was something that I had; when I grew up, happiness was a goal that I achieved; when I matured, happiness was a mindset that I understood.
Be the truest and the kindest of yourself, and walk by heart, and live without regret; live by one path and by one path; live by two treasures: good health, good mood, beautiful and old!
At every stage of life, there are different kinds of problems.
Too many times, you're not tied up with power, but with the courage to face it.
If you can't hide, just face it.
The more afraid you are, the harder you are to be knocked down; if you face it, it will be solved.
Xinhua Network, the first Saudi biennial exhibition of contemporary art.
Xinhua Society's first two-year exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia — the two-year exhibition of contemporary art in Diliye — was officially opened to the public on December 12th, in the Diriya JAX Art Zone, north-west of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, etc.
The biennial exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Diarya Biannual Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Yurens Contemporary Arts Centre of China, where the UCCA Yurens Contemporary Arts Centre of China is headed by the Director General of the Arts.
According to the panel, the theme of this two-year exhibition is " Touching the River with Rocks " , a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of socio-economic transition, which also reflects the current situation of socio-cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This bi-annual exhibition, which covers nearly 12,000 square metres, spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: " Touching a stone across the river " , " Passage as an experiment " , " Thinking on the edges " , " Walking to the public " " The Beautiful New World " and "The Spirit of Artism " .
Of these, 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40 per cent of the exhibit in various forms, including paintings and the installation of arts and performing arts; 12 Chinese artists were also of interest, and some of them created in innovative ways using recycled materials, such as Xu Ice ' s Reconstructing of a classic mountain painting with waste in " The Endless Map of the Story Series " (2014).
Barclay, Chief Executive Officer of the Direier Bienennial Exhibition Foundation, expressed the hope that the current biennial exhibition would create an international dialogue that would give a global audience an opportunity to learn about the flourishing cultural industries and creative communities in Saudi Arabia and to enhance interaction.
" The objectives of the biennial exhibition are twofold, allowing both Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and Saudi viewers to be integrated into the contemporary art world ... "
It is understood that a series of lectures, artists, advocates and opinion leaders from the creative industry will be held during the biennial curtain week to discuss the themes of cross-cultural communication, contemporary artistic development, etc.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public service job management - Xinhuanet
On December 12th, Xinhua Society Kwangming (journalist Lim Bingfeng) launched a policy to promote rural renewal of public service jobs in Yunnan Province in order to promote sustainable employment support for the poor and consolidate the gains made in the fight against poverty.
According to the Director of the Yunnan Human Services Department, at present, 448,300 rural public service jobs have been developed in Yunnan for the employment of rural disadvantaged groups, such as the labour force, and play an important role in helping people out of poverty to achieve employment gains, consolidate the gains from poverty eradication and effectively upgrade the capacity of rural public services.
The new regulations, issued jointly by the Yunnan People ' s Society, Rural Renewal, Finance and others, regulate the scope of recruitment of rural public service workers at the grass-roots level, the management of funds, job development, job management, etc.
In terms of job development, the new regulations specify that they are based on the principle of "as-you-go-as-you-go-as-you-as-you-go-as-you-as-you-go-as-you-go-as-you-go-as-you-go-as-you-go-as-you-go" principle.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with such steps as announcement, declaration, review, publicity, recruitment, pre-service training and induction.
In addition, the new regulations define the specific responsibilities of the main development sectors of rural public service jobs, the criteria for subsidizing rural public service jobs and the means of subsidizing them. They stipulate that all rural public service job development units shall purchase commercial insurance for accidents in rural public service jobs; and require the relevant authorities to monitor on a regular basis the granting of subsidies for rural public service jobs.

Two, although the right is not long in history, it's short because it's sunny, it's sweaty, it's watery, it's hard to look, it's hard to see.
But as a matter of fact, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied from the definition of truth in the context of the end of the cultural revolution, the development of the economy to improve science and technology, and the promotion of administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantees.
Thirdly, as far as I'm concerned, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's claims, I care about him and respect him, because he's serious, he's serious about China and he takes Chinese social problems seriously.
But I object to his anti-communist theory, and I believe that contrary to the necessary revolution, the revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, the loss of human life, the chaos of political groups, and foreign invasion.
Fourth, change or improve China's attitude of patience and national responsibility, and political speculators, not right-wing, asshole.
Let's talk about left.
Left, it's a bunch of time and politics.
If the right is socially positive and the Communists listen to the right and analyse their ideas when they need it, then that is not what is left, because it is the Communists who throw away the bad things!
Five, I don't think it's necessary to see some of my friends go to war with the rebels.
Don't try to be reasonable with the traitors and the left.
And don't try to prove that we are right, let alone try to get the rebels and left-handed to confess. Why?
And thus We told our friends that when the rebels scolded you with 50 cents, and when the left scolded your right dog, it proved exactly the right way in the middle.
Many of them have ideals when they're young, when they're old, they forget them, or they're after them, but they're paranoid.
And the ideal is getting away, and even the dragon-slayering youths are becoming dragons.
I think that generally means restraint and freedom, and that China's genetic origin from historical culture leads China as a whole to the left.
And the national right is free to focus on efficiency and development, the left to strengthen regulation, equity and security.
The general desire of society now is to be more equitable, while the Chinese and the United States compete, the left is certain, and is expected to last for many years.
I can't read it. It's over if it's nice.
That's what flowers are for.
In the last two years, the blockade and siege of the Emperor's microchip have not only left the country in an unprecedented state, but has also caused huge losses to the United States.
The direct consequence of the US Emperor ' s crackdown on China ' s chip industry and its demand that its own enterprises and allied companies block the chip industry at the same time is the impact on global chip suppliers ' orders and profits, resulting in lower R & D inputs and lower production capacity in chip producers, thus creating a global shortage of chip supply chains.
Today, the missing core has affected major industries around the world, such as the shutdown of cars, the increase in the price of mobile phones, and almost all of the industries that use chips.
In order to take control of the chip, the technology giants of a growing number of countries are beginning to go down the path of "decapitization."
In order to assert control over the global semiconductor, to control the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, and in recent times, to host the Chip Summit, and to invite the 64-Power giants to form a semiconductor alliance, and to make money available to support American indigenous technology giants, such as Intel, the old tech giant of the United States Emperor, in order to regain dominance in the chip field, spend $20 billion on two crystal-crystal processing plants in Arizona and open chips to the outside.
When most people think that this move by Intel will have a certain impact on the power supply, there's a good chance that it will be taken from the job.
The reason for this is that Intel, as the old technology giant of the United States of America, has been plowing for decades in the semiconductor field, with a huge pool of talent and technology, must rise rapidly in the short term to defeat the power supply.
However, on Intel's decision, the founder of the power plant, Mr. Zhang, did not take it seriously.
In April of this year, at the "Senior 2021 Think Tank Forum", Zhang's scheming was amazing, and he was unconscionable about Intel's efforts to build a crystal mill: Intel built a chip-for-the-work factory, quite ironic.
Jang's loyalty to Intel's march into the crystal circle is due to the fact that Zhang's loyalty to the power buildup and the Intel's cleavage more than 30 years ago.
In the '60s and '70s, Intel was always a bead in the manufacturing industry of the United States of America, and he was at the top of the world and a master in the world's semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips had been held by a few powerful men.
The semiconductor industry was characterized by the IMM model, and the chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
This pattern, however, overstretched some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs faced huge production-line construction costs.
In the 1980s, a division of labour began to emerge in the chip industry, inspired by market demand, and in 1984 Zhang, after hearing about a company that specializes in chip design, thought that a factory that specializes in crystal-crystal manufacturing could be set up.
Soon after, Zhang's idea became a reality, and power was delivered.
The station power has targeted the main business at the single link of "crystal processing", which is not designed, but provides proxy services for crystal-crystal manufacturing.
The power generation that was just created was just a small one in front of Intel's giant.
In order to gain capital support, Zhang's loyalist had invested in Intel, but when Intel heard that power was only made in the chip industry, it became clear that there was a certain amount of self-esteem, that there was no room for electricity and that there was no investment in electricity.
Jang's loyalist also decided that Intel was underestimating the crystal-crystal process.
I didn't think the giants who looked down on the crystal-crystal manufacturing service were going to start working in the crystal-crystal era.
So Jang's loyalist thought it was ironic that Intel entered into the crystal circle.
Today, the market for electricity has surpassed Intel.
Intel is naturally afraid to stand firm in the face of the power surge.
Today, the battery has hit the 3nm chip, and Intel is still at the 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.

What's normal love?
The random selection of three hot spots: February, when the Dragon looks up, when the best friend increases prices, when the drops of the troughs spread into a peak, the [indicator drops] (sliding curves) eventually dissipates, and when secondary migraines are created, the little camel peaks reappear.
They appear to be the same as the webmaster's display of an evolution of the Internet.
What's an anomaly?
The random selection of six heat searches in the same incident, showing [single peak], [sawing], [break cliff].
[single peaks] are artificially heated, rapidly rushing to heat, causing public attention; [sawing] is periodically heating to ensure that the subject is hot on the list; [breaks cliffs] is a group retreat, and the hot search is functional, and the hot search is on a new mission, heading for the new battlefield.
In figure 9, one event's hot peak is exactly another event's valley, with no time difference, and must be a unified water force on board to launch a new offensive.
The specialization of black PR can be seen in the dozens of hot and hot searches, which are attracted, which are responsible for the op, which are directed, which are transferred, which are informed, which are misleading judgements, which are inflammatory, which are held hostage, which are divided into black accounts, which are finely versed, taking into account almost all the elements of the spread of the phenomenon.
It's a science, it's a science, it's a science, it's a science, it's a science, it's an emotion, it's all subjective, it's just objective data, it's a black PR.
We'll dig it out together. We'll dig it out.

Xinhua Network, the first case of Omicone drug strain infection, has been detected in countries such as Mauritius
Xinhua News, December 12, Beijing, Integrated Xinhua News, reported that Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi had reported for the first time in recent days the infection of the Omicium strain of the new crown mutation virus.
Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of Omikium infection in the country on 10 October.
According to Minister of Health Mau Kelesh Jagutepar, one of the infected was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on 27 November from South Africa; the other was a local Mauritian resident who, after contacting a person who had recently returned to South Africa, tested positive for nucleic acid on 30 November.
Following hospital isolation, the results of the nucleic acid test were converted to negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
Cyprus ' s Ministry of Health announced on 10th that it had first diagnosed three cases of Omik zirconium infection ...
All three were students who returned from abroad earlier this month and were not admitted to hospital due to mild illness.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicine strain, the Seymour government has been increasing its efforts to prevent and control the spread of the virus.
From 6 December to 10 January next year, passengers over the age of 12 who arrive by air are required to take nucleic acid tests at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health of Serbia also announced on 10th that it would begin vaccination against the new Pfizer vaccine for children between 5 and 11 years of age in the country.
The Minister of Health of Malawi, Kambize Chibunda, said on 9th that for the first time, the country had found three cases of Omikium infection.
The country ' s health sector sequenced 12 neo-coronal positive samples from 9 November to 2 December, and found three cases of infection.

At first, a friend introduced me to trust, so I chose to look at my initial budget of $70,000 for a basic renovation.
A series of tricks started at the store.
The first time I came to the store was to show them my family chart, and they didn't actually check the house, and they offered me a price of $70,000 for my 135 house, and they probably showed me their material and they didn't know what brand they were.
Their second set of tricks is that you're gonna drag you to the store to pay the deposit.
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they'll invite their so-called manager to tell you how much you'll get if you pay the deposit today.
This is a big hole, and I'm a living example of being cheated, making over 10,000 deposits in an impulsive mind.
He gave me a lot of questions about $70,000, which did not include water and electricity, any doors and cabinets, bathrooms, and those three were the big ones for the basics.
They charge more for their services than any other company.
I lost my trust in this company, so I signed the contract without saying anything.
When I went to get their money back, they showed up with experience, and they had a special team to deal with you.
It's the client's problem anyway, and they're not responsible for it.
All sorts of responsibilities, lots of details, no tears, no choice, because my friends are looking for their renovated houses, and they're gonna charge you a lot later.
Dad, they're the deluded Dragon Head Decorations, now it's Dae-mi. It's like they're closed and changed to something else.
So let's not go to the decorator's place like this.
You're gonna have to look at all these consultations as you choose to do, because the renovations aren't small money.

The saliva chicken is supposed to be ripe, but it's raw meat.
There's about a pair of twin meteor showers in the sky.
Xinhua Society experts in Astronomy, Tianjin, 12 December, introduced that, as one of the last major meteor showers this year, the twin meteor showers of one of the three meteor showers in the northern hemisphere will rise on December 14th, and friends who like meteor showers will be able to observe in the middle of the day.
On December 13, 2018, a Beijing astronomer was shot in the Qinghai by a twin meteor shower.
Most of the meteor shower parent bodies are periodic comets, but the binocular meteorite parent bodies are the same as the 3200 asteroid, an Apollo asteroid.
The twin meteor shower is also the second meteor shower known so far not to be born by a comet.
Astronomy Boarder of the City of Tianjin, an expert from Astronomy, Choki Peng, explained that, as in the case of a big film at his age, binary meteor showers usually occur at the end of the year, and that the "sending period" can run from December 4 to December 17.
The meteor shower, known for its high flow and stability, along with the uniscope meteor shower, the Anglican meteor shower, is known as the three meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the bipolar meteor shower is the slowness of meteoroids, their rich colours and the abundance of fire meteors, which are suitable for viewing and for the shooting of astronomers.
Tianjin City Astronomer Yang Xiao, shot on December 13, 2020 in Tianjinsi County by a twin star shower.
Astronomer forecasts indicate that this year's bipolar meteor showers will rise at about 1500 hours on 14 December, when ZHR (the number of meteors per hour can be seen when the radiation point is at the top of the head under ideal observation) is 150.
A table of recommended indicators for the Gemini meteor shower.
"Last year, there was an impressive bipolar meteor shower, but this year's bipolar meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight and a little less spectacular.
On November 11th of the 14th, the moon is full of moons, bright moons will interfere with observations, so that the moon will fall in the middle of the night, and the radiation points of the bipolar meteor shower will rise.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the hours after midnight, but be careful to keep warm ... "
How can as many meteors as possible be observed?
"It is not recommended that observations be made in the city, that you choose a high altitude in the suburbs or in the countryside, that light be small, that the view in the northeast be open, and that you wait patiently until the moon falls, and that you see.
It's important to note that binary meteor showers flow in all directions, and they don't have to keep staring at the radiation points of the bingo meteor shower.
If a friend who likes photography is going to make a beautiful " meteor shower " , it's better to choose a wide angle, a big halo shot using high ISO and the largest halo.
For reasons of stability and continuity, tripods, back-up batteries and fast-door lines are also essential ... "

What are the differences in market positioning between laser and traditional television?
In my understanding, what the subject is referring to as traditional television is LCD, and the difference in market positioning between LCD and LCD is mainly the following:
First, laser TV is more focused on the big screen market.
Laser TV is clearly more focused on the big screen market than the full market position of LCD, or laser TV itself is the product of the big screen.
At present, mainstream LCD television is 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser TV is generally 75 inches or more, with a maximum of more than 100 inches, fully meeting user demand for large screen power.
In recent years, the share of global sales and sales of laser television has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of total television sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Mid-Ikang ' s projections, the market for laser television will grow by more than 140 per cent in 2020 and will continue to grow at a high rate.
The success in the big screen market is largely due to the performance of laser television in eye protection.
On the basis of laser television reflective imaging principles, laser light does not project directly into the eye, and the imaging process is closer to the image of an object under natural conditions and less stimulating to the eye than the LCD backlight.
Xersi Laboratory of the Chinese Institute for Standardization of Electronic Technology and ophthalmologist of the Beijing Institute for Standardization of Electronic Technology have produced 144 sets of test data through rigorous comparison tests of laser and LCD television under the same conditions as the population.
The data confirm that laser television does have a strong eye-protective feature and even a certain improvement in certain aspects.
In a time of increasing attention to the health of the eyes, laser television not only attracted more users with eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the coloured electricity market.
Second, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the downward trend in LCD prices, the current market prices for laser television are mostly over $10,000, and as size and light rises, prices rise.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
There's got to be a point.
With the constant development of light sources and technology, laser television has many advantages that neither LCD nor projection can achieve.
With ultra-focal-range projection technology, laser television is projected at a shorter distance than conventional projectors, capable of a 100-inch screen experience at short distances, requiring little space, and the mainframe is small, and the location is very small.
In brightness, big brand laser TV can reach more than 2,000.
With lower heat, low damage to equipment and longer life of television.
In addition to this, many high-end laser television models carry really 4K super-high-cleaning, artificial intelligence systems, imitation screens, and many cutting-edge technologies that can give users a more powerful audio-visual experience.
It's not a false demand, it's a product of a breakdown of needs, a comparison of quality and input output. Laser TV is not a sound player's dish. It's an inadequate screen and viewing environment. It can be tried, everything is good or bad.
Simply put, the hyperbolic near-focal projector, laser television, in order to get close to the screen, had to use expensive hyperbolic lenses and reflectors, which were not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield some of the environmental light, a microstructured Freel screen is expensive, with 80 inches worth about 65 inches of liquid crystal.
Also, I especially hate the idea that projectors are looking for this kind of spot for their eyes. Come on, the light on the screen that they can see is direct to their eyes, you're reflecting on the ceiling, you can't see it, you can't see it, you can't see it.
Besides, the projective screen would never have been like this if it hadn't been a perfunctory reflection.
It's just the hot spot effect of the high-growth screen, and it's hard to see a lot of light coming out of one angle.
There's no branch in the Opportunist Film and Visual Gallery.
With the date of the micro-letter appointment, my little sister sends me the choice of time, and the information is more timely.
Before I went to the shop, I saw the pictures, more of the outdoor wedding dress, they were beautiful, and they involved a lot of film styles.
After that day I had a brief exchange of ideas with my little sister, and I was very patient in trying out two of my tangled styles, and I was finally able to put up some props before the cameraman started filming, which would guide the movement and refine the details.
But maybe it wasn't my style because I didn't have a specific idea of filming, but it's supposed to be nice.
The photographer will help with the photo selection, communicate with later styles and feel very sensitive.
It's gonna take about half a month to fix it. Sit tight.
The second real-life king's dinner. Most of the clothes on the scene can choose one shot.
Finally, a black dress was chosen to experience different styles.
It takes about two hours, makeup plus, and the cameraman's younger brother after 95, and he's a little green, hoping to get more advice from the customer about the action.
Good Quality at the Visual Fine Arts Gallery. Response.
It's on the front page. Let's see Queenie too.
You fill in the phone number, you can choose the dress, you can choose the dress, you're patient with three or four costumes, you've been making up for a long time, you'll be very serviceful, and then you'll learn how to look, you'll have a big face, you'll have to write it for six months, three or four days.
[Environment] It's all right.
There's a lot of clothes to choose.
There's almost three make-up positions in the studio.
[Service] Very passionate and thoughtful.
The stylist is patient.
The photographer will teach you how to behave.
If you don't like it, the photographer will come forward with the re-shooting.
[Experience] Maybe it's a little too stylish. It's got three eyelids.
The browtails are shaved, and it's a little awkward for non-brows.
The pictures were given in ten days, but the P-charts didn't work very well, and it felt like it was still obvious.
Because I don't know what style it's gonna be, and I've tried two, and I've picked them out, and I've chosen a black dress.
The hairdresser and the make-up girl are so patient, they're very happy.
I started taking pictures when I got my makeup done, and the photographers were all over me, and it was easy and harmonious.
After the shoot, I carefully selected four of my favorites as a proficient, and my brother said it's 15 in a row, and it's a very happy ending.
No reply has been received since 3 days ... I cannot join the #PRS_ORG#plus monthly fee program because your system is unable to identify my credit card!
The strangest thing is, I use the same credit card every time I make a payment.
I have to pay the freight every time.
I'll be excused until you've finished your investigation and charge me my monthly fee. Is that okay?
A little umbrella for insurance. What's the point?
A small umbrella is an Internet insurance broker platform.
In terms of conditionality: three key words must be met to become an insurance broker, as suggested by the Regulation on the Regulation of Insurance Brokering Agencies (Revised 2015): shareholders, sponsors, for the last three years, have no significant legal record and a minimum limit of 50 million yuan can be established, subject to the consent of the China Insurance Supervisory Board.
These three are really tough, and they're all about strength, with the approval of the State authority of the Silver Insurance Supervisory Board (which regulates insurance companies throughout the country, banks), and good behaviour on the part of shareholders. As small umbrellas for insurance brokers, the insurers don't have to question too much about the formality of umbrellas, after all, these three thresholds, which are not all insurance companies.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products: Umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star risk is sold on this platform, such as the most recent one on board and the Thai Super Mary Five. The claimants and insurers are like Thais. The Umbrella insurance is just a third-party broker.
In terms of the contribution model: Internet platform products, because of the cost of operating the site and the cost of the operator ' s salary, have a higher universal value than Internet products, with flexible payment modalities that support monthly payments and reduce the burden on contributors while maximizing leverage to leverage insurance.
That's very good.
You can think about it.
This is particularly important in terms of the professional level of the operator, since insurance is a highly specialized industry in which many customers of Internet products can insure themselves, and there are many errors. In the area of health notification and employment, non-insured workers often add their own subjective sense of health or compatibility to the insurance policy, so that there is a risk that they may be denied compensation.
I've been in insurance phone sales myself, and I'm very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is real, it's solid, it's not human, it's not professional, it's a lot of misleading sales.
For example: $6 million for insurance, $6 million for insurance and a mobile phone, $60,000 for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they're easy to avoid, and they don't tell the insured. First month, the next month is a normal charge. Dozens to 200, and many customers pay their own fees for a year or two.
Thought it'd cost a dollar and the insurance company would pay $6 million.
Free cell phones are delivered by the end of the policy number 6666,88888, a special policy section, and if the winning text is sent, it doesn't convert itself or be reminded.
It's a short term, if it's on this one, without any other commercial insurance, if it's serious, if it's serious, what's 60,000, if it doesn't solve the problem, and then life starts to run naked.
The State is also taking a heavy toll on the misdirection of Internet insurance sales.
So on balance, there's no problem with the platform, there's no problem with the product, and there's no problem with the professional and professional integrity of the operator.
It is recommended that the subject matter be considered carefully and that, in fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, more opportunities and products to be chosen by their customers, and that some products have a better value than Internet products.
I've helped 59 Internet clients on my own, insured under the line and saved 2000-3000 a year for each of them.
If you have any questions, you are welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
I: Mingya Insurance Broker, who has three years of experience in business management training, has served nearly a thousand business users, has worked with more than 100 insurance companies. Before I insure, I customize the insurance products for customers, and in this case, I offer to three customers the best possible insurance results for customers. After I insure, I make insurance policies for customers, hold them, and keep them safe.
Growing up with every client for life.
I hope my answer will help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulator, Internet insurance is an insurance operation in which an insured person can independently complete all insurance processes by clicking on the insurance link.
During this process, the insured person does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be carried out by the insured person alone.
Although Internet insurance coverage is not so "ceremonial" and may not even exist in hard copy paper contracts, it does not in any way affect the validity or legal validity of electronic contracts.
It's kind of like a "telephone sales" streaming operation, but there's also a fatal problem with insurance, which is that the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a decades-long long-term contract, and should we seriously think about this "intermediate" that we've chosen, is it an "insurer" who can be with us for a long time, and who will serve us for many years?

Just get back the preferential code.
No problem. Don't have to arrange a re-delivery. I've bought another one. I don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of insult or verbal abuse, much less such physical assault.
In civilized society, we can embrace everything, but it's about putting an end to such villains.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it's this uncivilistic way to resist first.
I've been indifferent since you started sending Facebook and friends requests, and then you put up ads, and then you tried to put my home and father's name on social media.
You're not just going to eat six meals a day, you're going to go on to me, and I'm going on Facebook with your so-called friends talking about my cover, humiliation, appearance, body, living, what bed-breathing strawberries, whatever messages I want to put in, and I'm not gonna do it.
I don't know if I've received more statements from a number of friends about your Facebook friend's account with a picture of you and a sexual harassment component.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't keep my silence any longer.
When I uploaded the news to the police, you didn't stop at all, but you became more aggressive.
I don't care what your political background is, whatever your status is, in our society, it requires respect from both sexes.
Yes, you can go on with this tactful, subtle, humiliating, abusive talk, and you can go on saying that you're just caring and watching me, and you can continue to think that it's not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it's not your picture or continue to make all offensive statements.
Yes, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I don't know you. I don't want to know you. I don't need your opinion on my face and body.
I don't even think there's a girl who's willing to let someone else humiliate herself in exchange for fame.
Friends ask me, how are you?
I said yes, you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay when she's so bullied.
In the workplace, in society, in politics or in business, only those who have no basic virtues will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe in justice.
I intercepted some of the messages for comment.
I don't think anyone can pretend to be you with your own post.
All I can say is that you're an enemy of civilization.
He smiles.

Xinhua Network (Xinhua Network)
The Xinhua Society Wuhan electric (journalist Wang Xian) became operational on December 11th in Chongqing City on the 10th of December, the second water green integrated service area to be officially operational in the upper Yangtze province, following the inauguration of the Green Water Integrated Service Area in Sichuan Province on December 8th.
By that time, the water-green integrated service area covered the Yangtze, medium and downstream.
The Deputy Director-General of the Jiang Aviation Authority of the Ministry of Transport and Transport, Qiu Jianhua, said that earlier, the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu had been located in the middle of the Yangtze River and 10 integrated water-based green service areas had been built downstream, and had been recognized by a large number of crews, which had played an important role in promoting quality development in the Yangtze shipping industry.
The full coverage of the water-based green integrated service area is another milestone in the construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River, where the pollution of ships is received and the capacity of shipping services is significantly enhanced.
It was described that the green and integrated water service area was an important facility for providing full range of production and life services to ships and crews and helping them to solve their "worst-and-waiting" problems.
The construction of two operational water-based integrated service areas in the upper Yangtze, combining life, production and government services, with the theme of green environment, with the emphasis on ship repair and emergency ship rescue services, and the realization of "one call, multiple services " in the port, will make the crews who have been sailing in the Yangtze for many years more efficient and easier to live.
The American Trinity Carrier has rarely visited Guam with the most powerful weapons around China, 2022-01-17 Do-D, pro-CCP media multidimensional coverage: the latest news on Chinese-American relations: the latest satellite images show that three American carriers are gathering around China; the US Media has also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the United States Navy arsenal rarely visits Guam, sending important signals to American allies and opponents in the Indian Territory.
According to the Chinese think tank, the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, on 9 January, a satellite found the USS Carl Vincent carrier near the Balabak Channel.
The Parabak Strait, with its link to the South and Sulu Seas, is a strategic location in the chain of the First Island of the Western Pacific.
The platform anticipates that the Carl Vincent will be deployed to the South Sea.
This is the first time that the Carl Vincent carrier has been deployed on board F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 fishhawk carriers.
The American carrier, now up in the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the Carl Vincent, and the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier, who left the United States on January 3rd.
Lincoln was also on board the F-35C squadron for the first time, and the squadron of the 314th United States Marines attacked squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the United States Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan carrier docked in Japan.
The carrier battles also included the Shempland missile cruiser, the Stokdar missile destroyer, etc.
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform released the latest satellite images showing that three American carriers were gathering around China.
U.S. three carriers gathered around China's most powerful weapons and rarely visited Guam on January 17, 2022, on the flight route of U.S. military carrier CMV-22B.
Also reported by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the United States Navy arsenal rarely visited Guam last weekend.
The Ohio class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, with 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the United States Navy base on Guam last Saturday, January 15.
The American three carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam, an analysis that sent a signal to their allies and enemies in an increasingly tense situation in the India-Pacific region.
This was the first visit to Guam by a United States ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
American carriers have gathered the most powerful weapons around China and have rarely visited Guam. China has built a large number of military installations in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
This is the Chinese island of Yongchun in the Nansha Islands.
In its statement, the United States Navy stated that the visit of the Ohio class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam had enhanced cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating American capabilities, flexibility, operational readiness and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly known as Boomer submarine.
The whereabouts of the 14 thunder submarines in the U.S. Navy are usually strictly classified.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make the thundering submarines the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad. This system also includes silo ballistic missiles located on American soil, as well as bombers with nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Talked to friends about the recent 26% decline in Meta, the evaporation of the market value, $251 billion, and Zuckerberg responded "in the face of unprecedented competition," why?
Meta is essentially an advertising company, with revenue derived mainly from advertising, and today's commercial companies that make money have their own channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., whatever the function is, it's Meta's channel.
Not only that, but Meta is also the biggest ad alliance, and a lot of app ads go out to Meta, through Meta's advertising platform to make it happen.
But times have changed.
First, due to Apple privacy policy changes, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's privacy policy is now very user-friendly, and it's obvious that the user will not allow App to access his own information, and most people's normal reaction is certainly not.
Next thing you know, there's a bigger impact on Meta's income if Google stabs one more time.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's income growth has weakened.
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but that's not an accurate understanding.
Every year, Meta earns at least 10 per cent of its income from China, mainly from China's maritime companies.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is a few hundred people, and there's a few big agencies on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their markets abroad, Meta.
Interestingly, the byte TT is one of Meta's main competitors, but the last two years Meta could make a lot of money on the byte.
All the agents in the country are going to Meta's place for ads, and Meta's great performance in China.
I haven't been special about it lately, but I'm sure it won't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale offshore burning of money by Chinese companies is over.
Third, new traffic channels are not expanding well.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not only at middle income, but more importantly at what is expected in the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg said, "The Woncosmos."
The meta-cosm should be one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of the meta-cosmos is longer, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So in the next two years, it's gonna be a tough time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now, with $100 billion to $200 billion a year in income, but it's actually very dangerous, and there's no safe moat compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although some of his social software is now high on a daily basis and mainstream social software such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has little confidence in the rapid development of tiktok, and subversion is a blinking effort.
And the impossible concept of a metaspace, with no prospect of success in a short period of time, makes Facebook very dangerous, and that is why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for a new track, but I think his track is wrong, and it's a non-return route, and that's some of my thoughts, for information.
