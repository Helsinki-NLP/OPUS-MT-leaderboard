The report published by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 26 February states that Iran has begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, in further violation of the nuclear agreement reached with the world ' s major Powers in 2015.
According to the IAEA report, the advanced centrifuges at the Iranian Nattanz Nuclear Facility are "accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium."
Since United States President Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear agreement with the major Powers.
The agreement states that Iran can only extract uranium from the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges ...
The other signatories to this agreement, the United Kingdom, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to save it, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to the Japan Joint News Agency, in the afternoon of 25 local time, Japan ' s Foreign Minister Moo-gi held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, where he visited, confirming that the conclusion of peace treaty negotiations covering the territory of the four northern islands (the disputed islands of Russia and Russia, known as the " four northern islands " , and Russia as the " South Korean islands " ) would be advanced, that relations between the two countries would be developed in a wide range of political, economic and other areas, and that agreement had been reached to coordinate the early visit of the two sides to Russia.
This was the first consultation with Russia as the head of the peace treaty negotiations since he took office as Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Maori expressed to the Russian side that " including the promotion of joint economic activities (on the northern islands) in the hope of effective consultation " .
According to the Government of Japan, the talks did not discuss the Territory in detail.
At the Russian summit meeting in December 2018, it was confirmed that the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, in their capacity as heads of State, should expedite the negotiations.
At the meeting, the Foreign Ministers of the two countries welcomed the progress made in the consultations on joint economic activities in the field of tourism, waste disposal ...

The women's platoon is expected to champion the World Cup ahead of time!
On 27th, in a match against the Dutch women's platoon, the Chinese team was brought back to the city by the rivals after winning two games, and finally won nine in a row at 3:1 o'lek.
The game of the World Cup is nearing its end, but in the face of the Serbian team, the Chinese women's platoon must not be taken lightly.
In the first two rounds of the game with the Netherlands, the Chinese women's platoons were as strong as ever. They went down two cities at 25:19, 25:16, until the third.
The Dutch women's platoon has increased the aggressiveness of their serve while they are lagging behind, and the Chinese team has been hit, and the girls are attacking, and the mistakes are beginning to increase, and the enemy has finally taken it back to the city at 21:25.
In an interview, Xijiang Ping also pointed out: " In the third round, we sent about eight points because of a mistake... "
Of course, the Dutch women's platoons were in the wrong, and the Chinese women's rows were hard prepared before the race, but they lost a game, but everything was still in Lamping's hands. " It's normal to win the game with the strong, it's normal to win the game, it's normal to win the game five, so we said to the players, " [Lang Ping] said so.
In the fourth round, the players are actively adjusting, Zhang Changning is firing at the attack, the single game is eight points, and he's doing his best for the team.
So far, 11 rounds of confrontation have left only two rounds, and while one hand has touched the championship, in the match against the Dutch team, the Chinese women have indeed been warned: the more critical the moment, the harder the effort will be.
In another game on 27th, the Russian and American women's rows were filled with five games, and the American team failed to score all three points from their opponents.
Everything is moving towards a situation favourable to Chinese women.
However, while Serbia's six majors are in short supply, this does not mean that they will give three cents to the Chinese team.
In the current form of the scoreboard, the Serbian team has virtually lost its mark, which means that they can "put in light" in the fight against Chinese women, drop their loads and hit their opponents with full force, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win, and the situation is likely to rise and fall.
Moreover, the replacement Serbian team was not the lamb of the "sculpture", as evidenced by the depth of its thickness when it was finally reversed by the Serbian 2nd team in the 5th round of the war with the Netherlands.
Before the third phase of the game, Luang Ping also said that neither team was easy to deal with: " The match in Osaka will be very difficult, and we have to prepare carefully, as always... "
Now that the horns of the crown have been blown, the game has really entered the white heat phase.
In terms of strength, the Chinese women are above their opponents, but only at the last minute, and it is up to the girls to be able to do their best to free themselves in the race.

On September 24th, "a boat ticket to show me "The Love Helper" was held on the head of Changsha, where more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to the Orange Star Cruise to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Most of the more than 100 disabled people who attended this event were boarded for the first time on a cruise ship.
Zhao Zhengang, 56 years old, is a crippled man, and usually rarely leaves the house because his feet are difficult to move.
He said, " For the first time today, I'm on a cruise ship, and I'm close to the vastness of the Gang, and I'm very excited about the development pulse of Sha, and I can't forget it... "
Volunteers from the Fukuoka Social Work Centre and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha City have provided sophisticated services to the disabled.
Especially for those with severe physical disabilities, volunteers will carry them up and down the liner.
According to the head of the Fukuoka Social Work Centre, over the past 70 years, with the support of the party and the Government, the cause of persons with disabilities in Changsha City has continued to evolve, with an increasing number of persons with disabilities becoming real participants in socio-economic development, contributors and beneficiaries, caring for and assisting persons with disabilities, and caring for and supporting the cause of persons with disabilities becoming a social consensus.
The Republic is about to celebrate its seventieth anniversary, and the spotlights of the media on all roads are glittering and glowing -- they are the ones who bring heat and light to our bright days, silk glitters...
However, if a hero walks around, it looks like you're just like me.
Yuan Yongping, a deep-seated rice researcher, has produced good seeds to feed the world, leaving a billion people at risk of hunger and loss of credit, and is also like an old farmer who likes to grow up in the fields; Nan In-dong, the chief scientist who is so eager to make China's eyes go up, who is a man, who spends a lifetime, a pot, doing one thing, eating cold buns in a deep mountain in Guizhou, who has nothing to do with the old man in the nest; Zhou Chang, a red scientist, a village boy who is so late in his life, who is still like a red son, who learns in the middle and west, and who talks about his heart, who likes to laugh; Qin-yun, a half-day movie artist who, after 90 years of age, and who is happy to be an unknown old maid in the middle of his day in the Highlands...
They seek to live simple, pure and committed, so long as they are immersed in the unease of the outsiders and their own treasures, it is easy for them to be happy, not in the name, not in the name, but in the glory.
Just like Kim's novel, Shaolin Temple hides a shattering monk in the courthouse, who has no joy, no joy and no sorrow.
Every Monk, every son of a bitch, has a place behind his back that belongs to me.
My country is not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hearts of millions of people.
Once upon a time, a girl in high school was turned on by her Internet friends, " When a hero passes, someone has to sit by the side of the road and applaud... and I don't want to be a hero, I want to be a person sitting by the side of the road... "
Actually, it's not a contradiction to be a hero and to applaud a hero.
The people on the side of the road are also passing heat and light, and they're also glowing.
As you are me, there are opportunities, moments, days and months, and forms of hero.
A fine judge in Shanghai, Zoo Beihua, who took the responsibility of judicial reform, put on stage his story at the annual conference, sent numerous newspaper letters a year, never wrong, " doing the simple thing right is not simple " , and Zau Beihua led the judges to give a round of applause to this old "scrubbing monk" message.
It's between heroes. A hero applauds another hero.
Shaolin temples are hidden in the temple, Yuan Longping has a vast rice field, Nan Indong has the Eye of Heaven, Qin Yi has the stage and Zhou Chang has the platform to be a hero, not only on his own, but also a good environment and a positive incentive mechanism.
China SkyEye, for example, is now a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese scientific community was struggling to climb the slopes, and the novelist Liu Xi Xin has yet to write "The Three."
The greatest eye at that time was the single-gauge radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico Island — Arecibo, 350 meters in diameter, considered the largest in a world that could not be overridden.
The Chinese radio telescope at that time was less than one tenth in diameter.
But Nan In-dong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home with an almost insane idea: to build a new generation of radio " Large Telescopes " in China, to receive more messages from outer space!
China's got a lot of money to play with the stars?
The motherland trusted Nan In-dong, and the "Eye of Heaven" project began.
It's been 12 years. It's been nine years since it was set.
The 500-metre SkyEye opened, and China became an unprecedented nation, "The world 's unique scientific engineering " .
So, SkyEye is great, the Nan Indongs are great, they're big, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they're great, they'
With the trust of the nation, the goodwill of the people, the opportunity for the Nan Indongs to become the people of the nation.
It's nice and harmonious to have a young man, a white-haired hero walking by, a country where people applaud lightly on the side of the road.
Garbage classification education begins at Gilling kindergarten, and environmentalism begins with dolls.
On 27th, a kindergarten in Gilling City, Jilin Province, conducted a garbage classification education course to teach young children how to distinguish recyclable waste from other types of waste.
It is known that this is the first time that garbage is classified into a local early childhood education class.
Today, the nine departments of Jilin jointly launched a programme of work to promote the classification of waste in urban life at the local level in Jilin.
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot of the compulsory classification of household waste in Changchun City, the province decided to carry out the classification of household waste in local cities.
Gilling City is one of them.
Through this event, we hope to achieve a child-led family, a kindergarten-led society, and an environment-friendly concept.
Yoo Li-jun, the executive director of Fan International Kindergarten, said the event.
On the same day, the director read out an environmental initiative, hoping that garbage would start with the children.
After the low-carbon bell dance, the kids grouped up and made a little garbage sorting game.
The tutor also issued the "Recoverable Other Garbage" label and advised the children to stick the label on the trash when they came home and make small videos.
Liu Lilong explained that the kindergarten has been promoting low-carbon, green and environmentally friendly concepts, and has regularly opened environmental syllables.
There's also a classible trash can at the dump in the park, which is marked with the type of drop.
Teacher taught the kids what recycling garbage is.
According to preliminary statistics, in 2018 in Jilin province, the amount of waste generated in urban areas was approximately 54,652 million tons, all of which went to the waste disposal yard for disposal.
Of this total, 32.92 million tons were landfilled in sanitary conditions, 2,092 million tons were burned and 80.1 million tons were treated using integrated processes.
After many years of efforts, the province ' s municipalities and counties have the capacity to treat the waste of their lives in a non-hazardous manner.
In the programme to promote the classification and disposal of waste in local cities in Jilin province, which has been launched, it is explicitly requested that activities such as garbage collection in schools, textbooks, classrooms, etc., enhance interaction between students and parents by creating garbage sorting songs, songs, cartoons, microvideos, etc., with the effect of "pedagogizing a child, influencing a family, bringing a community, raising a new generation."
According to data released on September 27th, Maedeta's global sales in August were 117,015.
Sales in China declined by 21 per cent due to the impact of underinvestment of new vehicles and reduced prices.
Japan’s domestic sales fell by 6%, and the demand for the last bus before the consumption tax hike in October was limited.
In August, Majeta sold 17729 vehicles in China.
August 2018 was also 13% lower than the previous year, and sales continued to decline.
China 's dedicated main SUV "CX-4" sales have decreased by 14%.
"CX-4" has been on the market for a long time since 2016, and the effect of the new car has declined.
Reductions in prices as a result of strategies to raise brand value from a long-term perspective are also known to have a significant impact on sales.
Majeta's sales in the United States grew by 7 per cent on a year-on-year basis, reaching 27482 and growing 14 months later.
In August, the salesman's business days were one more day than in the previous year, and the promotion of publicity and other promotional activities (Majeda) led to an increase in sales of SUV "CX-5".
Japanese domestic sales fell by 6%, to 14422.
According to the company, "Emergency purchases before tax increases" are not as high as they were in the last time (2014).
The sales of cars like "Demio" have been reduced.
The death of Chirac and the perpetuation of the political legacy.
On the 26th of local time, former French President Chirac passed away and was 86 years old.
At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of great change, the political legacy of the French politician who came to power in that year is still worthy of our praise.
He was President of France for 12 years in a very personal way.
He has inherited the diplomatic spirit of de Gaulle independence and a strong support for European integration, representing the pursuit of the European Dream.
At the same time, he is a strategic statesman, a strong advocate of multipolarity and multilateralism in the world.
That's why the French media said he was "France's distinguished representative on the world stage."
One of the promising political decisions of Chirac is to oppose the American-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France, together with Germany, stood up to the pressure of the United States and was in the forefront of the war.
A year after the war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an increase in terrorist activity and make the world more dangerous.
Later on, it turns out that Chirac's warning was quite correct.
At a time when European integration is stifling, when unilateralism in the United States is becoming more pronounced, and the way forward, Chirac ' s strategic thinking and choices about international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly highly instructive.
Chirac is also a French politician who is familiar and friendly to the Chinese.
He was one of the protagonists and creators of the Golden Decade of China-France relations, which, after being elected President of France for the first time in 1995, was driven by the statesman's strategic vision.
In 2004, China established a comprehensive strategic partnership and China entered a new phase of bilateral contacts.
During Chirac, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and cooperation between the two countries in various fields, such as aviation, nuclear power and rail transport, made breakthrough progress.
The Meso-French Cultural Year of the Chirac Initiative created a completely new model of cultural exchange in the history of China.
Chirac's life has been particularly impressive for Chinese culture.
It is known to his Chinese diplomats that Chirac can carry Li Bai, some poems by Du Prey, and even accurately judge the history of China's bronze apparatus.
"It's not true that the pyramid came to Egypt, it's not true that the Qin came to China." – This phrase comes from Chirac.
In an interview with a Xinhua journalist, Chirac said: " The West is concerned about China ' s political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China ' s economic growth, and China ' s political status at the international level ...
But I have confidence in China myself.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization whose experience is sufficient to help it build ideas and values for harmonious development and to shoulder its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time ... "
I also believe that the revival of China will bring new creativity to the world culture and enrich it.
The people have gone, but the political legacy and inspiration that Chirac left to the world will survive.

Members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have joined forces against the United States-related Hong Kong Bill.
In a joint statement issued on 27 July by some members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR, a strong opposition was expressed to the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 by the Foreign Council of both Houses of Congress of the United States Congress.
This statement, which was co-sponsored by 40 formed members of Parliament, states that Hong Kong's rights are currently conferred by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including the maintenance of free trade ports and separate customs areas, the conclusion and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements in various fields, such as the economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sports, etc., in the name of Hong Kong, China, in cooperation and the development of relations with different countries and regions of the world.

Hong Kong has always been highly committed to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, engaged in business with different countries and regions, and engaged in a wide range of related areas of cooperation.
The statement states that the adoption of the bill by the United States Senate and the Foreign Affairs Committee is not necessary, but rather as a means of responding to the calls of its agents in Hong Kong to intervene violently in Hong Kong ' s internal affairs and to seek political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong.
The formed council members deeply regret this move by the United States and strongly oppose it.
The statement states that Hong Kong is an important trading partner and the largest source of trade surplus for the United States ...
The good rule of law in Hong Kong, a fair and free business environment, a clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to run business.
If the United States passed this bill, it would have further aggravated the relationship between China and the United States without any benefit or harm to others, in addition to attacking Hong Kong and the United States itself.
The statement states that Hong Kong will remain steadfast in its implementation of the "one country, two systems" approach and will continue to enjoy the rights enshrined in the Basic Law and fulfil its obligations effectively.
In the past, now and in the future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international commerce.
According to the 26th of the European Times, the two chambers of the French Parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
The French President, Markron, recently claimed that France was unable to "take everyone " , but at the same time it was trying to "better accept " .
According to reports, Markron is trying to find a compromise route in immigration matters to mitigate the impact of the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview in New York, United States, during the general debate of the General Assembly, Markron expressed the hope that there would be a real "two-pronged" approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Markron said: " If France wishes to be properly admitted (immigrants), it cannot accept everyone " .
Markron identified four priorities for immigration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; more efficient integration of migrants; reception and protection of all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of those who have entered France illegally and are not fit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the AME system was the most discussed topic in the past.
Markron said he wanted to be able to "evaluate" the system, but not to eliminate it, but to limit it to a certain extent.
After Markron made this statement, the extreme right-wing leader of the National Union, Le Pompey, wrote that Markron's expression was "no talk."
The President of the Senate, Rasher, who is a member of the right Republican party, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "modest" but "counter reality" way, indirectly criticizing Markron.
Congressman Valau of the Left Socialist Party believes that, with regard to immigration, France should "take more and better " , and criticize Markron for "wiping" the subject.
Reports indicate that the new version of the Law on Asylum and Immigration has been in place for one year and that it has led to differences of opinion within the ruling party, but at the same time it has not been possible to appease the right-wing opposition.
In the next general election in 2022, the topic of immigration policy will again be the focus of an extreme right-wing attack, and Markron will need to do something about it, but at the same time he will run the risk of inflaming left-wing elements within the ruling party.
It has been reported that the lower house of the French National Assembly will start a debate on immigration policy on 30 September and the Senate on 2 October.
There are indications that China A shares are back on the "buy back " and that many listed companies are buying back real silver.
According to statistics on Eastern wealth of financial data service providers, in 2019, the total amount of repurchases by A-listed companies had exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, RM), far higher than the figures for the same period in previous years, and the amount of repurchases by A-stocks had been historically high.
In response, Xuyang, Chairman of McCoron Information Consulting Limited, Shanghai, stated that the overall value of the A share market this year was low and that the repurchase of shares at relatively low prices was conducive to more efficient use of funds by listed companies, as well as to the willingness of listed companies to manage market value and cash flows, and to boost investor confidence.
In addition, a well-developed equity buy-back system has encouraged listed companies to actively engage in stock buy-backs.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued regulations for the repurchase of shares by listed companies, providing detailed regulations and guidelines for repurchase of shares by listed companies.
Also according to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented an increased buy-back programme have been concentrated in the capital sector, the real estate sector, the information technology industry and the electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, in terms of repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased more than $1 billion this year.
The first of these is the Ily shares, which buys back more than $5 billion.
What is the impact of stock buy-backs by listed companies on the market?
In an interview with a Chinese News Agency journalist, the Vice-President of the Financial and Financial Institute of the People ' s University of China, Zhao Si Jun, stated that repurchases showed, on the one hand, that listed companies had a stronger economic power and a better financial position and were capable of maintaining stable stock prices and giving confidence to investors, and, on the other hand, that listed companies and their controlling shareholders were accountable to companies, to markets and to investors.
The former is based on good corporate performance, while the latter requires a high quality of listed companies and their controlling shareholders.
For capital markets, it's the core building block.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies can boost investor confidence and support stock prices in listed companies.
Also according to the Eastern Securities Research report, based on the expected stock buybacks from A stock listings as a whole since the beginning of this year, and on the average value of the stock that has been repurchased, this year ' s stock buy-back is expected to bring up over $150 billion in incremental capital to the A stock market.
For almost two months, the National Focus Unit's major mural painting of the Queens after Tianjin was completed on 26th, and will be reopened during this year's National Day.
"The Queen's Book" is a big mural that reflects Mother's whole life.
With the approval of the relevant State authorities, it was drawn by the Director of the former Tianjin Museum of Civility (the Queen's Palace) from 1991 to 1994.
It is known that this mural was painted south of the palace, full 32 metres long and 2.6 metres tall on the north wall, with the birth of the queen, the sea crossing, the feathering of the sky and more than 30 stories, and 358 people rediscovering the life of their mother.
Chai Chang-kyu explained that in recent years, the summer rains in Tianjin and the dry winters caused the mural to break up, which accounted for 60 per cent of the total mural area.
In order to protect and save Mother's family's murals, the Council of Antiquities Streets and the Palace of Queens started work on the restoration of murals in the Queen's Palace and its interiors in the south of Tianjin City.
The restoration project was led by Choi Chang-kyu and involved four prominent national painters.
The restoration work was based on the principle of `renovation as old as old', with partial adaptation of the original mural and supplementation of the area where the mural was not perfect.
In the process of repair, we have also made innovations and attempts in colours, materials, pen ink, etc.
After repair, the original fresco looks, spirituality, spirituality and art style were preserved.
The Palace of Queens was built in 1326 and is known as the Queen's Palace. It has been repaired several times. It is one of the oldest buildings in the city of Tianjin and one of the oldest temples in China.
On September 25th, the launch ceremony of the Beijing Daesing International Airport took place.
The model of the Beijing Da-Hing International Airport terminal, "The Phoenix has shown its wings" is the first of the seven wonders of the new world.
Beijing Capital International Airport is currently overstretched, with 100 million passengers transported last year, becoming the second year of the world after Atlanta Airport in the United States of America, where passengers have swallowed hundreds of millions of times.
By 2022, it is expected that 45 million passengers and 20 per cent of international flights will have swallowed up by Beijing Daes International Airport; 72 million passengers will have swallowed up by 2025, and 30 per cent of international flights are expected to have eaten by 2025.
How cool is it as the New Kingdom door?
Beijing Dae-hing International Airport is located between Beijing City and Guangyang District of Hebei Province. It is 46 km from the Tiananmen Gate, the largest new airport to be built around the world.
The surface projection of the steel structure on the roof of its terminal amounted to 180,000 square metres, with 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daesing International Airport is the world's first terminal with two levels of arrival and two levels of departure — F1-F4 international, domestic, domestic and international.
Two-storey bridges connecting the high-speed and the airport outside the terminal, corresponding to the F3, F4 terminal — international departures to the floors and domestic departures to the two floors.
The first voyage of Beijing Dae-hung International Airport opened the era of Beijing's Twin Airports.
The new airport has been established as a major international aviation hub, and the country has developed new power sources to support the Kyoto regional integrated transport hub built in the Yu AnZin district. To date, a total of 66 airlines are interested in entering Dahin International Airport in Beijing, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 Hong Kong, Adota and foreign airlines whose flights are approved at any given time.
During the winter and spring season of 2019, Beijing Daesing International Airport was expected to open 116 routes, of which 101 were internal and 15 were international; it covered 112 points worldwide, including 97 national and 15 international.
This has resulted in a coordinated development with the Beijing Capital International Airport, with a moderate level of competition and a "two-hub" airport configuration with international first-rate competitiveness, which has eased the pressure on the capital's airport to operate with saturated capacity and better met the urgent need for rapid growth in air transport in Beijing and the surrounding region and has effectively enhanced the international competitiveness of our civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daesing International Airport takes due account of its geographical location, its relationship to the surrounding airspace and operating environment. For the first time in the country, the airport runways have adopted a "all-way" layout, the world's largest air traffic control system, and China's largest terminal control area has been established, which maximizes the efficiency of aviation operations.
For the first time, airports of this size in the country use nationalized baggage processing and information management systems, using innovative baggage transfer models to improve the efficiency of luggage processing.
It's the first flight of Da Hing International Airport in Beijing. It's a sign that Phoenix is flying.
This new airport, which has created more than 40 international, national and national production rates of more than 98 per cent, is bound to have a direct and indirect economic impact on the surrounding industries and to inject the energy into the development of the Beijing economy.
Marv is scheduled to convene a congress in November to transfer to the Party until the age of 16.
Marv is tentatively scheduled to convene a central congress in early November to change the party's age of transfer under the party charter until the age of 16.
With Congress passing down the voting age for general elections, Mawar announced the 66th Central Congress this year, proposing amendments to the party charter, including a downward adjustment to the membership age of Mawar from the current age of 18 to 16.
The General President of Ma Wah, Mr. Datos Li Xiang, said that the Central Committee had been scheduled to hold a central congress on 2 and 3 November this year, but that the date of the congress might change as a result of the by-election to the Danish seat.
He said that, since the Election Commission would meet on 1 October to finalize the nomination of the Danfumi-Ai by-election and the voting date, they would meet the following day, 2 October, to discuss whether to change the date of this year ' s Central Congress.
He also explained that the purpose of the Central Committee convened yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the congress and to amend the party's statutes, but only to coincide with the tragic death of Congressman Danfung of the Indigenous Unity Party (IUP) and of Congressman Mohamud, and thus join the agenda of the national by-elections.
Xinhua Network
Wang Guoxiang, born in February 1943, worked in 1967 and served successively as secretary of the Commune Party, county secretary, mayor, etc.
In 1986, Wang was the secretary of the county council of Shandong Province, when his life was a poor county in the province.
During his five years in office, Mr. Wang focused his efforts on three things: promoting the industrialization of vegetables; developing a salty salt beach; and laying the foundation for an industrial turn-up, which led to the emergence of a pocket and a waistboard.
Life farmers have a tradition of vegetables, and they've learned how to grow vegetables.
At the beginning of the 1980s, life farmers couldn't sell their harvests and rot in the ground.
Wang Bo-xiang found that the key to catching vegetables is to make it flow.
Lifelight was the first to set up a wholesale market for vegetables and set the stage for the development of a market economy.
Party cadres take the lead. They fuck up. They're all in the county.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Bo-xiang, 17 members of the three-dollar village, Lo-yee, built 17 warm winter vegetables sheds, and 17 " double-million-dollar households " emerged from the village.
Then a promotion group was set up in the county, which, with the mobilization of Wang Bo-xiang, directed Wang Lo-yi to the countryside; more than 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted in the first year, and the vegetable sheds moved to the county and to the whole country.
For hundreds of years, 1.6 million acres of land were painted on shallow beaches in addition to saline beaches.
The local crowd is living very hard.
Soo Nam's got a vegetable shed. What about Subei?
Wang Bo-xiang organized a battle for a hundred thousand people to set up camp on the desolate beach for 40 or 50 days.
Wang Bo-xiang and the county's leaders lived on the site, pushing cars and carrying loads like private workers, and living in a place where the people saw them stretching their thumbs, admiring their eyes... ...when Subei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a "pore pot" on salty beaches.
In July 1986, Wang Bo-xiang participated for the first time as county secretary in the industrial conference of the city of Yuya in his capacity as district secretary.
During the meeting, a table comparing industrial economy figures in the 12th Prefectural District of Kwanya was released, and at first glance the gross industrial output is still in its fourth place.
But if we take the salt out, we'll have $119 million of pure industrial output left in the last three.
Wang's 70-plus men have gone out of town to change their minds.
Less than a year back, the county invested $150 million in 77 projects.
Every year since then, we've organized the ETA, to Shenzhen, Togashi and Shanghai.
Life is short of businesses, even short of entrepreneurs.
Wang Bo-xiang presided over a special session: the public selection of the director of the factory across the county, with 40 talented people out of business, was pushed to the industry line.
In 1991, he joined the nation's 100-thousand counties, and Wang Bo-xiang was transferred as Deputy Mayor of the city.
He left over 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4854 businesses, more than 100,000 " 10,000 households " , a cadre recognized by the people.
On 26 September, local time, the Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi presided over the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African States members of the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The meeting was attended by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Côte d ' Ivoire, which is currently a member of the Security Council in Africa, Oyono, Equatorial Guinea, Pandor, South Africa, and Kara, Niger, which is a member-designate of the Council, and Jesinawi, Tunisia.
Wang Yi made four proposals to strengthen cooperation between the two sides in the Council.
First of all, it's the strength of unity.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, the direct consequence of which is the challenge to the basic norms of international relations and the impact on the role of the United Nations, to the detriment of the interests of the developing countries in general and the small and medium-sized countries in particular, including the African countries.
To meet this challenge, it takes hands and arms to unite.
In this Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, and the focus is not just three votes, but the continent as a whole.
China and Africa stand together, not just four votes, but will lead others to follow, influence and shape the agenda of the Council.
Since 2018, China has established a 3+1 coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, which should be fully utilized.
Secondly, we need to negotiate a solution to the dispute.
China has always advocated a political solution to hotspot issues. Africa has a good tradition of consultation, as well as the experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex and difficult issues on the Council ' s agenda, in particular hot spots in Africa, are largely rooted in colonialism and in some cases directly related to external factors.
We need to work together on Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and on the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation, etc.
Third, self-inflicted.
African countries and peoples know best about Africa ' s problems, and Africa has the capacity and the wisdom to solve its own problems.
In dealing with hot spots in Africa, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa ' s will, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa ...
China stands ready to strengthen coordination with the African side and to contribute firmly to capacity-building for African-owned peace operations.
And fourthly, it's basic to development.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we will insist on putting economic and social development first and supporting each other in their chosen path of development.
China is ready to build a "one-way" with the AU Agenda 2063, the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030, which is closely aligned with the development strategies of African countries, and to help African countries to strengthen their capacity for development and address the root causes of conflict.
Together, we will push the United Nations to invest more in Africa's development.
With the resurgence of the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China has done and will continue to do everything in its power to provide the necessary human and material assistance, and is ready to coordinate its efforts with African countries to mobilize greater assistance from the United Nations, WHO and so forth, and to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Neonatal Department and other relays save small lives.
Intruder!
The pregnant mother had an early seizure, and on her way to the hospital, a 32-week premature baby could not wait to be born on Dad's sidecar.
Fortunately, the obstetric and neonatal doctors handled it in a timely manner, and the relay saved this little life.
By coincidence, on the 19th, 20th, 21st day, the Obstetric and Neonatal Unit of the Hubei Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care Institute received three premature births on the way for three days, while the other two were born on a 120-week first aid vehicle, all of which were 29 weeks premature.
Ms. Cheng was a second-born mother, and at 7 a.m. on September 19th, she had a stomach ache, thought that she was 32 weeks pregnant, and that the first birth was premature, and she packed up the baby waiting to take a shower and went straight to the hospital.
After 9:30, Ms. Cheng packed up and let her husband drive from Xu Dong's home to the hospital.
I didn't expect the baby to be born on Dad's sidecar shortly after the car left the house.
20 minutes later, Ms. Cheng and the baby finally arrived at the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Building at the Mother and Child Health Home in Hubei Province.
Hospital security officers saw the upset couple and the baby and immediately informed the maternity ward that Dr. Zhang and Midwife Liu Yanyan, who were waiting for the four doctors and midwives, were going down the stairs with their delivery bags and umbilical cords.
"At that time, the mother was half lying on the side of the car, under the water of sheep and blood, and a baby boy was next to her, with a umbilical cord. "
Zhang Qing asked about the baby's 32 weeks premature birth, the parents on the way didn't have time to cover the children, the early autumn morning was cold, his skin was pale, he didn't cry, and his limbs were weak.
Yoo Ying-hyang went to the co-pilot to deal with the baby's umbilical cords, and Zhang Xiaoqing came in from the cab, quickly opened the delivery bag, covered the baby with a couple of layers of his treatment towels and a package, and cleaned up the respiratory tract for the newborn, and then carried the baby to the 12th floor of Neonatal.
The Neonatal Medical Services came to the nurse's station to rescue the premature baby as soon as they heard.
The baby had a purple face and a lack of oxygen was suffocated, and the doctor gave him a pipe intubation immediately, and in less than a minute, the baby regained its heartbeat, the skin color gradually recovered, and the recovery was successful.
After admission, this 32-week baby got on a trauma respirator, sustained rescue, smooth breathing, and was successfully evacuated the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby's vital signs are stable, breathing is smooth, and it's starting to breastfeed.
Coincidentally, on 19, 20, 21, the maternity and neonatal unit of the hospital received three premature births on its way for three days in a row, while the other two were born in 120 first aid vehicles, 29 weeks premature, and are currently active in neonatal care.
Mr. Sun Guoqiang, Director of Obstetrics at the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Centre, explained that, in recent years, mothers and children had attended to a number of babies born on the subway in private cars, a situation which could threaten the lives of their mothers and children.
Director Sun reminds pregnant mothers to come to the hospital as soon as they have a diarrhea, break water, see Red, etc.
In the event that a woman is present at home or on the road, she should be able to lie down as flatly as possible, with blankets on her buttocks and so on, so as to prevent the baby from falling back into the ground. The child should be warm as soon as he comes out and brought to the hospital as soon as possible.

Wuhan's promotion of industrial intelligence has given up to $20 million in subsidies.
On 27th, journalists learned from the launch of the City of Wuhan City News, "Glorious New China" series, that since this year, the city has accelerated its industrial intellectual transformation and implemented a transformational subsidy of up to 20 million yuan.
To date, more than 800 information has been collected on the intellectual transformation needs of industrial enterprises of more than 800 sizes.
According to Zhang Hong, Deputy Director General of the Economics and Informatization Department of Wuhan City, starting this year, Wuhan launched an action plan for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, offering free advisory diagnostic services and solutions to industrial enterprises of higher size than demand, and fully advancing the new round of high-level enterprise technological transformation.
In accordance with the plan, the city of Wuhan publicly selects a number of specialized diagnostic services each year to conduct a needs-based smart transformation survey for all industrial enterprises of the city ' s size and above, including through the creation of columns, questionnaires and reports.
To date, information has been collected on the intellectual transformation needs of more than 800 industrial enterprises, accounting for almost one third of all industrial enterprises in the city.
Five municipal diagnostic platforms have organized teams in firms to conduct "one-on-one" field assessments and programme validations.
Zhang Hong reported that the city was currently organizing 373 smart transformation projects, with a total investment of $29,760 million, the top 5G smart production line in IYK, the national leading smart cellular production line in Motorola, the digitized unmanned plant for Wuhan Siemens sub-pressure transformers, the first nationwide quantitative satellite production line for space scientists, the return to the biological world leading the new veterinary intelligent production line, and the successive start-up of smart workshops and intelligent factories in industries such as the smart production line for Eurobond IntelNet.
In addition, Wuhan City has increased its financial support for smart transformation projects.
These include investment in industrial enterprises that are intelligently modified and actually completed; investment in equipment hardware, soft investment in R & D, with 8 per cent and a transition grant of up to $20 million.
At the same time, financial institutions, such as the Wuhan branch of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, provide individualized financial services specifically for industrial smart transformation and significantly reduce the pressure on corporate finance.
"Trudo" "The Man Falls." Will he be successful in his second term?
This time, Trudeau got out of the big hole, and it was Trudeau himself who dug it up a little bit.
In recent days, the Canadian media have exposed several old pictures of the current Prime Minister, Trudeau, in which Trudeau dressed himself as a black person.
This is perceived as a clear act of racial discrimination, triggering a wave of violence in Canada.
After what happened, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians don't buy much.
Trudeau kind of moved a rock and smashed his own foot.
As political critic Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the anti-black-face movement in the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party have been calling the opposition parties or dissidents within the party "substantially " and have repeatedly threatened "that whoever makes this mistake should be dismissed immediately " .
Simply put, this trip to Trudo's big hole, it was Trudo himself who dug it up a little bit.
Trudeau is the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, a young and handsome man, who, when he was on his way out, had a moment of political idols.
Formerly a political figure, after taking over as head of the Federal Liberal Party, he fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the Canadian federal legislative elections of 2015 – the Federal Liberal Party, half of the seats in the Federal House of Commons, with its valuable separate governmental powers.
At that time, Trudeau put forward a number of political platforms, such as " Ethnicity and Gender " , " Eco-Environmental Environment " , " Economic Revival " , which emphasized the eradication of corruption and "the culture of injustice".
However, for five years in office, he has been " walking high and low " in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.
In terms of "ethnicity and gender equality", leaving aside the "black-face" incident, he was "blessed" on a series of Aboriginal issues, which led First Nations groups, leaders, to move protest tents to the gates of the Hills of Congress on the 150th anniversary of Canada 's founding.
In the fight against corruption, at the end of last year, Trudeau was involved in the boiling "Ranving" incident.
He was exposed to a major fraud by his home construction and engineering company, Ranvinlin, and pressured the department and officials in charge of the investigation to ask the latter to "do a great job " .
Moreover, Trudeau, after the incident, was angry at the officials who revealed the malpractices – the formerly mentioned Wang Chau-di, who was the first to disclose the malpractices and was the Attorney General of Canada when he was directly involved in the case.
Even though the case itself is questionable, it's hard to get rid of the suspicion.
According to many observers, the fall of the Trudeau regime for five years was largely the result of its own pits, the biggest of which were the three.
The most authoritative Angus-Reed poll data in Canada show that, from 2015 to the present, those who supported Trudeau slipped from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent, while opponents jumped from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Although the other opposition parties and their party leaders have performed similarly poorly, even a significant proportion of voters who still wish to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now not convinced of the Federation Prime Minister ' s leadership.
On 21 October, when the new Canadian federal legislative elections are about to begin, will Trudeau be able to repeat what he won five years ago?
The answer may be one word: hard.
Whether it is at the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience or regional aviation integration, the development integration dimension of Kyoto is far-reaching and positive.
On September 25th, Beijing Daesing International Airport officially sailed.
Reporters from the New Kyoto newspaper have been informed by the Beijing Municipal Development and Rehabilitation Board that the capital airport is in a state of super-saturated operation and that the opening of the Great International Airport will enhance the capacity of the capital ' s air services.
Following Shanghai, Beijing became the second city with two airports in our common city, serving primarily domestic aviation services, similar to Shanghai Rainbow Bridge International Airport, which is dominated by international shipping, and the future capital airport and Da Hing Airport, which will also provide a more disaggregated service based on differences in service to different air operations, both domestic and international.
In terms of operational development, it's more beneficial for the capital airport.
The capital airport, which passed 100 million passengers in 2018, is the country ' s largest, but still has a significant capacity deficit compared to the fast-growing demand for business, especially for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers, travel, etc., and in response to the growing openness of Beijing and the trend towards internationally connected cities, Dae-Hing International Airport has been positioned as a major international hub airport, with plans to meet 100 million annual passengers and 4 million tons of mail and mail.
So there's no overlap between the two airports, targeting different client groups, and there's enough market space.
At the economic level, it is clear that the navigation of the International Airport will have a win-win effect by easing tensions in Beijing, accelerating the rate of passenger and cargo throughput, and building incremental cakes for the two-nuclear operation of the Capital.
From a user ' s point of view, as the international airport moves through the capital, it is not necessary to concentrate all of it in the future, but also to reduce a number of problems associated with the excessive concentration of routes, such as longer stop security, slower boarding of passengers, indirectly increasing the length of aircraft and passengers ' stay at the airport, increasing the burden of airport operations, reduced shipping through the capital airport and, in fact, improved passenger travel experience.
According to media estimates of the time and cost of various transport routes to large international airports, such as travelling directly to Da Hing on the Kiyotung highway from the South 5th Ring and driving in 50 minutes, oil money comes back and goes back to about $40, and the high rate is $15; the rail train is selected for a distance of 20 km, 30 km, and the fare is set at $10, $25, $35; citizens can also travel between Beijing West Station and the Da Hing airport station for more than 20 minutes.
In general, citizens have a wide range of transport options at Da Hing Airport, and the costs and time are within a reasonable range.
From a trend point of view: Da Hing Airport is located as a traffic hub in Kyouta and is therefore a little further away from Beijing, but has increased radiation to Hebei, Tianjin, and has facilitated more people ' s movement. It is important for the economic development of Tianjin to pull Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei, the Tianjin passengers will be able to benefit from the increased international air route service provided by Da Hing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning at Da Hing Airport.
In addition to the new airport line in Beijing, which leads directly to the airport, there are several highways connecting the airport to the surrounding area.
It's just like Guangdong Dongdong, Fushan, Chong Wan and other city passengers can go to Bai Yun Airport in Guangzhou on Guangzhou Highway, and residents of Beijing, Yu An-Shun, etc. will also benefit from the Great Euphoria Airport and receive easy and efficient air services.
As can be seen, the opening of Dahin International Airport is not limited to additional runways and aircraft, either from the level of corporate competition, from the level of consumer experience, or from the integration of regional aviation, and from the development of the integration dimension of Kyoto, which has far-reaching and positive implications, not only for the long-term layout and development of the shipping industry in Beijing, but also for the diversification of options for the movement of a large number of residents in Kyoto, the further improvement of the quality of services in the shipping industry in Beijing, and the promotion of the integrated development process in Kyoto, and the economic and trade development around the airport.
So, for the airport, we're not only making small payments for ourselves, but also for the overall development.

Forum on socio-economic issues in Viet Nam, 2019, held in the province of Suntsun
The Vice-President of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Viet Nam, Nguyen Dejeng, revealed that, at the beginning of the year, Viet Nam ' s economic and social development had seen many new developments and continued growth.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, participants held an in-depth exchange of views and views on four themes: economic development in 2019 and the impact of selected FTAs, outstanding issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019, outstanding issues in the Vietnamese socio-cultural context in 2019, and projections and recommendations for the socio-economic development of Viet Nam in 2020.
There was general agreement that global economic growth slowed in the first months of 2019 and that risks and challenges increased.
Trade frictions among the major economies have further reduced global trade and investment.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), despite the uncertainty of the global economy, in which 70 per cent of the world ' s economies had stagnated in growth, Viet Nam ' s economic development had achieved many promising results, with stable macroeconomic performance, effective control of inflation and an average increase of 2.64 per cent in the consumer price index for the first half of 2019, the lowest in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, but the increase was still high compared to the same period in 2011-2017.
In forecasting Viet Nam ' s economic development trends from 2019 to 2020, the Deputy Director of the National Economic and Social Forecasting Centre of Viet Nam, Dundeyn, said that the Vietnamese economy had shown a high growth momentum in 2019 against the backdrop of the turmoil in the world economy.
By 2020, Viet Nam ' s macroeconomic stability is expected to remain generally stable, the implementation of the various FTAs will contribute to trade development, the restructuring of the economy, the improvement of the business environment is further strengthened, and Viet Nam ' s external export activity will decline as a result of trade frictions ...
It is therefore necessary to strengthen early warning mechanisms for monitoring forecasts, proactively seek trade relief measures for Viet Nam ' s exports, find opportunities to expand new export markets and facilitate the export of various commodities, including agricultural and water products.
At the same time, the inflation rate is kept at a reasonable level, thereby contributing to the development of ancillary industries and supporting the development of high-tech, organic and eco-agriculture.
Liu Jie, Director of the Consular Office in Siem Reap, Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, hosted a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Liu Jijie said that, 70 years after the establishment of the new China, China has actively participated in international affairs and contributed to China ' s intellectual and Chinese programmes to improve global economic governance and promote common global development, making an important contribution to world peace and development and bringing tangible benefits to Cambodia ' s economic development and the well-being of its people.
Liu Jijie explained that, as the world's second largest economy, China contributed more than 30 per cent to world economic growth, in particular through the "one-way" initiative of China, where cooperation between local provinces and cities and the provinces of Siem Reap and Siem Reap continued to deepen.
He said that this year marked the beginning of 61 years of Chinese-Cambodian relations, that the two countries had fraternal friendships and that mutually beneficial cooperation would be the driving force behind the local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siem Reap Province, Dishiah, highly praised the great achievements of the new China over the past 70 years, and congratulated the Chinese and Chinese countries on the results of their friendly cooperation.
Desakha expects both sides to continue to work together to further Chinese-Chinese friendship and cooperation, to strengthen mutual trust and benefit and to continuously improve the living standards of their people ...
According to Desaikha, Siem Reap Province has had remarkable relations with China ' s provinces and cities, and has so far entered into friendly relations with China ' s 28 provinces and cities. The large cultural performance projects "Og smile" and "Ug Ko dynasty" have landed, the Siem Reap-Gangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, the Siem Reap New International Airport Project, the Siem Reap Government officials ' special training course, the Siem Rey University Scholarship, rural consultations, the renovation of urban roads, the cataract restoration public goods project "Light Walk" and so forth, and the people of Siem Reap have become direct beneficiaries in the context of friendly cooperation in Cambodia.
The reception was attended by the State Secretary of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Ken Wensson, the President of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, the Governor of the 5 provinces in the region, the Siem Reap branch of the Cambodian Council, volunteer teachers, the Siem Reap branch of the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce, representatives of Chinese companies and representatives of foreign leaders in Siem Reap.
We've witnessed the 10 years of digital China in Cloudy Town.
If the 2009 local website forum were to be used as a starting point, the 2019 Cloud Habitat Congress in Hangzhou has been going on for a decade now.
From the concept of cloud fog, to the practice of upper cloud, big data, cloud computing became one of the core technologies underpinning China's economic development, social management, and public services over 10 years.
At the Jin-tae new energy light voltage battery workshop in Heining, Zhejiang, there were recently a number of new "coworkers" with AI intelligence on their hands.
It's open for 24 hours, it's more than twice the speed of identification as manual, and the accuracy of the quality check is stable at more than 95 per cent.
According to the head of the company, the Quality Checker with the camera has focused on more than 40,000 defective samples, which, with the cloud computing power behind it, can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages, with defective battery pieces classified.
This firm is just a microcosm of today's cloud computing support manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Informationization issued the " Guide to Promoting the Implementation of Corporate Clouds (2018-2020) " , proposing to achieve a significant increase in the awareness and motivation of enterprises by 2020, with a significant increase in the proportion and depth of applications.
The founder of Ariyun, King Ken, said that today, data-centred cloud computing has opened the way for data to bridge the digital economy of key elements.
At the same time, our cloud computing industry has been expanding over the past 10 years.
The " White Paper on cloud computing development (2019) " released by the Chinese Institute of Information and Communications Research in July of this year showed that the total market size of the Chinese cloud computing in 2018 was 96.28 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2 per cent over 2017.
In addition to being the key technology for supporting industrial transformation, the invisible cloud has transformed urban governance and social life.
This year's cloud-dwelling convention, the city brain for three years in a row is still interesting.
The Aliun side described that the urban brain has now become the hub of urban governance from a traffic governance tool, and that the collaborative application has been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brain achieves new urban management services such as "stop and pay first" and "Tourism route design" through strong computing capabilities.
In the area of government services, the "one cloud" is a "one thing" and the "one desk" is a coordinated push. Cloud computing facilitates the supply of government services.
Zhejiang has now established a province-wide common public data platform through the top management cloud.
As of 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million resident residents and more than 15 million corporate entities in the province, bringing together 3066 categories of 19.8 billion data.
On average, the Zhejiang provincial government departments have called each month, sharing data up to 12 million times, and every time the data moves on the cloud, it may mean that the crowds do less.
Makoto makes tea with a plastic tea bag!
According to the Central News Agency, a recent study in Canada recently found that a bag of plastic tea bags could release billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than an estimated entire intake of microplastics, but to date there is no evidence that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
Researchers at McGill University in Canada have reportedly found that dipping plastic tea bags into a glass of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees centigrade), will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the total estimated amount of microplastics taken by a person.
According to studies published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year, while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
According to the information received, the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea packs at Montreux Shop and Café, opened the tea bag, washed the tea bag and dipped it into almost boiling water for five minutes, and analysed it using electronic microscopes and spectrometers.
According to this study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, " several steps above the plastic load of other previous foods " .
It is reported that most tea bags are made of natural fibre, but many brands of tea bags made of natural fibre still use plastic to seal them.
Some branded tea bags are no longer paper-based, but instead plastic, which is the subject of tests by researchers.
Plastic particles are microscopic fragments of plastic, and researchers define these microscopic plastics to be in the range of 100 nm to 5 m2 and to be produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deep-sea trenches around the world, running water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first found plastic particles in human excreta samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018.
In order to test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea packs, the Canadian team placed daphnia in contaminated water and found that microplastics affected the behaviour of these daphnia and caused them to develop abnormalities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans ...
WHO notes, however, that more research is needed to understand fully how these plastics spread into the environment and how they affect humans.
Researchers speculate that the large amount of plastic particles released by these tea bags may be due to their exposure to boiling water, which may decompose or seepage toxic substances even when "food grade" plastics are heated up to over 40 degrees Celsius.
According to Guterres, climate emergencies are the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster erodes a generation of human development gains.
This is illustrated by the hurricanes that have struck Papua, Dominica and the Bahamas since this year.
About a quarter of the people in small island developing States live 5 metres or less above sea level ...
The relocation may seriously affect their society and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday ' s Climate Action Summit, small island States are jointly committed to achieving carbon neutrality and 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030, thus once again leading the world in the right direction.
Guterres said: " The climate crisis is accumulating new injustices over old injustices ...
Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are caught in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt ...
The world must act, and the time has come to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States ... "
Today ' s high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transform renewable energy; and urging international institutions to help small island developing States, particularly highly indebted middle-income countries, to access funding.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the lifeline of the planet — the oceans.
The latest special report issued this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered from the severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions are likely to experience extreme sea-level rises that would have occurred only once in a century each year.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.
Contamination, overfishing and acidification have caused huge losses.
In the last 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, and in the last 40 years plastic contamination has increased tenfold.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a decline in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face high transport, energy and infrastructure costs.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, subjecting them to price fluctuations.
Some States are also making efforts to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs ...
Guterres said: " By resolving an issue in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere ...
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the "Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030" will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that can be drawn from around the world ... "
He stressed that small island developing States were the exception to sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the international community as a whole.
The Ministry of Finance of India has indicated that the financial system is sufficiently mobile.
India’s finance minister, Seetalaman, 26, stated that the current financial system is sufficiently liquid and that India’s economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday demand.
Seetalaman made this statement after a meeting with representatives of private Indian banks, non-banking financial institutions, housing banks, etc.
Seetalaman didn't tell us what those statements were about.
Some of the former Indian media and overseas media have attributed the sustained slowdown in the Indian economy to liquidity constraints in non-bank financial institutions.
Seeing the fall in car sales as an example, Seetalaman denied that liquidity constraints were the main cause of the decline in sales.
According to Seetalaman, the decline in automobile sales is mainly due to cyclical factors.
Seetalaman predicted that India's economic growth could recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
India's annual shopping season began in September and will continue until the end of the year.
The market anticipates that shopping consumption will contribute significantly to economic growth in India.
The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education has recently issued a circular prohibiting the violation of the right of primary and secondary schools throughout the province to attend classes during the National Day Leave, and will organize unannounced visits by personnel at random.
In its circular on the prohibition of state holidays, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education stressed the need for primary and secondary schools throughout the country to ensure that, during the celebration of the national day, no students are allowed to organize group remedial or new classes, no students are allowed to conduct courses in subjects, classes of special duration, Osai, classes of interest, higher classes, etc., and that no campuses are allowed to be rented to other educational institutions for the conduct of various courses.
At the same time, there is a strict ban on the organization of working primary and secondary school teachers, on recommending and inducing students to attend extra-curricular and extra-curricular remedial classes, on the participation of working primary and secondary school teachers in out-of-school training institutions or by other teachers, parents, parents ' committees, etc., and on the provision of relevant information by serving primary and secondary school teachers to introduce students to out-of-school training institutions and others.
The circular makes it clear that the established irregularities in primary and secondary schools will result in higher deductions in the local education administration ' s examination for quality development education at the district level in the same year, and that teachers involved in the violation will be dealt with in a serious manner in accordance with the relevant provisions of the teacher ' s and teacher ' s style.
Support for pig production and market supply.
Faith requires that measures be taken in six areas.
A telephonic conference was held today to follow up on the policy measures taken by the Central and Provincial Councils and the provincial government to support the production of pig production and secure the supply of the market.
Be faithful and take care of all six aspects of pig production.
The mayor is responsible for taking the "basket of food" and this year ' s clear provincial mission of 45 million live pigs has been broken down into the city states and incorporated into the accountability test.
Put in place all the policy measures and do the "last kilometer" of the policy.
To ensure the production of piglets, to implement carefully the policy of subsidizing them, to encourage pig-growing enterprises to expand their breeding, and to systematically select excellent piglets from the group of commercial pigs.
Take the initiative and make it a top priority to attract funds to large farming enterprises that are not yet well-known in our province.
Take care of the market system, speed up the construction of cold-chain logistics facilities for pigs, and promote a shift from pig to meat.
Take care of the modern system of immunization, with basic quarantine personnel commensurate with the size of the farm and the tasks of the work, and secure the first line of protection against disease and disease.
Be faithful and do everything in its power to secure the meat market, ensure that there is no large shortage, large-scale disconnection, and ensure a stable supply of pork for major holidays.
The meeting was also deployed to sustain the control of the African swine plague, the ban on retreats in key waters of the Governor's river basin, and the acquisition of medium-to-late rice throughout the province.
Speaking of the motherland, the spirit of the nation, the old Shanghai name of the rabbits and so forth, they take classes for college students.
"Me and My Fatherland" has a little touch on the campus for college students to be happy with.
On the occasion of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, four famous Shanghai Old Letters, " Art Party " , gathered on the 27th day of the Shanghai Polytechnic University, four Shanghai Old Letters, representing more than 90 years on average, were made in Shanghai, and more than 200 young students were told about their country, the spirits of the nation.
It's an old-word branding show.
The talk in the classroom made the students wonder that the display of the old branded product was well placed outside the classroom, and that the "Me and My Fatherland" campus was stuck to make college students happy.
Big hare lipstick, big hare ice cream... as an old-word brand, Big harem milk candy has been active in recent years, aggressive, innovating and cross-bordering.
Born in 1959, the big white rabbit just happened to be 60 this year.
He also looks at the youth consumers.
The Deputy General Manager, Wang Wei Jie, the secretary of the party in Shanghai's Mandarin Food Company Ltd., referred to the scene of "Spring with abalones, summer with hot fish, autumn with blizzards with drunk shrimps, winter clouds with drunk crabs" as a reflection of people's constant innovation in eating.
Companies have also developed brand culture in terms of taste innovation, cartoon packaging design, etc., to adapt to the heritage of younger consumer groups.
The old word represents the way of innovation on the scene of Art Party.
The manager of Shanghai Feathers and Diners Co. Ltd. agreed that " all innovations are based on solid foundations, and the old word is a thin-haired process " .
Everybody's got an old word in their heart.
At the center of the product, the age of small beauty should begin ... "
As one of the first Chinese characters in the country, Shanghai Feathers quickly adapted to market trends, upgraded brands visually, introduced professional operators and achieved a significant increase in turnover.
"The old word is not only visible in such traditional channels as supermarkets, but now the old word is also actively involved in new retailing and activities.
All our changes, ultimately, are to be made to the end that consumers can see, hear and, finally, buy ... "
Uyang Jae Ling, Deputy General Manager of Shanghai Soap Co. Ltd., said...
In the future, Shanghai soap production will continue to develop at a high level, with a promising system, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products satisfactory to users, and on a high-tech, cost-effective path.
Through this art party class, the students are getting a lot of money.
I grew up with the old word, with the good memories and emotions of my childhood. "
I'm sorry to hear that.
The Shanghai Old Letter represents the nation's spirit for more than 200 young students.
Chou Qing said that how to tap into brand culture, so that quality traditional culture can be passed on from generation to generation, is a question we need to think about and explore as a design student.
The Party class is based on the "Shanghai Image" project of Ting Wei, Dean of the School of Arts of the University of Technology in Huadong, Professor Niang's "Old Words Incorporated Brand Innovative Studio", which seeks to deepen the cultural potential and modern commercial value of the Old Words, to use their competitiveness and influence to enhance the concentration of cultural radioactivity of the Old Words in Shanghai, to achieve the industrial effect of 1+1>2 in the form of "Design + Culture" and to present Shanghai culture from a new perspective.
According to the information received, the Arts Party class will also continue to invite people of literature, painting masters, pottery masters, non-herding masters, architects, landscape masters, lecturers, through whom they tell stories of innovation and adherence to Chinese culture, highlight the characteristics of the time, strengthen the ideals of university students, foster the love of the student, speak with the work, innovate in the form of party classes, teach subjects that students love, enhance the ideological, theoretical, affinity and orientation of the party, increase the virulence of the party class and develop the newcomer who can take up the post of national renaissance!

In conclusion, I wish Japan a vibrant relationship and my friends a prosperous career.
"Some of the over-age farmers on the site are estimated to be more than half.
Where do we find young workers now?
There's no way to use so many old people on the site. "
Recently, Zou Kui, a contractor working in the construction industry for a long time, lamented the existence of a large number of over-age farmers on the site (over retirement age).
In recent times, I've been working on rain-distribution projects in my high school, and there are a lot of farmers on the campus, and if you look closely, you'll find a lot of over-age farmers in it.
Over-age farmers are not "sleep" out of work, but because they are "sleep" and have the insatiable and hard work of having to do so — whether they save money to solve their old-age and medical problems or help their children, and they keep these old people who should be "sleep" from working hard.
The "old man" of the over-age farmer, not as easy as we thought.
Raising children, raising old people, helping children to study, helping them build buildings to buy cars, helping their children to start a family, raising grandchildren from generation to generation, and when these farm workers do their "life mission " , money bags have been emptied, even debted, mostly lacking in wealth.
In order not to drag children and save themselves some wealth, a lot of farmers insist on "doing it until it's done."
Many of the new generations of after-80 "after-90" and "after-00" farmers are reluctant to engage in hard-working secondary industries or low-end services, creating structural "work waste " , which are unattractive and provide opportunities for over-age farmers.
Because of the lack of skills and the decline in physical and labour skills, many over-age farmers are engaged in intensive, low-paying, high-risk and low-security jobs.
A day's work is a day's work, a little more, and the survival of the over-age farmers behind the "don't be idle" cannot be ignored and ignored.
Addressing the problems of unpaid wages and wages, improving labour protection, reducing security risks, increasing labour income and improving the survival of over-age farmers, apart from their " self-help " , is equally essential to public sector institutional care and human care.
It has been pointed out by scholars that over-age farmers are no longer likely to depend on their homes to grow land for their old-age and medical problems, and that they have to support their families by other means.
The insatiable and strong reading of the "unscrupulous" farmers helps us to better understand the love and pain of the oversuppliers.
Seeing the backs of over-age farmers, hearing their groaning, trying to get them back to the countryside to really make their way back to " active old " , needing the public sector, markets and societies to share their responsibilities in a virtuous interaction, and need to combine their efforts.
Chemetsov said that Russia would not export this system for the next five years, because "first supply of its own army before export production takes place " .
This practice is fully consistent with international practice.
The main producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their defence needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Glehoff, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Sky Force, said that the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by the "Goldstone-Antai" Sky Defense Concern.
This is a new generation of anti-aircraft systems using working principles for the destruction of ballistics and aerodynamics.
The main role of S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which are capable of intercepting missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometres.
In addition, according to certain information, S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of drones, exceeding five times the sonic speed, even near space targets.
Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems, in particular the S-400 system, which is very important from a defence point of view.
Sergei Chemetsov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said that the system was in great demand in the world, but the Russian army needed it, including in the Arctic.
S-400 air defence systems in operation in the Arctic.
According to information received on 15 September, the conversion of S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems by the New Earth Islands Arctic Air Defence Regiment has been completed.
It's not Russia's militarization of the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely a process within the transition to more advanced defence tools in the strategic direction of the north.
According to the North Russian Fleet Information Service: " With the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, there has been a marked increase in the controlled airspace of the Arctic ... "
Most importantly, the military has assessed that the system has been successfully used in the far north and the Arctic.
Air Defence Corps personnel trained on the new system and prepared for combat duty.
It was equipped with S-300 long-range air defence systems and is still partially maintained.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must possess weapons capable of destroying a variety of air targets, whether high-speed targets in the outer altitude or "fish leaking" near protected facilities.
According to open sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by the Golden Diamond-Antai Sky Defense Concene, was designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, ultrasound targets and other air strike weapons.
This weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 km and shoot down ballistic targets at a range of 60 km at 4.8 km per second.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the far north to ensure the safety of airspace on the northern seaways.
Not long ago, the first 12 "Tor"-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, and they were sufficient to form an air defence battalion to strengthen the anti-aircraft systems in the Arctic.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said then that the North Pole "Tor" unit would be expanded to a full brigade unit in the future.
Together with the new S-400 remote system deployed on New Earth Island and the Kola Peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short-range system deployed in the far north, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are a powerful shield for the Russian polar sky.
Enemy planes, helicopters and drone missiles will be hard to break through.
According to the Russian government, the flagship shop will serve as a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods and avoid the complex and lengthy process of opening their own.
The Russian company, the Russian store operator, focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
The biggest trading platforms in China, such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, Hand Q (ShouQ), and Wechat, have online shops and have their own online platforms Epinduo.com and Russian retail outlets.
The Russian Export Centre will work with the Russian Federation to develop marketing strategies and standards of participation in shops and screen virtual shelf-loading companies.
The store plans to open by the end of this year and to build up at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to the Russian Export Centre, the total number of visits per month to China's power company platforms is as high as 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, reaching over $1 billion in 2018.
Currently, the Alibaba Group will also open pilot shops for the sale of commodities from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the Global Import Strategy.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display the goods of enterprises selling at least 500 million roubles.
To tell you the truth, my expectations are higher, and 500 million rubles are underselling.
As we all know, Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods and view our commodities as high-quality and green green and environmentally friendly ... "
Kozhevnikov said that competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power was intense and increasing.
He said, " Our goal is ambitious, with 500 businesses launched through this shop in three years... "
At the same time, the platform will also be the product of Russian Far East enterprises.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of the Basics of Trade Policy, Plyanov Economic University, Russia, said: " This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export centre is a State-owned, not a private, agency ... "
"I don't see a lot of highly competitive Russian goods on the market..."
He thought that the project might not really be implemented, but that it would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to the Russian News Agency, Andrei Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Centre, stated during the Eastern Economic Forum that more than 170 Russian enterprises ' product information had been published on the largest international wholesaler platform, Alibaba.com, and could be purchased in China and elsewhere.
In addition, there is a model for cooperation with the Alibaba Group, namely, the training project for Russian enterprises by experts from the University of Bao Po, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will also be the organizer of Russian enterprises' participation in industry exhibitions and business projects at the Second China International Import Fair in Shanghai in November this year.
A major exhibition will be held in the 1,000 m2 exhibition hall, where commercial project activities, protocol signing ceremonies, presentation sessions and meetings with Chinese business representatives will also be held.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
According to the Information Service of the Russian Export Centre: " In addition to the agricultural stand, we will also hold business meetings, i.e. direct contacts between entrepreneurs ... "
" This is another direction of our efforts to support businesses and to ensure that dozens of specialized meetings are arranged for them ... "
In addition, the fair will hold master courses, cooking competitions and Russian-renowned cooking meetings on the project "Exploring Russian Food Top Sea Stations".
Following the decision of the Mohamud Adi Coroner ' s Coroner ' s Court on Friday that the cause of death was not accidental, the police waited for the full report and for instructions from the Attorney-General ' s Office to take the next step.

Xinhua Times Review: We're on our own.
The White Paper "China and the World of the New Age", released on 27th, answers: China's development has been successful for 70 years, because, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the right path to development as a socialism of the Chinese identity and have followed it with determination.
China follows its own path of development. It's the choice of history. The choice of the people.
In recent times, in a climate of poverty and internal distress, generations of ingenuity have sought and followed the path of national salvation.
However, " the monarchy, the restored empire, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system all thought about it, tried it, and it didn ' t work out... "
It was only with the Communist Party of China and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a socialist path to Chinese identity in practice.
China ' s path is one of happiness for the Chinese people, the revival of the Chinese nation and the common development of China and the rest of the world.
It is on the right path that China can do its job well, become the second largest economy in the world and contribute most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As stated in the White Paper, China ' s development path, which is consistent with China ' s national circumstances and adapted to the requirements of the times, will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward ...
In retrospect, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path; in view of the world, the Chinese people value it even more.
The Chinese know the truth about South Orange, they understand that what suits others is not good for themselves, but best for themselves.
It is with this road of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created the most remarkable miracle of the world.
In the course of the twists and turns of the human race, "The End of History" was famous for a while.
Today, the success of China's special socialist path ended with the collapse of the "End of History", the "China Collapse" and the "Socialist Failures".
China ' s success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to become rich and powerful and has expanded the path to modernization of developing countries, providing experience and lessons for countries and peoples in the world that wish to accelerate their development and maintain their independence, on a path that is consistent with their national circumstances.
The world is rich.
China has always respected the right of every country to choose the path of development appropriate to its own circumstances.
China will not "enter" the foreign model, nor "export" the Chinese model, but will firmly pursue its own path, achieve its own continued development, strengthen exchanges with countries on governance and good governance, and make its due contribution to the common good of good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a 66-year-old female worker was fired by text from a owner of the Foodworks supermarket because he preferred to hire an employee from an Asian background, whose practices were strongly criticized as " shameful " .
The Board stated that the way in which Ms. Gail Ayton ' s boss, Jianbin Wang, the English name Eddie, had treated her employees at Wagga Shop for more than 20 years was " grossly unfair " and could violate the anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the store in 2016 and that he had "wanted to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In this case, the Vice-Chairman of the Commission, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the Internet and found out that Mr. Wang had published a number of job advertisements in various Australian employment forums.
Among the job requirements listed in these posts, one said "preferred to Asian women" and the other said "preferred to Asian employees".
And the third post says, "He's more inclined to go overseas."
Mr. Wang dismissed Ms. Ayton by text message in April of this year, later claiming that this was due to her absence from work and the alleged small cash deficit from $5.10 to $30 on the cash register.
But Mr. Sams said that Mr. Wang's reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She's only been absent from one class for three years. The missing amount is a few Australian dollars.
He said that Ms. Ayton's dismissal had nothing to do with her conduct or performance.
He said: " It seems to me that, supported by the evidence of Mr. Wang ' s advertisement for the job, the real reason why the defendant should dismiss her is that he prefers to hire employees with Asian backgrounds. "
According to section 772(f) of Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang ' s actions appear to constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of the applicant is unlawful ... "
Mr. Sams said it would be inappropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton in view of his "describable" treatment.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, a casual worker with an hourly salary of $26.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams indicated that he would submit his own decisions and documents to the Committee for consideration as to whether Mr. Wang ' s actions should be transferred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal laws ...
He said that Mr. Wang had not given Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said, "I think that the defense should take an irresistible, unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, Mr. Wang "waiting" the opportunity, which he thought would `prove' that the applicant's employment was justified. "
"He was wrong... to dismiss the applicant with total disregard for any natural justice and, astonishingly, his imprudent and grossly unjust perfunctory conduct. "
Mr. Sams stated that while Foodworks is a small business, " it must be said frankly that no decent employer will dismiss an employee in the most unfair and perfunctory manner recognized in this case ... "
He said: " It is shameful and extremely unfair ... "
Guangtai is on the run for the Golden Week of the National Day.

Six people denied being involved in the sale of pseudo-macca paper, and the case was referred to the High Court.
Six men suspected of counterfeiting and selling our passports, filing paper and identification cards, including an assistant director of the National Register, and a businessman with the rank of governor, passing through the case on Thursday, and the district court judge approving the charges against trafficking in human beings and trafficking in migrants and transferring them to the High Court for trial.
Among them was the defence counsel for the Chinese-Chinese defendant Le Zhenhua, and Congressman Ryer of Sunset Hole District, who applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the defendant and ceased to represent the defendant, and was granted leave in court.
He states that he himself has drawn criticism from his enemies for representing the accused and that his party of action has been implicated.
He stressed that he was not afraid of any threat in himself, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to discredit the Action Party and the Greek government or other Greek leadership, and that the decision was taken after careful consideration.
He adds that there is no conflict of interest between representing the accused and being a member of Parliament, and that he is not legally prohibited from representing any of the accused, and that until now the accused Le Zhenhua has not been convicted.
The six accused were charged on 12 September of this year before a court of law and denied all guilt and were not granted bail pending charges under article 26E of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Trafficking in Migrants Act and article 466 of the Criminal Code (forgery of documents).
On Thursday, two District Judge Noshaha and Mazlan granted the prosecution ' s application for referral to the High Court of the charges against the six accused under the Anti-Trafficking and Anti-Trafficking in Migrants Act, following the arguments of both parties; as for the charges of forgery of documents, they will appear in the District on 3 October, pending the prosecution ' s transfer of the documents to the defence.
The earlier six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Order 2012 and the judge therefore denied bail.
Walking with the motherland — a unit of the Armed Police.
Kim Qiu, a unit of an average of 1.83 metres in size is in a busy training field.
Shining spears, unique olive greens and red shoulders together form a bright landscape.
The day before, the reporters walked into this party and felt the determination of the Wu police officers to remain party and loyal to the people and their "honour above" love and pursuit.
"Dreaming a glorious life, writing the immortal legends of the new era... " This is a team song written by a team of Fang's soldiers — " Walking with the Fatherland " .
In the team, this song is the motto of every member of the team.
Qi Xiaogwang, 1.92 meters tall, standing in the line.
He has a deeper understanding of honor as the champion of the former Carabinieri.
The honor of the soldiers comes from hard training.
Qi Xiaogwang, as a flagman, has always been a high standard of training.
He's strapped to sandbags, strategized, stunned, blindfolded, stable with wind.
There's a picture of him in his flag career that's always been unforgettable.
A flag-raising ceremony, rain poured down, and no tourists left to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
The moment the flag rises, Xiaogwang feels deeply the glory represented by the five-star red flag on his shoulder.
In 2019, Qi Xiaogwang was selected as the base soldier.
The baseman and the flagman have different standards of movement.
Qi Xiaogwang described the progress of the flagmen and the base soldiers as being more than 20 paces away, but more effort is needed in training.
The base is number one in the first row, which directly determines the alignment of the line.
After the parade started his training, he kicked his legs again and again every day, and he practiced a hard kick.
In the demonstration, he won the ovation of the soldiers at a precise pace.
Almost every member of the team has the same experience as Qi Xiaogwang.
The father of the soldier Joo-Orient was a participant in the 50th anniversary parade 20 years ago.
In order to follow my father's footsteps as a member of the team, he was frustrated once and for all, but never discouraged.
He said, " To walk through Tiananmen Square like my father, to be seen by the party and the people is an honor in my life, and I will suffer anything... "
Entering the team's honour room, eight large words of the capital's "Standard of Stabilisation" are in the blinds.
Mr. Wang Xian of the Chinese political committee introduced that the entire team came from the Beijing Brigade of the Carabineros — an army with a glorious tradition, which took on important tasks such as the opening of the country, the national festivals, the security of successive party national congresses and the maintenance of stability in the capital, and the creation of a large group of British models and individuals, such as the Flag Guard, the "Standing Hero Squadron" and more than 50 units and individuals, who were awarded honours by the State Department, the Central Military Commission and the Armed Police Force.

Vietnam needs to seize opportunities for artificial intelligence development.
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities in terms of their level of preparedness to face the AI wave include prospects, capacity to realize, asset base and development direction.
Singapore is ranked first, followed by cities such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert from the organization, responded to an interview with a journalist on behalf of Mohsen Pevana, saying: " I find it very interesting to review and assess cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam ...
On the whole, I think the future of Viet Nam is bright in a context of high growth rates, strong economic development paths and rapid growth of the human base.
I think Vietnam is on the right path and doing well.
It is important that Viet Nam know how to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to promote more economic development ... "
Artificial intelligence is completely changing people's work, communication and lifestyle.
It brings with it greater efficiency, but it also poses a threat of increasing social, economic and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, there are no cities in the world that are ready for the breakthroughs of the age of artificial intelligence.

About 800 million people travel to China on the occasion of the Fourth World Conference on Tourism.
About 800 million people are going out on the upcoming 11th Golden Week!
According to the data from a number of tourist platforms, the market for tourism consumption in our country is booming in both demand and supply.
The Journey Tour Report projects that, based on statistics from previous national holidays, it is expected that the number of domestic tourists this year will be close to 800 million; more than 7.5 million more trips will be made abroad.
Currently, tourists from more than 500 cities have access to the platform to book tours, walk freely, customize tourism, play locally, etc., covering 100 countries and territories.
According to the Chinese Tourism Institute, 726 million domestic tourists were hosted on the national holiday last year, an increase of 9.43 per cent over the previous year.
Not only will the number of tourists be renewed, but the increase in consumption will also be the theme of the holiday.
It is reported that the cost of inter-provincial tourism in the country on the National Day holiday was over $3,000 per person, an increase over the same period last year, owing to the fact that tourists generally opted for better-experienced products, such as high-rated brand hotels, shopping-free tour groups, elite groups, car guides, etc.
There's a similar trend, with Mom's Travel Network booking data, where comfort cars are used throughout the long line of the country, and "principals" of less than 10 people are more popular than in previous years.
Spring and fall travel data show that its consumers are more interested in experience, service, and differential "slow-paced " .
Flying pig data show that the country ' s four-line and suburban tourist reservations are growing fastest, reaching 30% by the same year, refracturing the rising consumption of more parts of the country.
Personalization is a major feature of the 11th Golden Week this year.
Portfolio data show that the number of car rentals is expected to increase by nearly 60 per cent over the same year, while the short-distance travel of small groups of people visiting the perimeter continues to be appreciated; the number of private group registrations has increased by up to 155 per cent over the same period.
Sharing joy becomes the main purpose of people's travel and leisure.
The data show that 28 per cent of the holiday visitors on the National Day are parents and children, 25 per cent are couples and 23 per cent are colleagues and friends.
Also, in terms of the age of tourists, "after 80" and "after 90" account for more than 50% of the total number of visitors.
It is a matter of concern that, unlike in the past, the growth of the gold sector has been more rapid, and this year the domestic market has been more "blowing " .
Flying pig data show that the number of people booking the country's cultural and travel routes this year's national holiday has increased by 42 per cent compared to the previous year, faster than travel.
Industry analyses that, while demand is strong, tourism supply side reforms are being promoted across the country to provide tourists with a richer "Handover" ...
For example, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the National Directorate of Sports, has recently issued a joint launch of the " Favourable Route for Sports and Tourism for the 11th Golden Week of 2019 " ; the launch of 7 cultural and tourist events in Shanghai in 2019, which attracted foreign and Chinese tourists; and the introduction of price reduction or free measures in viewing areas in several provinces, such as Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan and Shandong.
Portfolio data show that destinations with unique natural or cultural characteristics in the country are the most " hot " , Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xian, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin will be the most popular tourist destination in the country.

China is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market.
An animal protein analyst from the Dutch Cooperative Bank (Rabobank) said that China faced a severe shortage of pork following the outbreak of the African pigpest and was expected to become Australia ' s largest export market for beef.
Since the outbreak, Chinese consumers are shifting from eating pork to other animal proteins. The epidemic has caused the authorities to destroy many herds. Over the past year, the number of live pigs in China has been reduced by half, and the price of pork has almost doubled.
China produces and consumes two thirds of the world ' s pork.
According to Chenjun Pan, a senior animal protein analyst from the Dutch cooperative bank in China, demand for other meats, including beef, has increased, China, the world’s largest animal protein importer, currently imports 27 per cent of world pork, and beef imports 24 per cent of the world’s meat.
Ms. Ban said that Chinese beef imports from Australia had increased by 65 per cent in the first half of the year, and China had surpassed the United States and Japan and had become Australia ' s largest export market for beef.
Yesterday, the Chinese Government stated that more pork would be released from emergency reserves before the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.

The world's highest-age barber died at the age of 108.
There is Anthony Mancinelli, the world's highest-age barber certified in the world record in New York, in the United States of America, who never retired to barter his guests every day, but in 19 days Mansinelli died as a result of cancer in his jaw, and left his 96-year-old hair cut.
According to CNN, Mansinelli emigrated to the United States when she was eight years old, helped clean the floor in a barber shop, started picking up scissors for customers when she was 12 years old, thereby easing the economic pressure in the family.
Mancinelli was in primary school, but he didn't graduate.
The son of Mansinelli, Robert, revealed that his father loved work and people from all over the world loved him, but he was diagnosed with cancer in February this year and was unable to work for physical reasons for six weeks before he died, but that was not retirement because he was planning to come back to cut his hair when he was better.
82-year-old Robert said he had to find a new barber now after his father died, because he was asked to cut his hair all his life.
Over $100 billion worth of repurchases by listed companies during the year.
In order to stabilize the company ' s share price, maintain its image, and in the last two years, listed companies have begun to buy back shares frequently and, by means of targeted buybacks and a pool of competitive transactions, wish to convey to the market the information that the company ' s value is undervalued, thereby stabilizing the price and enhancing investor confidence.
According to Eastern Wealth Choice data, the amount of money that listed companies spent on repurchases in 2017 was $7.9 billion, which jumped to $51 billion in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of repurchases by A-listed companies has exceeded $100 billion, bringing the A-stocks to a new level, far higher than in previous years.
From the point of view of the purpose of the repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares appears to be on the same increase as that of the major shareholders, but there are significant differences in the subject matter, the source of the repurchase, the purpose of the repurchase, the equity interest in the stock itself, etc.
In an interview with the Daily Securities Journal, the Chairman of McCoron Information Consulting Limited of Shanghai, Seo-yang, stated that the " Opinion on Support for Repurchase of Stock in Listed Companies " , issued in November 2018, had improved on the problems of the current system, such as narrow repurchase of shares, complicated decision-making procedures and inadequate inventory systems, which had increased significantly in the year as a result of policy incentives for repurchase of shares by listed companies.
In January of this year, I submitted the formal publication of the " Regulations for the Implementation of Repurchase of Stock by Listed Companies " , which expanded the sources of funding for Repurchase by Listed Companies, simplified implementation procedures, guided improved governance arrangements and encouraged listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee-holding schemes.
After the comment was made, the listed company performed a repurchase operation with more applicability, a simpler repurchase process and a greater incentive to repurchase shares.
Repurchase of shares at relatively low positions would also facilitate the efficient use of funds by listed companies, thereby increasing the level of profitability per share, increasing the rate of return on net assets and reducing the pressure on corporate profitability indicators.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is even more significant than the increase in large shareholders, and reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their market value and cash flows.
Xuyang argued that undervaluation was the main factor in repurchases by listed companies, which no longer reflected the future prospects of the company, and that such companies deserved the attention of investors, but could not invest blindly, and that attention needed to be paid to the financial statements of such listed companies as well as to the specific circumstances of their operations.
Listed companies with large-scale buybacks at least show their confidence in development and financial strength.
The repurchase enthusiasm of A-listed companies has also led to a steady increase in repurchase behaviour. The data show that nearly a thousand listed companies have been repurchased this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main players in the buy-back market.
China recently disclosed progress in repurchases, stating that the company had accumulated 57.559 million shares in A through a centralized competitive exchange, accounting for 0.315 per cent of the company ' s total equity, that the total amount paid was $5 billion (excluding transaction costs), and that the repurchases would be used entirely for employee holding schemes, including, but not limited to, the long-term service plans considered and adopted by the company ' s shareholders ' general meeting.
Eli shares have been paid $5,792 million for repurchase of shares and recently adjusted for repurchase of shares, from the planned "repurchase of shares" to the cumulative "repurchase of 183 million shares "as a source of later implementation of equity incentives, of which 152 million were for equity incentives and the remaining 3.04 million were to be written off to reduce registered capital " .
The Ily shares indicate that the cancellation of some of the repurchased shares would further raise the level of return per share and effectively improve the return on investment of the company ' s shareholders.
On 25 September, TCL Group issued an announcement on the progress of repurchases, indicating that TCL Group cumulatively repurchases 3.39 per cent of the company ' s shares at a total cost of $1.65 billion.
The TCL Group Board Office stated to the Daily Securities Reporter that repurchases would be used for employee holding schemes, equity incentives, or conversions to stock of corporate bonds issued by listed companies.
TCL Group adheres to established business strategies, increasing competitiveness and sustained healthy development.
Based on confidence in the future development of the company and the preservation of investors ' interests, the company plans to use its own funds, self-financing and other forms of financing to buy back its shares, taking into account the performance of the company ' s second-tier market over the past year and taking into account the company ' s business and financial situation.
According to Yang Delong, the chief economist at the former Kaitsu Foundation, the operation of stock buybacks by listed companies can, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares in the market and increase each share of the earnings of listed companies, which is an important benefit for the value of the second-tier market; and, on the other hand, the willingness of listed companies to offer real cash and silver to buy back and cancel stocks from the stock market has greatly boosted market confidence.
Repurchases by domestic listed companies have been increasing in recent years, particularly merit-based shares, and it is a very good way to boost investor confidence through stock buy-backs, as well as a positive and encouraging approach.
Hunan Province Standing Committee, Changsha City Council Secretary, Hu Shinghua, and the four leaders of the Engineering and Mechanical Manufacturing Army — Jan Jun-Shun, Liang Shun-geun, Ho Qing-hwa, Liu Fei-heung — set a "small goal" around "From Engineering and Mechanics to Smart Manufacturing" — three or five years later, building the world's leading engineering and machinery industry cluster.
The construction of the world ' s leading engineering and mechanical cluster in Changsha, in the words of the current fashion, is "the most powerful of the earth."
As the capital city of the interior province, Changsha shouts such rhetoric.
It's based on the power of the air.
The four engineering machines that took part in the dialogue, each with its own hands, covered the sky, the ground, the sea, the whole land area: the river's smart light aircraft, the concrete transport pump of the Central and Central Quakers, the full-ground crane of the trio, the tunnel shield of the iron and redevelopment workers, whose "hard power" is the only way to look at the males.
Once upon a time, China had little say in engineering and machinery manufacturing.
The Chinese company has brought in a two-wheel drive to take the one-way drive, buy, merge, build factories, and so forth, and has become a global engineering and machinery industry.
Of these, three or more heavy jobs, the Central and Central United Nations Section, the iron and steel construction works, and engineering and mechanical leading enterprises such as Yamada Smart, whose production value, market occupancy, sales and other key economic indicators are already well ahead of similar enterprises.
It's time for the camera to move.
The "Four Great Kongs" of the Engineering Mechanics are the best of the Changsha Engineering and Mechanical Industries and head of the global engineering and mechanical industries.
In the world's industry, it's hard to say who survives and lives well.
In earlier years, the global engineering and machinery industry had suffered a cold winter, and a number of internationally recognized engineering and machinery manufacturing companies had fallen, but Changsha ' s engineering and machinery manufacturing industry had made "Cat Winter" a "winter swim", self-pressure, self-break, transformation from manufacturing to ingenuity through industrial restructuring, and not only had the past but had stronger bones.
It's based on the political solidarity of the stars.
The development of industries of advantage requires both active enterprise and government action.
Changsha's reputation for "the capital of engineering machinery" is that it brings together a whole industry chain from upstream to downstream, creates a number of clusters of related industries and reduces the cost of sales by optimizing the business environment, improving service packages, streamlining the licensing process and other services, research and development, manufacturing and marketing.
Good business ecology, bringing engineering and machinery to power.
History has pushed the sand to the front desk of the world's leading engineering machine.
Governments, businesses, and even related producers and researchers, should seize opportunities, step up, target, sustain their efforts, and contribute to the building of powerful powers.
Wang Yi chaired the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African States members of the Security Council.

The two sides should be united in their efforts, through negotiation, self-reliance and development.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the African States participating in the Conference thanked China for its initiative to convene the Conference and congratulated the New China on its 70th anniversary.
The Ministers stated that the relationship between Africa and China is based on equality and mutual respect and that Africa and China have always been the most trusted and trusted partners to each other ...
The African Group appreciates the important and positive role played by China as a permanent member of the Security Council in African affairs, which has contributed significantly to a just and reasonable solution to Africa ' s problems, as well as the great efforts and contributions made to the defence of Africa ' s interests and to the promotion of peace and security in Africa.
Africa is currently facing the threat of terrorism and extremism, and only by addressing security issues can Africa truly achieve long-term peaceful development ...
Looking forward to further coordination of positions with China in the Council and strengthening of solidarity and cooperation ...
Wang Yi said that there was an important consensus at today ' s meeting.
We all support the preservation of multilateralism, the strengthening of the authority and role of the United Nations, the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rejection of unilateralism and hegemony; we all agree to strengthen mutual support and cooperation in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council and to safeguard the common interests of Central Africa and the developing countries in general; we all support African countries in their African approach to African problems and request the United Nations to provide financial support for African-owned peace operations; we all support the concept of "cooperation for development and development for peace" to help African countries achieve autonomous and sustainable development; we all stand firm in our defence of the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and reject any State that creates obstacles for them and denies them the right to development.

The 58-year-old villager, Xavily, in a professional cooperative for the development of the people of the town, filled the grub with the last straw in the sheep's coop, standing by the grub, watching the white lake goat chew.
"Beautiful. When the fall and winter are full, you can get a good price out of the fence. "
Xavilli said he fed the sheep "special feeding" every day, regularly cleaned, disinfected, carefully served.
Xavier raised sheep for more than 20 years, until he came to work at the cooperative to know how rough the sheep used to be.
Xavily is from the village of the summer flood village of the town of Qingyang, Qingyang, Gansu province.
His right-hand neighbor is a sheep-breeding family, but he insists on the traditional way of scattering, the quality of the sheep is poor and the numbers are small.
In June of this year, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative under the guidance of the Government and everything began to change.
Xavier's been working on it all day, because he's always holding on to it.
The stockholders are poor families, they trust the sheep to the cooperative, and they count on him if they can split the money and sell it at the end of the year.
It's good to have technical guidance, he's learned to control the disease, he's got the science to feed him, and he's a few of the village farming.
A professional cooperative for the development of the people is a standardized cooperative, with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lake goats.
The director of the cooperative, Zou Tao, said that there were doors inside and outside the standardized sheep shed.
"The wool is thick, it can breed bacteria, the lake sheep can't stay in a hot, wet place, the shed must be built in a three-sided ditch, and it must be filled with a wind changer to ventilate the heat ... "
Zoutao said that, in order to prevent the disease, it was necessary to spray the sheep shed regularly and give the sheep three to four times a quarter.
In addition to living well, fat little goats have to eat mixed grass with green corn, wheat grass, aphids, and have enough wide playgrounds to stretch their bones.
Cooperatives use a foster-care approach to guide local farmers to place good-planted lake goats here, unify, manage, market, plant well, scientificize, standardize, and promote intensive farming.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep in their shares receive more than $6,000 per household per year, and four of them work in cooperatives.
From the word "grazing" to the word "precision feeding", from the word "local mating" to the word " artificial insemination", from the words "seeing body size, touching belly" to the word "bing-by-bing" in Gansu Qingyang... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Zoutao said that if market prices were weak, the local leader, Gansu Shun Sheeng Farming Development Co. Ltd., would buy up at a market price of $27 per kilogram to help farmers spread market risk.
Xu Jianfeng, General Adviser, Gansu Agricultural and Livestock Development Co. Ltd., said that companies had led more and more poor households to learn about the " sheep ' s past " by providing loan guarantees, sheep ' s supply, orders ' farming, purchase of offers, unified processing and marketing services.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families achieved a steady increase in their harvests through the cultivation of pastures and pastures in the Allies.
Qingyang City is in the northern agricultural belt, rich in grass.
There are currently 913 large-scale sheep farms in the city, with cooperatives raising more than 5 million goats, and two 1.3 million meat and sheep slaughter-scale processed production lines, which are becoming the "lead sheep " for poverty in the industry.
The French Chancellor says that next year there will be a tax cut of more than 10 billion euros and calls on Germany to follow suit.
September 26th, Reuters -- French Chancellor Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros (US$ 10.9 billion) next year, and that Germany should keep pace with French fiscal stimulus in order to revive the troubled economy.
In introducing the French budget for 2020, Le Mel stated that the European Central Bank’s latest monetary easing initiative had created an opportunity to increase investment for the Governments of capable member States.
The ECB reached a record low in interest rates on September 12, and plans to restart its purchase debt in order to lower borrowing costs, in the hope that it will stimulate economic recovery and boost inflation.
" Low interest rates will not allow Europe to prosper again, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough, " Le Mel said to the press.
"Germany needs to invest, it needs to do it now, as soon as possible... and don't wait until things get worse, " he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany many times.
France has implemented tax cuts of over €10 billion this year, which have greatly boosted its economic growth.
And the global economy is losing power, and the German economy, which is dependent on exports, is bearing the brunt.
Le Mel noted that next year the tax burden on French families will be reduced by €9.3 billion, including €5 billion in income tax relief.
In addition, as the corporate tax rate is gradually reduced from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over a five-year period, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost Euro1 billion.

Research: The US National Healthy Diet Index has increased slightly, but still presents challenges - China Net
According to the U.S. News Network, a recent U.S. study has shown that the U.S. Government's healthy diet index has grown moderately over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
But with 100 points, it's not worth celebrating.
American citizens still face a "massive challenge" in their diet.
According to one of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fanfan, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University, Massachusetts, Americans still consume too much food that can cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, all of which are the most common in the United States.
The study was published in the American Medical Association magazine in 24.
The study was based on the findings of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the United States Government from 1999 to 2016 ...
The authors have written that " while there has been considerable improvement, significant dietary challenges persist " .
These challenges are known to include reducing the intake of snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter and other fat-saturated foods by United States nationals.
Research has found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people ' s daily diet has increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, exceeding the recommended 10 per cent limit.
The biggest improvement in the American national diet is the drop in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
Officially, sugar-added intakes should be below 10% in daily diets.
For the reasons for the decrease in sugar intake, researchers believe that it is associated with a reduction in the use of sweet soda, but Zhang Fong stresses that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
The intake of fruits, nuts, oatmeal and other whole grain categories by adults in the United States has increased slightly.
However, data for 2016 show that the proportion of these foods in daily diets is still less than 5%.
Despite a slight decrease in salt intake and low-quality carbohydrate intake as a result of a reduction in the use of juice, Zhang aromatics indicate that they still account for up to 42 per cent of daily heat, many of which come from processed white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on biennial personal health surveys that remind adults of the food they have eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asked twice every few days since 2003.
The Government has issued a dietary guide for United States residents recommending a " healthy dietary model " to reduce the risk of chronic illness.
The guide states that people should consume more nutrient-intensive foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, thin meat, poultry meat, eggs, seed food that can provide protein.
At the time of the study, the number of people with diabetes in the United States almost doubled to over 7%, and obesity has also increased over the years – now about 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among United States nationals.
EU promotes strategic partnerships with Asia
Member of the Central Political Bureau of the Viet Nam Communist Party, Secretary of the Central Registry, and Minister of the Central Economy, Nguyen Wenping, led the meeting.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the Forum was " Towards a European Union-Asia Interface: Building Bridges for the Future of Sustainable Development " .
The forum was held one year after the implementation of the twinning strategy in the two continents of the European Union.
The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, stated that the strengthening of the interface was part of the above-mentioned idea, as it brought benefits to the peoples and economies of the countries concerned.
These relationships help bring stability and prosperity to all concerned.
At the same time, he believed that the European Union wanted to convey a message about increasing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial interface between Europe and Asia ...
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is a special guest at the Forum and will make a major address in the plenary.
The country's first equity company, a financial subsidiary, has been set up to run its business with technology.
In Qingdao, a fully-owned subsidiary of the Grand Bank was formally established in Qingdao as the first stock-based bank finance subsidiary of the country.
Experts indicated that asset management was an important area for the development of financial science and technology, and that banks had established financial subsidiaries to enable them to use science and technology to upgrade their operations.
In April this year, Kwang Da Bank, the recruiter bank, issued a separate announcement that it had been approved by the China Silver Insurance Supervisory Board to prepare for the construction of the finance subsidiary.
On September 24, Gwang Da Bank announced that he had been officially authorized to open his own business.
Just two days later, Kwang Da took the lead in a number of stock-based banks and took the lead in setting up Kwang Dynasty in Qingjia.
The Chairman of the Big Light Group, Lee Xiaoping, said that the Big Light Group would accelerate the pace of innovation by using modern technological thinking and tools, relying on big data, material networking, cloud computing, increasing the coverage of financial capital, utilization and penetration rates, improving customer access, happiness and security.
By 2021, the " eight pillars " of sound financial science and technology development will be established in order to further strengthen the capacity of the financial sector to apply science and technology, achieve greater integration of finance and technology, coordinate development, and significantly increase the population ' s satisfaction with digitalization, networking and intelligent financial products and services.
Mr. Zhang Xuyang, Chairman of Xuyang Finance, introduced the idea that the Xujiang financial platform would use such techniques as intellectual investment, intellectual investment, big data, etc. to help Quinoto better determine the macroeconomic situation.
New technologies, such as block chains, will also be applied in the future to capture trends and trends from traditional to alternative to digitally alternative assets.
According to Dong Ji-hoon, a special researcher at the National Financial and Development Laboratory (NFDL), in the face of an entirely new competitive situation in the financial sector, IFC and IFC will explore new growth paths using IFS together.
Financial science and technology empowerment is both a need for financial science and technology to transform itself and a need to breathe new life and dynamism into financial and business development.
At the beginning of this year, Kyoto Digital Science and Technology launched a new technology management system to enhance the capacity of capital-based product R & D and wind control through technology and digitalization.
The new system starts with product design, sales transactions, asset management, risk assessment of four major capabilities, and raises the overall intellectual performance of the industry.
Experts believe that while upgrading client service capabilities and innovating rich products, IT can also enhance risk preparedness and efficiency in management.
Zhang Xuyang indicated that while the risk preferences used to locate clients through questionnaires were prone to deviations, the current use of artificial intelligence in the use of user portraits helps to better locate clients and to introduce products in line with their investment preferences helps to mitigate risks.
"Electrators, big data like time and space data can help us better carve out a region, an industry dynamic, a landscape... "
Zhang Xuyang said that while risk is being addressed, big data technology will also help improve wind control.
The deepest record of the Chinese railway tunnels has been updated.
After more than 1,200 days of construction on September 27th, China's new social security mountain (Jan Wei Minh is the nation's leader, Zhou Jingbo), the construction of the Greater Ri (Li) Railway's Sant'Ligon tunnel, well No. 1, was completed on 27th. The well reached a depth of 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the deepest record of Chinese railway tunnels, which were created in a flood of water.
The 34.5-kilometre-long Grand-Swee Railway Golligan Hill Tunnel, located in Yunnan, crosses the Golligan Hills from the West Bank and is the longest double-line single-hole tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel crossed 19 fracture zones at a maximum depth of 1,155 metres, since it covered the undesirable geological and significant risks that could be encountered in almost all tunnel construction, known as the " geological museum " of the tunnel.
The wells are the most important auxiliary tunnels in the Gorlegon Hill Tunnel, with the important task of increasing the operational surface to provide ventilation for the operation of the long-sleeps and later railways.
The successful excavation of the first rig to the bottom of the well marks the construction of the formal entry-level tunnel at the Goligon Hill Tunnel, which, after the bottom of the well is opened and re-equipped, will add four fields of operation to the well to speed up the opening of the tunnel.
" Wells are all over the granite layer, and, because of the fragmentation of the granite layer, they can't stop the water, they don't stop running from the top to the bottom, and basically the depth of the water pressure of the wells is as high ... "
The Chief Engineer of the Dare Railways Project of the Central Iron Tunnel Agency told reporters that during the construction of the well, there had been a number of risks, such as mudslides and collapses, and that the builders had invited experts to go live and over 20 discussions on the treatment programme.
" The maximum influx of water in the wells amounts to more than 300 cubic metres per hour and more than 700 metres of the bottom of the well, with water pressure equal to 700 metres of the sea floor ... "
" If we don ' t pump the drain in time, we'll flood the well 10 meters in an hour, we'll spend almost 85% of our time on water treatment and 15% of our time on digging... "
In order to overcome the geological difficulties of vertically controlled development of the rig 1 fence, slurry, water-rich granite, etc., tunnel construction uses a combination of "exploration, notation, excavation" systems to treat water and reduce the risk of construction.
After several improvements, the construction of the first rig created a system of excavation, a system of suspension, a mechanized stream of water, such as a winch upgrade system, which resulted in eye beating, bursting, shattering, the installation of templates and the construction of concrete, which accelerated the construction process.
Eventually, after more than 1,200 day and night works, the well was successfully constructed at a depth of 762.59 metres.
The Grand-Swee railroad is 330 km long and is an important part of the international corridor in Central Burma and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the "one-way" construction.
With the construction of the car, the travel time between Dalian and Riley will be reduced from 6 hours to 2 hours on the current road, which will significantly improve transport patterns in the Farsi region, and will facilitate trade and financial cooperation between China and South-East Asian countries.

The British tourist car keys fell into the lake, and the whole family was trapped in France for five days.
Recently, a couple from Wales, England, took two children on vacation to France and accidentally threw the car keys into the lake, and the whole family was forced to wait five days to get the new keys from the car manufacturer.
The couple then left France with the children.
It was reported that on 16 September local time, when the British family was looking at a lake in France, her daughter accidentally knocked over a bag and the keys to the car in it fell into the lake.
But they took hours and couldn't find the key.
And all their possessions and cash are locked in the car.
Although British tourists bought insurance before leaving, the insurance company refused to help on the grounds that there was no risk that the vehicle would be stolen.
They had to hire a tow truck to take it to a garage and store it, and then reorder the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, British tourists finally got the right key and the couple left France with the kids.
And their scheduled journey was cancelled by the loss of the car keys.

Pilot notification of commitment systems in areas such as licensing of food production for low-risk varieties, decentralization of foreign business representation to self-trade zones
On 27 September, the Shanghai Municipal Market Regulatory Authority signed a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Pudong Novi District to introduce 20 market regulatory reform measures, some of which were pilot projects throughout the country.
It was stated that notification of the promise meant that the administrative authorities, in matters relating to the registration of permits, had informed the applicant in writing of the conditions and requirements laid down in the laws and regulations, once and for all ...
Once the applicant has signed a promise, the administrative authorities can do it directly.
According to the memorandum of understanding, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority will support the registration of business names in the Pudong New Zone and the Shanghai Free Trade Trial Area, process simple processes, permit the production of food for low-risk varieties, and provide a commitment system in three areas, such as partial metrology equipment type approval, to facilitate business access.
Shanghai Xinjin Live Food Co. Ltd., 27, obtained " food production permits " on the spot by means of a notification of commitment, becoming the first company to benefit from a pilot dividend.
The head of the business said that food permits could also be obtained on the spot and that the "admissibility" approach, which allowed the company to submit part of the information in accordance with the deadline agreed in the declaration of commitment, " had actually felt the ease of the reform... "
Shanghai market regulators have indicated that the system of notification of food production licences is a national pilot.
As a result of the reform, the processing process was reduced from "Registration, Reception, On-Site Verification, Sample Examination, Examination of Materials, Approval of the Six" to "Registration, Reception, Approval of the Certificate" by the previous three sections, from 20 working days prior to the reform to the closure of the case on-the-spot.
Taking into account the high outward orientation of the Pudong economy, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority delegated the registration of the permanent representative of foreign (regional) enterprises to the Shanghai Free Trade Area to facilitate the proximity of enterprises.
Statistics show that the decentralization involved a total of 1,592 permanent representative institutions in the Shanghai Free Trade Area, of which 99 were processed in accordance with the new regulations.
"11" long fake consumer survey: choice of more diversity, tourism first.
National holiday is approaching, and people's vacation plans are being finalized.
The security daily journalist recently launched a small survey in the circle of friends on the 11th holiday arrangements, and almost 20 feedbacks indicate that, although the plans are different, "Tourism + Consumption" is the key word for the 11th holiday.
Specifically, in the feedback received by the Daily Securities Journal, more than half chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said that " during the XI period it was planned to take his family to Shanghai, while Mr. Disney was the first stop and then went to the surrounding cities " ; Ms. Li and her family in Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan, " one family left on September 28th to plan a 10-day tour of the island " ; Ms. Ma in Chongqing planned an exit trip with Singapore as his destination; Mr. Zhang and his family in Hebei chose to go on their own, saying, "The daughter is under two years old, it is not easy to go away, she plans to travel to Shandong and spend a few days on the beach " .
The "Trends of Travel and Travel of the Residents of the Golden Week of 2019" published recently by the same team, shows that this year's Golden Week is marked by an upward trend in consumption in three sub-areas.
Aircraft, high-iron penetration, star hotels, personalized unmarked accommodation needs have risen steadily.
On September 23, the United States Mission published the "Trip Report on Tourism Consumption in the 2019th World" which shows that tourism consumption continues to flourish and that it is becoming more diversified.
More young people travel for high quality, special experiences, cultural tourism, night tourism, and so on.
In addition to tourism, consumer demand was released during the 11th.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the daily security newspaper, "The main plan for this year's 11th is to buy a car."
A Beijing car brand 4S staff said to the Daily Securities reporter that, in general, September and October of each year are known as the golden days of car sales.
During the "XI" period, there will be a lot of events, such as a draw prize, a drop in the shop.
In addition, a number of brands have recently introduced new models, which are expected to have a significant boost to sales.
In the context of rising consumption trends, there is greater emphasis on spiritual demand, culture, and rising consumption of services such as education.
Ms. Doo, who lives in Beijing, said, " Since the birth of a child, culture, education and consumption have become the bulk of household spending ...
This year's 11th is a full year. We're going to the "Catch Card" Planetarium, the Children's Theatre, a few family weekends to camp in tents at the Elk Museum, and we've got some auditions. "
According to the industry, in theory, the population ' s consumption rises along the path of subsistence consumption towards developmental consumption and enjoyment, with a substantial share of the enjoyment consumption falling within the range of service consumption.
As our economy continues to grow and the income levels of the population rise, there is an increasing focus on consumption demand at the spiritual level, and tourism, travel, is a good way to go.
Especially in the long holidays of the 11th, with plenty of time, people are more willing to travel and consume, both to meet the spiritual demand for consumption and as a reflection of rising consumption among the population.

That's the reason for going out.
On the phone, thanks to Nanna's love for your sister, there's no excuse for buying snacks.
They laughed a few times and said the kid was on the phone and hung up.
Nana jumps on the sidewalk, gets down on the ground, she knows she's sick, scared, and she doesn't want to be with me.
It's hard for the husband, Boo, to come back early.
Even the salads of the salmon with the butter are good, and then go to the bedroom and watch TV on the bed.
Look at the wall, it's 7 o'clock, the sun sets early, and it's dark.
It's Mid-Autumn today.
Washed a bunch of grapes from a friend, left half to Boo, and left it in a little bowl of flowers and took out to see the moon.
Sitting on the floor with Nana, and I ate grapes and she ate skins, and I threw up grape seeds far away.
The moon is hidden in the clouds, so that the clouds can walk, the moon will suddenly appear, and the darkness will be a little sharp.
There's a lot of poetry about the moon in my head, and it's only clear: every time you come back, you can't see it until you've had a round of light on the jade fence.
Maybe we've given the moon too much emotion. For me now, in fact, the word of God belongs to God, and Caesar belongs to Caesar.
The moon goes to the moon and the mood goes to you.
After eating the grapes, it's cold and cold.
The Nana Regiment snored slightly by her feet, stood up, laid Nana's little blanket over her little house, and he was happy to be on it.
Open the door and shout: "Are the baths burned?
You can't see the moon from the window of the bathroom. You can only feel the moon. Turn off the lights of the bathroom.
No mooncakes, no drink.

Starting next year, Chinese students can apply for German undergraduate studies on the basis of a high school exam.
In recent days, the Anabin database of Germany, which is responsible for the assessment and certification of foreign qualifications, announced on the Network that starting in 2020, Chinese high school graduates can apply directly for undergraduate studies at German universities on the basis of their high school results and do not need to be enrolled first at domestic universities.
Prior to that, Chinese high school graduates who wanted to apply to German universities had to study a semester (211,985) or three (general) semesters in their country, and passed the APS or the Tests of Testas.
The release of the new regulations may save Chinese students who wish to study in Germany at least six months.
It is known that the new regulations will enter into force in the second half of 2019.
Applicants are required to: complete 12 years of regular compulsory education with a certificate of high school graduation; take part in the examination, higher examination, with grades of 70% and above of the total score (up to 525 points if a total score of 750 points) and include two language and one mathematics or natural science achievement requirements.

In the United Kingdom, for example, the universities of Cambridge, Birmingham, Lester, etc., accept Chinese students applying for high school results.
Military "Machine Dogs" first in the acting class.
The U.S. Army has funded the development of a "machine dog" for the battlefield, and now it's probably more likely to be on the circus stage!
The Sun Circus has recently indicated that it is in contact with Boston Dynamics, which develops robots, to discuss the feasibility of robot applications for circus performances.
In a comprehensive foreign media report, Boston Power Technology published a promotional film entitled "Spot, a four-foot robot" on 24th, which shows that Spot is an agile mobile robot with a 14-kilogram capacity with high mobility for off-road terrain, 360 degrees of shelter, navigation, remote control and autonomy.
In particular, Spot has a proprietary software platform specifically developed for Spot, which allows users to set their own Spot robotic functions through a variety of applications.
Boston Dynamics first published the idea of a machine dog in 1992, which caused a sensation, but still has not been really used in commercial applications.
However, according to Boston Dynamics, Spot is now in the mass production phase, with a majority of buyers predominantly in buildings and energy industry.
In addition, the Sun Circus is currently in contact with Boston Power Technology, which says that the plan is still in the conceptual stage and is assessing Spot ' s potential for use at the performance site.

According to the White Paper, China has spent decades through the hundreds of years of development in the developed world, with its economy rising to the second highest level in the world, with nearly 1.4 billion people emerging from material shortages, generally at a level of well-being and enjoying unprecedented dignity and rights.
The White Paper stresses that for 70 years, the Chinese people have come home with nothing but self-reliance, struggle and struggle to create a new world; for 70 years, China has developed in its interaction with the world, embraced the world, learned the world and contributed to it; for 70 years, China has contributed to world peace and given impetus to the common development of nations.
The White Paper states that China ' s development has been successful over the past 70 years because, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the right path to development of the socialism of the Chinese identity and are steadfast in their pursuit of that path.
The White Paper stresses that the path of socialism of China ' s identity is a path based on national circumstances, a path that places the interests of the people at the forefront, a path of reform and innovation, a path of common development in openness, and a path towards a State based on the rule of law in all its aspects.

Will Marv be elected to a by-election at the conference in Denver, South Africa, and Elephant?
The President of the Ma'am, Mr. Datos Li, said: " Let's talk to the Supreme Council of the National Front! "
In the immediate run-up to the Eichian by-election, the question was raised whether Ma Wah of the Fretilin party would take part in the traditional national race.
However, after a meeting of the MCFC, it was announced that the Supreme Council of the National Front would decide whether to continue to place the Mawar in the ranks or in the place of the other members of the party.
On Thursday afternoon, after chairing the meeting of the Madhua Central Committee, Wei said to the media that any by-election would be conducted in accordance with the standard operating procedures (SOP), i.e., only after a meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front.
He said that since the Election Commission would meet only next Monday (1 January) to finalize the By-elections for the Danfumi State Seat, the meeting of the Supreme Council of the Fretilin was expected to take place in early October.
" Yesterday morning, I also met with the President of the National Front, Dato ' Seri Amalzahi, and we all agreed on the need to regain this seat from the Alliance of Hope... "
" We have finalized the convening of a meeting of the leaders of the Special National Front in early October, at which the leaders of the three parties of the National Front will determine which of their members will take part ... "
Asked if Mawar would insist on his traditional position to the Supreme Council of the National Front, Wei Jiaxiang reiterated that, as Chairman of the Ma Wah General, he must act in accordance with the standard operating procedures, and that any decision must therefore be taken by consensus of the National Front.
"In any by-election, it's a common thing for people to be willing to march, for political parties, for someone to think that they should come out... "
"The most important thing is what kind of organization and political alliance we're from?"
"This is a great test of our political union over the years, and we believe that the National Front has come along with some valuable values... "
"In the process, someone might say something, which is not surprising. "
" But once the Supreme Council of the National Front has made a decision, we must all be ready to fight, which is the most valuable... "
In any case, Wei Jiaxiang has indicated that Ma Wah will be fully engaged in preparing for the upcoming By-election for the Danfon-Ai seat on three levels, namely the District Council, the State Council and the Central Committee.
" The district council will be headed by the chairman of the district council (Danflebai) and the state board by the chairman of the council of juju will be led by the director of the board of directors of the council of Juju, and the central council will be deployed by the chief minister of the board of directors, Dato ' Mahan and the general secretary, in person, by the director of the board of directors, Mr. Zhang....

Last Saturday, Congressman Danfly of the Indigenous Solidarity Party, Nadhu Mohammed Fari, died in a government hospital in stupid Jane, 42 years old.
A villager in Bachong County, Hubei, was ordered to hunt wild animals.
A villager in Paikang County, Hubei, was sentenced for hunting wildlife and ordered to compensate him for the cost of repairing environmental damage to the ecological resources in the amount of 15420 yuan (RMB).
Due to the indigence of the accused ' s family, the Public Prosecution Service introduced alternative forms of labour to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration, thereby achieving an organic harmonization of legal and social effects.
On 27 September, the Deputy Attorney-General of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Paikang County, Wang Chong Liang, introduced the alternative work of three months' "compulsory patrol of the mountain", in which the accused had developed deep feelings with wild monkeys and was deeply responsible for previous animal hunting.
On 21 June of this year, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural District filed a civil pro bono lawsuit in the area of ecological resources, which was heard in the District Court and handed down in court.
The defendant was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment, four years ' probation and a fine of $3,000, and was ordered to compensate him for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources in the amount of $15420.
According to the survey, starting in late January 2014, a power grid was installed on the cliffs, hunting for over 20 wildlife species, including falcons, pelicans, fur crown deer, etc.
The falcons are second-tier endangered wildlife conservation animals, small puppies, and the macaw deer is listed on the national list of terrestrial wildlife conservation.
During the trial, Zhou confessed to his wrongs and conduct and was willing to assume subsidiary civil liability.
However, in view of the poor economic situation of a certain family in the past week, the local village council, the forest station, coordinated by the Prefectural Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural Department, concluded an agreement on the cost of alternative labour compensation for ecological restoration, which is provided by the three parties of the same week, i.e., for the care of monkeys in the village ' s monkey reserve, for the compulsory patrol of mountains, for one year of forest protection, and for the provision of public goods to cover the cost of ecological restoration.
In response to the prosecutor's recommendation, the court accepted that the duty of "alternative labour to compensate for ecological restoration costs" should be actively met while the suspended sentence would be carried out on a weekly basis.
At the moment, Joao has been on duty for three months in the Monkey Reserve, and has been active and performing well on the mountain.
In recent years, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural District of Pavcon has integrated the prosecution function and the conduct of social governance in practice, using the recommendations of the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, investigative supervision, prosecution supervision and other forms of supervision to minimize the ecological damage caused by criminal acts through judicial means ...
The United Nations awards the Earthguard prize for the ant forest.
In a warm round of applause and resounding music, the head of the Ant Forest project, Xu Hae, and the user representative Shen Hsiang went to the podium and received from the moderator the 2019 United Nations Champion of the Earth award.
In 2019, the Earthguard award ceremony was held in New York, United States of America, on the 26th of which the "Incentive and Action" award was awarded to hundreds of millions of people involved in the "Ant Forest" project of environmental action.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced its winning list at its headquarters in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, but the people who took part in the award ceremony on that day were still very excited.
In an interview with a Xinhua journalist, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Ingae Anoxen, said that the Ant Forest was an exciting innovation that had mobilized hundreds of millions of people to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans could do about the environment.
It connects people and the environment with technology and allows each individual to participate in actions to protect the Earth, which will have a huge impact.
The Ant Forest was launched by the Chinese Ants Financial Services Group in August 2016 on a payout platform, where users accumulated "green energy" through low-carbon actions such as online payments for electricity and water, and "tree planting" on mobile phones.
Every time a user grows a virtual tree, ant forest and a public good partner plant a real tree in a deserted area.
By August of this year, 500 million "ant forest" users had accumulated 7.92 million tons of carbon emissions and 122 million trees planted in areas of desertification.
In the same day's Earthguard award, Costa Rica was awarded a prize for national environmental efforts, and the President of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado, paid tribute to the contribution of the Ant Forest on the spot, "to inspire so many people to participate in green action and to be impressed " .
The president and CEO of the ant-coat, Kenji Ii, said that the Earthguard award was an affirmation of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for people to participate in low-carbon life, an honour that belongs to all participants.
Ii Kenjung said that the ant forest has affected 500 million people over the past three years and that the objective of the ant forest over the next three years is to engage 1 billion people around the world in low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase farmers ' income from green water in the mountains.
In addition to providing employment through tree planting, it is hoped that farmers will be helped to achieve higher incomes through agricultural development projects, power-marketing platforms, etc.
The pro bono model created by the Ant Forest, based on digital technology, has also successfully gone out to sea and has been drawn upon by other countries.
Last June, the largest electronic wallet in the Philippines, GCash, launched the Philippine version of the Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon livelihoods.
It was stated that GCash, in partnership with the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, the Environmental Public Interest Organization, among others, was planning to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the start of the project.
The Earthguard Award is the highest United Nations award in the field of environmental protection and is awarded once a year.
The Ant Forest was awarded the "Incentive and Action Award" for the third consecutive year of the Green Innovation Project from China, following the construction of the Sihan Dams in China, the Chijiang Province of China, the "Kimura Village Model" project.
Trade friction affects the U.S. economy.
The United States Economic Report Card for the second quarter of this year showed a marked slowdown in the growth of the United States gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the previous quarter, as a result of a sharp decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts have pointed out that economic friction and the uncertainty it creates are the main causes of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data published by the United States Department of Commerce on 26 February showed that US GDP grew by 2 per cent at annual rates in the second quarter, which was the same as the previously published revised data, but was significantly lower than 3.1 per cent in the first quarter.
The data show that consumer growth is a major factor underpinning the growth of the United States economy in the second quarter.
Individual consumption expenditure, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the total United States economy, increased by 4.6 per cent in the current season, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government spending on consumption and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment declined by 6.3 per cent in the second quarter over the previous quarter, delaying growth by 1.16 percentage points; exports by 5.7 per cent over the previous quarter, and net exports by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, Managing Partner, Einsard Macroeconomic Consulting, United States, stated that not only did private sector investment not maintain the momentum of last year ' s growth, but it declined significantly because of the impact on business confidence caused by economic friction and rising uncertainty.
Knap believes that, under the influence of policy uncertainty, US corporate capital spending is expected to continue to decline next year.
According to analysts, while consumption growth has strongly supported the United States economy in the second quarter, there are increasing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty that they bring have affected consumer confidence and negatively affected the United States consumption prospects ...
The head of the survey, Richard Courting, Professor of Economics at the University of Michigan, had recently stated that, in a recent survey, 38 per cent of consumers had referred spontaneously to the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, which was a new high in a year and a half.
For the future of the US economy, analysts generally agree that the US economy will continue to slow down.
However, the view was also expressed that the performance of the United States industrial sector and financial markets would improve if economic friction were eased.
The global economist, Karin Burch, of the British Economist think tank, predicts that in the future the United States economy will continue its downward trend since this year and will increase at a much lower rate than in the second quarter.
The chief economist of Moody's Analysis Company, Mark Zandy, predicts that the economy of the United States will grow by 2.3 per cent this year and will slow down further to 1.6 per cent next year, assuming that the economic friction will not continue to escalate.
According to Ellen Hazen, the investment manager of Patnam Investment Corporation, the biggest concern of the current enterprise is the economic and trade dispute and the uncertainty it creates, which, if resolved, would be significantly reduced, and the industrial sector would perform much better than it is now.
According to Matt Melley, the stock strategist of Miller-Tabak Asset Management, trade friction remains a " top problem " and is the main cause of this year ' s significant volatility in United States capital markets, and whether it can be properly addressed will be key to influencing the direction of United States capital markets for the rest of the year.
The first couple in Ningxia can take 10 days of parental leave per year for children between the ages of 0 and 3
Guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important sign of the progress of civil society.
On 27 September, at the fifteenth session of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth People ' s Congress of the Ningxia Autonomous Region, the Regulations on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in the Ningxia Autonomous Region were adopted with a high vote.
This is a comprehensive and systematic local regulation for the legal protection of women ' s rights and interests, enacted by the first province of Ningxia, which will be in force as of 1 November 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations adopted on this occasion were amended on the basis of the 2007 Ningxia approach to the implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women, divided into nine chapters, 65 articles, including general provisions, political rights, cultural and educational rights and interests, labour and social security rights and interests, property rights and interests, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal responsibilities and by-laws.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encouraged the exploration of joint parental leave for couples, which was the first in the country.
In April of this year, the State Department's Office issued a "Guidance to Promote the Development of Child Care Services for Children under the age of 3" which describes the joint care of couples.
In the process of amending the Regulations, Ningxia introduced an innovative proposal to " encourage employers to grant 10 days of parental leave each year between the ages of 0 and 3 for couples with children in accordance with the law " .
At the same time, the Ordinance highlights the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations, which incorporates the latest legislative results in China's current civil code on personality rights, details the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms against sexual harassment.
Section 44 of the Ordinance expressly prohibits the frequent incidence of sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to provide relevant education, protection and prevention as a new standard for the protection of girls in local legislation.
With regard to the right of women to know and dispose of the common property of the matrimonial family, article 35 of the Ordinance clearly establishes the right of women to know the joint property and the obligations of the property register and related entities, providing solid institutional support for women ' s rights.
In addition, in response to the social issue of gender discrimination in employment, article 26 of the Ordinance prohibits not only direct discrimination but also indirect discrimination, and draws on the latest experience of joint interview practice to strengthen penalties for gender-based discrimination violations and to strengthen the defence of women's legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the work of the Ningxia Women ' s Federation, the Joint Public Prosecution Division, civil affairs, etc., in promoting and introducing the participation of social and professional forces in the mediation of marital and family disputes and in the fight against domestic violence has been very effective.
The Regulations summarize and promote this by encouraging the mobilization of social forces and the pooling of social resources for the common defence of women's rights and interests in a number of laws and by requiring the people's governments at and above the county level to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support, including through the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia, the UNITA Yuanlong Pilgrim station is saline rice-resistant.
The journalist was informed by the UNITA Administration Administration of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on 27th that the "Saline-resistant rice site of the UNITA Yuan Long Pilgrim Station" recently held by the Alliance had been uploaded with good news that the average acre production of saline rice had broken down by 1,000 pounds.
A team of six experts from the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences of Heilongjiang Province, Yangzhou University and the Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Hunan Province conducted a sampling of the Salt Series rice harvest on site.
According to expert assessment, the average acre production of saline rice amounted to 508.8 kg on a pH value of 8.8 to 9.6, with salt content of 5 to 6 per 1,000.
" We intend to build on this year ' s experiment and to innovate and reform the development and optimization of salt-resistant rice varieties to make them better of quality and production... "
" With no change in the factors of production, I believe that the continued intensification of the technological offensive will continue to produce miracles on the saline ... " , said the researcher, Vice-President of the Agricultural Academy of Heilongjiang Province, who is the head of the Group of Experts on Production Measurements.
UNITA is part of a conglomerate of special hardship areas.
In October 2018, Yuan Long Pilgrim worked for UNITA to show up.
Master Yuan led a team of experts to speed up the introduction of the newly developed "salin-resistant hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technologies, build 960 acres of salin-resistant rice bases in the right-wing flag of Kordem, use side tests and technology routes to boost the productivity of the local poor and lift them out of poverty.
This on-site production of salt-resistant rice not only injects hope into the upgrading of UNITA salt-based low- and middle-yielding fields to middle- and high-yielding fields, but also provides a scientific basis for salt-based rice cultivation under the same conditions in the country.
According to the Australian Network, the new state of Australia passed the legalisation of abortion bill on 26 September, local time, after a marathon debate and weeks of protests.
It is known that the bill has generated political debate over the past eight weeks and that there have been serious differences within the AFP since the independent member of Parliament Greenwich announced its introduction.
It was reported that, after nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australasia Senate passed the legalisation of abortion bill on the night of 25 by 26 votes to 14, making it the third-long bill to be considered by the new State Senate.
26 a.m. legalized abortion in the new state after a final vote in the House of Representatives of the new state.
The Act allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy on the 22nd week of pregnancy and, with the consent of two doctors, to have an abortion later in pregnancy.
An amendment was passed by the Senate on the evening of 25th, whereby doctors can seek advice from the Multidisciplinary Group of the Hospital Advisory Committee before performing an abortion for a woman after the 22nd week of pregnancy.
In addition, the amendments adopted by the Senate include the need for doctors to provide appropriate care for babies who survive termination of pregnancy.
Prior to that, the Governor of the new state, Berrijiklyn, had faced public criticism from conservatives on the bill and had intervened many times to buy more time for debate on the bill, but she had not been present at the final vote.
" I need time to run the whole new state... "
Congressman Davis of the AFP was known to have been the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatened to withdraw from the new state government and claimed that the bill had triggered a " government crisis " .
But then Davis gave in.
Davis said: " The content of the amendment to the bill on the legalization of abortion submitted to the House of Representatives in the morning of 26 provides more guarantees for women and doctors ... "
Meanwhile, Bari Laro, leader of the New Australian National Party, said he was proud to be a member of the government that legalized abortion.
"What we achieved last night is historic for the new state, and it decriminalizes abortion, which is no longer a crime, nor treats an abortion woman as a criminal... "

In 2017, the State Council issued the " Transfer of a Part of the State Capital Fund for Social Security Implementation Programme " , which called for the selection of selected central enterprises and selected provinces for piloting.
According to Liu Quin, the transfer process has yielded positive results.
At the central level, three batches of conversions of 67 central enterprises and financial institutions were completed, totalling approximately 86.1 billion yuan in State capital.
Of these, the transfer of central financial institutions in which the Ministry of Finance performs the functions of funder has been largely completed.
Central business transfer has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, the pre-transfer of enterprises has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces had been largely completed, transferring State-owned capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, preparatory work has been carried out successively in other provinces to prepare for the next transfer.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the National Finance Committee, the General Tax Administration and the CSRC, the central and local transfer of part of the State capital to the SWF was fully opened in 2019 and will be substantially completed by 2020.
The meeting that took place on that day made a concrete deployment for the full rollover.
It was emphasized that the transfer should be accomplished pragmatically and efficiently.
"According to the schedule, the transfer is to be substantially completed by 2020...
The transfer of working hours is tight and the task is heavy ... "
Liu Quin said that in the regions, departments should be well organized and well organized to ensure that the transfer was completed as required; work should be carried forward in a solid manner to accurately capture the content of the transfer policy; and communication coordination should be strengthened to resolve difficult issues in a timely manner.
The transfer of state funds to the SWF — from the point of departure of the SWF money bag, the destination is to provide strong support for old-age security.
But I think it's not a simple "physical shift" of equity, it's a "mathematical addition."
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Welfare, the State Finance Committee, the General Tax Administration, the CSRC jointly issued a " Notice on the Full Transfer of Part of the State Capital for the Work of the Fund for Social Security " , setting out a timetable for the conversion of the State capital to the Fund, i.e., the Central and Local Transfer of Part of the State Capital for the Work of the Fund for Social Security for the Full Implementation of the Fund in 2019.
After the documents were published, departments such as the Ministry of Finance were able to implement them quickly.
On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10 per cent of the holdings of business and industry banks, agricultural banks, to the Social Security Fund, with a total transfer value of more than $115 billion.
Under the terms of the Act, subjects such as the Social Security Foundation, as financial investors, enjoy the right to gain, dispose of and know the shares allocated to the State.
In its announcement, the Bank of Agriculture stated that the change in interest would not result in a change in the shareholders and actual owners of the Bank.
In response, I believe that similar State-owned equity transfers are not simple changes in the attribution of equity, but rather "additional calculations " that trigger a range of effects.
The "plus results " of the first step in the transfer of some State funds to social security are naturally the expression of the universal ownership of State-owned enterprises and the universal sharing of development results.
After many years of reform and development, State enterprises, especially the United States, are mostly in important sectors and areas of our economy, with greater and more stable overall profitability.
Among them, the leading business is more capable of doing good on an ongoing basis.
On 10 July, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided that the transfer of part of the State capital to the Social Security Fund would be fully implemented this year.
The Ministry of Finance then indicated that, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Committee of the State Council, it would complete the transfer of part of the State capital to the Social Security Fund, fully reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the universal sharing of the results of State enterprise development.
The second step of the transfer, "Additional results " , is to enhance the sustainability of our social security fund and further strengthen the foundations of the social security system for old age.
With the ageing population, the country ' s social security funds are under pressure, and most of the national funds that have been transferred this time have the ability to sustain profits and dividends, not only to effectively replenish the social security funds, but also to provide a source of living water for the social security funds.
Measurements show that a reduction of 1 percentage point in the contribution rate to the enterprise ' s basic pension insurance is supported for every 3.8 percentage points of State-owned capital transferred.
The third step of the transfer, "plus results", is to add stabilizers to capital markets.
The way the transfer is reaped by the recipient is by "sharing the profits, operating as an aid".
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor in State capital, does rely on the proceeds of equity dividends.
However, the Social Security Fund, as a value investor in capital markets, has a strong capital capacity.
For publicly listed assets of State capital, the participation of the Social Security Fund in the holding of shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, contribute to upgrading the level of business and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets ...
At the same time, the Social Security Fund, as a signpost for investment, has increased its shareholding weight, which has helped to further enhance its influence in the market and to act as a stabilizer in the market.
In addition, it facilitates the full use of the "value discovery" function of institutional investors, leading investors to invest rationally, to invest in value.
Karl Hartmann went to the Leipzig School of Music at the age of 18 and was later trained from Weberburn.
After the Nazis came to power, Hartmann first resisted in the form of works not published in Germany, and then even stopped writing.
In 1933, he created the Miserae and dedicated it to my long-sleeping friends.
In 1935, this symphony was inaugurated in Prague, but was harassed by Nazi bureaucrats.
After that, Hartmann decided not to play any of his works under Nazi rule.
Hartmann's funeral concert was a violin and string concerto, when the manuscript was stolen from Germany and the opening was held in Switzerland.
Please listen to the funeral concert of the Berne House Orchestra at the Beethoven Music Festival in 2018.
The United States Senate approved Scalia as Minister of Labour, Xinhuanet.
Xinhua Society, Washington, D.C., on September 26th, the Senate of the United States voted on President Trump's nomination of Eugene Scalia as Minister of Labour.
The result was 53 votes in favour and 44 against, and no Democrat voted in favour of Scalia.
The Republicans believe that Scalia's curriculum vitae makes him a perfect minister of labour.
But it seems to the Democrats that Scalia has long stood against workers and unions in her legal career.
Scalia will replace Alexander Acosta.
The then Minister of Labour, Acosta, resigned in July of this year under great pressure from public opinion because of the "massive treatment " of Jeffrey Eppstein, the billionaire of the United States who was accused of sexual assault and trafficking of young girls.
Scalia, aged 56, is a partner in a well-known law firm in the United States, and his father is Antonin Scalia, the late Chief Justice of the United States Federal Supreme Court.
The Department of Labor is a cabinet-level department of the United States federal government in charge of labour-related matters, etc.
The White House also issued a statement on the same day that Trump had nominated Peter Guena, Acting Director of the Federal Emergency Response Agency, to head the agency.
In accordance with the procedure, Guena's nomination has to be approved by the Senate of the National Assembly.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of the United States Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for coordinating federal government resources to deal with emergencies such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks and their follow-up in the United States.
Since the first military parade on the thirty-fifth anniversary of the National Day, each major parade has seen a strategic missile force with a giant no-man's wing.
"This national day is the first time that a rocket army has come to light after the army's conversion. "
The commander of the rocket-armed squadron, Wang Bo, said...
The missile-visited forces are fully equipped with special hardship, combat skills, dedication, discipline, scientific formation, training, three main features, a good image of strategic forces, and a more rigorous approach.
During this parade, both generals and soldiers were strictly required to act in a manner that was not permitted.
They also focus on the spirit of the craftsmen, grasping every detail, practicing persistence, practicing style, forming the character of "arming up, moving quickly, answering loudly" and constantly building a martial arts missile array, with a greater focus on technological innovation.
The rocket army as a high-tech strategic army, science and technology, innovation are good traditions and advantages.
This military parade, based on past experience, breaks the mindset, breaks the traditional approach, uses satellite positioning, laser ranging, high-level imaging, real-time speed measurement, and improves the level of training and quality efficiency, and ensures that human vehicles are integrated in a single fraction of the size, that the teams operate in a single second, and that they are more responsive to operational standards.
The rocket corps are subject to the same standards as the military parade and launch sites, with higher demands, to keep every gate close to every detail, to keep the troops under fire, and to make the national parade a real training ground and a test ground to enhance the force ' s ability to fight.
Iran has been confirmed to be developing advanced centrifuges to suspend further the implementation of the Iran nuclear agreement.
According to the Central News Agency, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on 26 September that Iran had once again violated its nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifugal mechanisms to enrich uranium.
Iran is reported to be gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran nuclear agreement in response to the withdrawal of President Trump from the Iran nuclear agreement in May 2018 and the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran ...
Iran suspended two other commitments in July to keep its enriched uranium stock below 300 kg and to keep its enriched uranium in a purity of no more than 3.67%, and now there is a further move.
In accordance with the nuclear agreement, Iran has been able to build only about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, and has allowed Iran to use a small number of more advanced types of aircraft for research, but not to produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for the production of nuclear bombs.
According to the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency: " On 25 September, the Agency confirmed that Iran ' s advanced centrifuges of type 2, 3 R & D were accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium ... "
The report was presented to Member States on 26th by the International Atomic Energy Agency of the United Nations, and a diplomatic official responded: " They are busy at the Natanz enrichment facility ... "

The first hundred-degree autopilot taxi squads started a test operation.
Yesterday, 100 degrees announced in Changsha that the autopilot Robotaxi pilot operation was officially opened.
The first 45 "Red Flag EV" Robotasi, developed by Apollo in conjunction with a red flag, are now operational on the open test section of Changsha.
From this day onward, ordinary Changsha citizens can access the Apollo network to apply for seed users and have an opportunity to experiment with the experience.
One experienced passenger said he was in the back of the vehicle, clicking on the passenger seat front screen, and one key opened the autopilot.
In the vehicle, for the safety of passengers and for the sake of current policy and regulations, the pilot vehicle is equipped with a safety officer in the driver ' s seat to maximize the safety of passengers.
During the course of the journey, vehicles can make intelligent diversions depending on the condition of the road, and they can also determine the condition of the surrounding vehicle and make automatic concessions, such as in cases of proximity.
Throughout the experience, the passenger area screens show in real time the pedestrians, cars, and even some traditional blind areas.
Even when a vehicle is blocked, you can see in advance changes in the red light and waiting times. All traffic conditions are clear.
Unmanned people have heard it on television before, thinking it's far away from us, but finding it in our lives today is amazing.
We look forward to its true entry into civilian life in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo received 45 human test plates issued by the Changsha municipality.
At present, Changsha's autopilot tests open roads, passing through the city's City of Artificial Intelligence City, Lake May Creek, Lake Ocean, Grand Wangshan, High New Zone, etc., reaching 135 km, with a demonstration area of 70 square kilometres, is the longest, largest, most complex of the country's roads, and the most advanced intelligent driving demonstration area with a vehicle-collaborative infrastructure.
It is expected that by the end of 2019, the Apollo Robotaxi convoy will cover approximately 50 km of the test operating road in Changsha, with plans to cover 135 km of the road currently open in Changsha in the first half of 2020.
There's still a problem with the women's platoon winning the game: it's hard to beat a strong team with so many mistakes.
In the afternoon of Beijing time 27, the Chinese women's club celebrated the ninth round of the 2019 women's World Cup against the strong Dutch women's team, and finally the Chinese women's row 3:1 over the Dutch women's team, and the women's team won the 9th World Cup.
But after the game, Coach Ping, the female platoon leader, expressed his dissatisfaction with the team's performance in the third round.
"The third round is more aggressive than the other side, and some of us can't hit the ball without it, and we've made a lot of mistakes. "
"To fight with the strong, you've made so many mistakes, it's hard..."
He said after the interview,
"We say to the team to focus, and when the story is not in place, we're going to take the re-attack, and we're going to fight each other. "
Ruan-pyung also commented on Chang-ning's performance, saying she had some difficulties in the attack, was anxious, too eager to kill the ball, and her movements were deformed.
Let's hope she's patient, "Let's protect her " .
China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
White Paper: China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
The White Paper states that China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
According to the White Paper, as China ' s combined national power and international influence grew rapidly, some people at the international level feared that China would follow the path of "the powerful" and some raised the so-called "China threat theory".
This is both cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalance due to the strength to grow, and deliberate distortion in defence of its vested interests.
Achieving national prosperity, national renewal and the well-being of the people is both a dream of the Chinese people and a common dream of all peoples.
" China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world ... "
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of economic growth in the world, that China is the largest contributor to economic growth in the world, that technological innovation in China has injected new energy into economic growth in the world, and that the future role of the stabilizer and engine in the Chinese economy is even more prominent.
The current world economy is under-powered, and a robust Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to the world.
China ' s economy is moving from high-growth to high-quality development, with new types of industrialization, informatization, urbanization, accelerated modernization of agriculture, deep structural adjustment of the economy, sustained upgrading of industrial excellence, and the emergence of new economic growth points.
" The study of the McKinsey Global Institute found that by 2040, China ' s integration with the rest of the world ' s economies was expected to generate an economic value of $22 trillion to $37 trillion, equivalent to 15 per cent - 26 per cent of the global economy, and that closer cooperation between the rest of the world ' s economies and China would create enormous economic value ... "
The White Paper stressed that China ' s economy and the world economy had undergone structural changes and were deeply integrated.
China, with a more stable economy, a higher quality of growth and a promising growth outlook, is a long-term benefit to the world economy.
Considering China ' s economic development as a "threat" and "challenge " , trying to squeeze China out of global industrial chains, supply chains, value chains, and delinking China from the world economy is unfeasible and harmful.
The White Paper states that openness in all its aspects creates more opportunities for countries to share the "China dividend".
China is steadfast in pursuing a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy to achieve greater and higher levels of openness to the outside world, with China having the world's most potential consumer markets, and China being the most attractive destination for investment, with larger-scale "go-out" benefiting more countries.
"Openness should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, one-way.
Mutually beneficial two-way approach can be long-term ... "
The White Paper states that China is committed to sustained expansion of imports, liberalization of market access, improvement of the business environment and enhancement of intellectual property protection, and that other countries should expand their openness and take corresponding steps to improve their business environment.
It is only by working together that an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment can be created, and the "cake" of development can be made bigger and a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests can be created.
The White Paper states that China provides the international community with more public goods ...
This includes the promotion of a high-quality " one-way " , the establishment of multilateral platforms for dialogue and cooperation, active participation in international and regional affairs, and active foreign assistance.
" China has benefited from the international community ' s development, and has always given back to the family of nations to provide the international community with more and better public goods ... "
The General Manager of the Russian Export Centre, Andrei Slepniov, in a recent written interview with a Xinhua journalist, expressed Russia ' s willingness to strengthen cooperation with China in the field of economics and trade, further optimize its export structure and promote the diversification of Russian exports to China.
Slepniov pointed out that in Russian exports to China, forestry, mechanical manufacturing and chemical industries account for a significant proportion, while agricultural exports are also important, including oil and fat products, meat and dairy products, cereals, fish and seafood.
In recent years, Russian exports of non-materials and non-energy products to China have also shown good and steady development.
Referring to the optimal Russian export structure to China, Slepniov said that the Russian side had set a mandate to expand exports of high-tech products to meet the demand for high-technology products from countries and regions around the world, including China.
The Russian side will then improve financial and non-financial support measures to promote the growth of high-tech enterprises.
The Russian Federation has expressed its willingness to export construction technology and high-tech construction materials to China and to develop cooperation with China in areas such as medicine and aviation manufacturing.
Russia and China also have great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russian products in many areas had a "quality advantage and price competitiveness" over similar products in the West.
Referring to the two countries ' goal of achieving $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2024, Slepniov said that areas such as agriculture, machinery manufacturing, the chemical industry and forestry would play an important role in achieving that goal.
The Russian side intends to contribute to the diversification of supply in these areas and to the export of highly processed products.
He stressed that the Russian side intended to push its exporters into the global value-added chain, in which China was one of the directions of development.
Russian manufacturers in agriculture, metallurgy, petroleum gas and chemicals are well placed to participate in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises by " establishing more joint Russian-Chinese ventures and jointly developing exports to third countries " .
Slepniov indicated that the Russian Export Centre, through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank, was undertaking a variety of measures and services to support exports of Russian products to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Centre will continue to deepen its cooperation with the relevant Chinese authorities in order to promote easier access for Russian goods to the Chinese market and to develop new types of exports to China.
The growth of financial institutions worldwide using the renminbi has been remarkable.
SWIFT's 26th update in London, "The renminbi tracking special", shows a clear trend in the global growth of financial institutions paying in the renminbi from July 2017 to July 2019.
At the Global Banking Financial Telecommunication Association (SWIFT) 2019 London Annual Conference, the agency published a special journal called "The renminbi tracker from the London Perspective" which showed that the number of financial institutions worldwide paying in the renminbi had increased by 11.31 per cent from July 2017 to 2214 from 1989.
Of these, the largest increase was in the number of financial institutions in Africa and the Middle East paying in renminbi, from 143 in July 2017 to 173 in July 2019, an increase of 20.98 per cent.
According to the report, as of August 2019, the renminbi ' s share in the global currency of payment was 2.22 per cent.
At the same time, London plays the lead sheep in currency transactions off the coast of the renminbi.
According to the report, in July 2019, London ' s share of the global renminbi offshore foreign exchange transaction was 33.79 per cent, leading the world.
According to the report, London ranks first in global foreign exchange transactions.
In July 2019, London ' s share in global foreign exchange transactions was 40.14 per cent, the United States 12.93 per cent, France 7.67 per cent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Taiwan's so-called "diplomatic breakthrough" by sneaking up on yourself.
In response to Taiwan's recent entry to United Nations Headquarters for meetings on religious issues, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China responded at a regular press conference that such a small move was dishonourable and laughterful.
A question was posed by journalists, who, according to the Taiwanese media, had recently entered United Nations Headquarters to participate in a meeting on religious issues in the United States and called it a " diplomatic breakthrough " .
The meeting you mentioned was a United States side event on the premises of the United Nations, not a United Nations meeting at all.
To be honest, the people on the stage are sneaking into the United Nations, self-defeating, and speaking of a so-called "diplomatic breakthrough " , which is a disgraceful little move that makes a big smile.
He noted that the United Nations side had repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to the Taiwan issue in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2758, and that the general membership of the United Nations was committed to the one-China principle.

The authorities have shown a strong crackdown on the President's fall from the Egyptian mountains.
Twitter and social media are strongly advocating that Egyptians take to the streets today and peacefully demand the resignation of President Sessi.
But the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Since the military coup of Cessi, then the head of the military, seized power in 2013, the expression of dissent has virtually disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest has become extremely dangerous.
The British Guardian reported that the Cairo non-governmental organization Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (EGSR) had stated that more than 1900 people had been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests last weekend calling for Seth to step down.
The corruption allegations surrounding Ceci and his family's tyrannical pursuit of vanity have led thousands of people to demonstrate on the streets in 20 years.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior firmly stated yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country would be met with determination and no weakness.
The city centre of Cairo is already heavily guarded, and riot police, security agencies vehicles and plainclothes policemen were seen on the streets around Tahrir Square, where the Egyptian revolution detonated in 2011.
Al Jazeera reports that security forces detained a number of leading scholars and social sages on 25th, including the Professor of Political Science at Cairo University, a leading columnist, Nafa.
He sent a tweet on 24th saying: " I have no doubt that the continuation of the absolute rule of Cessi will cause disaster ... "
"It is in Egypt ' s interest for him to step down immediately. "
Prior to Nafa ' s arrest, Hosni, former Chief of Staff of the Egyptian military, was detained as spokesperson for Anam.
Anna was arrested last year after he tried to win the presidency with Ceci.
The president of the Constitutional Party, Davud, is also being held in custody.
Analysts and politicians argue that, at a time when the economic plight of the poor and the middle class is exacerbated, the campaign against dissent reflects the instability and fragility of government ...
Leader of the opposition, Ayman Nour, who fought for the presidency, said: " The arrest underscores the regime ' s disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fear ... "
"Cessi tried to send a clear message to key leaders and politicians who might replace him, because the economy had been ruined by him, coupled with widespread political oppression ... "
Noor points out that, in the face of the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the Government ' s high-handed approach only increases the anger of the people ...
Now that the barrier of fear has been broken, he expects more people to go to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain and formerly a contractor for construction in the Egyptian military, began to upload a series of films early in the month, claiming to have benefited from the corruption of the government, which triggered a small wave of demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali said that his company, Amlake, could obtain lucrative contracts without having to go through the required bidding process, emphasizing the corruption of the military and its relatives, including the First Lady, Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was very sorry that he had been involved in it.
Ali claims that his help with the Fulfilled Palace and the luxury hotel in Sessigue stands in stark contrast to the abject poverty currently being experienced by Egyptians, and that the other side has not yet paid for it.
On Twitter, such thematic labels as " Stand Up and You Are Not Alone " , "Sessi You Are Dead", "Sexy Rolls", and "Friday Next" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and pushbacks calling for people to go to the streets peacefully to demand Seth to step down.
Amarwick, a Hollywood Egyptian boy, has almost 7 million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted yesterday in Arabic: " Ceci is doomed... he is finished, and those who support him are now making a big mistake... "

According to the Russian satellite network, a study of athletes shows that the brain also shows signs of fatigue after high-intensity motion.
This study, led by Mathias Pesigrion, an expert at the Petier-Salpetrère Hospital in France, shows that there is an invisible link between mental and physical labour: both require cognitive control of activities.
Perciglion explains: " You need to control the autonomous process of forcing yourself to stop when muscle and joint pains ... "
The study was launched by the French National Institute for Physical Education and Physical Education (INSEP).
The school specialist guides athletes to prepare for the Olympics.
Some athletes have begun to develop overtraining syndrome, which is an insufferable sense of fatigue, physical incompetence and a decline in performance after high-load sports.
INSEP asked the question: Is this disease partly due to nervous fatigue, which is caused by over-intelligent work?
The study was published in "Contemporary Biology".

Make it easier for Chinese citizens to "go out" - visit Choi Ai-min, Director of Consular Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Wherever you go, the country is behind you.
On 25th, the first Foreign Ministry consul protection short film was on the line, and the phrase at the end of the short film resonant with the vast majority of the online community.
In an interview with a Xinhua journalist, the Director-General of Consular Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Choi Ai-min, said that the short film was intended to further make people feel the love and the warmth of "diplomatics for the people" and to make Chinese citizens feel that Chinese diplomats would extend their help, help, strength and hope to them, no matter where they were in the world.
There's nothing wrong with being out there. There's always something to do with it.
According to CHOI E-min, the number of Chinese citizens "going out" has increased dramatically over the past 70 years, from "less than a million a year" before reform and opening up to more than a billion times a year today; at the same time, Chinese citizens travel abroad more securely, and consular protection and assistance work has expanded from overseas Chinese to overseas Chinese citizens, tourists, students, workers, etc.
According to statistics, since the Party ' s eighteenth birthday, we have organized more than 10 major evacuations or relocations of Chinese citizens abroad, resulting in the safe evacuation of more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
About half a million requests for assistance were received and coordinated, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, the country can take you home; it's no longer a dream to have a "go and go" trip.
According to Choi E-min, by the end of August this year, China had concluded visa-free mutual agreements with 14 countries covering persons with ordinary passports.
In addition, an increasing number of countries have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens entry facilities such as visa waivers or landing visas ...
Thailand, Egypt and other countries and territories have unilaterally granted visas to Chinese citizens with ordinary passports to land, while 15 countries and territories, including Indonesia, have unilaterally granted exemption to Chinese citizens with regular passports.
In addition to arrangements such as waivers, landings, etc., Chinese citizens are becoming easier to apply for visas and more streamlined procedures.
By the end of August, China had concluded visa facilitation agreements or arrangements with 41 countries.
These include mutual tourism with the United States, Canada, Israel, Argentina, multiple visas issued by business personnel for 10 years, reciprocal travel with the United Kingdom, business, multiple visa arrangements for two years by family visitors, etc.
In the United Kingdom, Belgium jointly introduced a "visa one stop" service, and France, Italy and Singapore reduced visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
The APEC business travel card, which is easily accessible, is a good option for business people who often leave the country.
According to Choi Ei-min, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining visas for more than five years in 16 economies around Asia and the Pacific, and it means a lot to business people, especially private business people, to "go out".
At present, China has the highest number of effective cards in the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote visa facilitation measures by more countries for Chinese citizens, translate the results of diplomatic efforts more into welfare initiatives for all citizens, and continuously increase the " gold content " of Chinese passports.

After two months in Iran's custody, the British tanker Steiner Empire was finally released and departed from Iran's port of Abbas in the morning for international waters.
And just in mid last month, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory released an Iranian tanker that had been detained for more than a month.
According to the news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, at 9 a.m. local time 27 a.m., the British tanker Stanna Empire departed from the port of Abbas for international waters in the Persian Gulf.
The Iranian Port and Shipping Organization of Hormuzgan Province confirmed that the commander and crew of the vessel had made a formal and written commitment and that, despite their arrest, they had no claim.
Steena Bulk, the Swedish owner of the Steiner Empire, also said that the ship was sailing from the port of Abbas.
In addition, the vessel tracking data from Refinitiv found that the tanker had begun to move in 27 years and had left the port of Abbas.
This British-flagged tanker, Stena Impero, was seized by Iran in July this year.
The spokesman for the company said the tanker was preparing to leave Abbas Harbour.
Two weeks after the British seized an Iranian tanker in the waters of Gibraltar, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker, stena Impero, on the Strait of Hormuz.
The ship was released in August.
Earlier this week, the spokesman for the Iranian government said that all the legal procedures required for the release of the Steiner Empire had been completed.
However, according to the Iranian side, the investigation is still ongoing.
Iranian media outlets have also released videos of the tanker's departure.
On 19 July, the IRGC Navy detained a British tanker, the Stanna Empire, in Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz, and then transported it to the port of Abbas.
The Iranian oil tanker Grace One is off the coast of Gibraltar.
In addition, on 4 July, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory seized the "Grace I" tanker carrying Iranian crude oil in the Strait of Gibraltar on the suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.
On August 15, more than a month later, the Gibraltar authorities announced the release of Grace One.
This afternoon, a conference was held in Changsha on the theme of the educational review and rehabilitation of undergraduate colleges throughout the province.
The Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Council, Ulan, stressed the need to improve political positions, strengthen political commitment, take a critical look at the problems, and promote high-quality development in the institutions of higher education, in terms of the effectiveness of thematic education.
Ulan is fully aware of the initial results of the second series of thematic education in undergraduate schools.
She noted that education on the theme "Don't forget your first thoughts, don't forget your mission" was a major deployment of the Party's centre, and that the general secretary of the undergraduate schools had to follow up on Xi's important speech on the theme "Don't forget your first thoughts, don't forget your mission".
From " Four Consciousness " to " Two Ups " , to " Two Ups " , to the political heights of the original mission, to the careful completion of the provisions of the thematic education, especially the set of issues that have been carefully adapted, to the integrated approach to the reform and development of schools, to the " Two Ups and Ones " .
Ulland stressed the need to keep the blade inside, to keep the problem under review, to find out what the four cross-checks are, to ask for advice from teachers and students, parents and all sectors of society, to examine the root causes in a serious and serious way, and to identify and improve the course of the effort, and to come up with a hard way to solve the problem.
Stick to precision, strengthen real change, and keep the word "changed" going.
We need to combine the theme education with the "Ledwoods" and so on, and we need to make sure that the problem remains intact and that it works.
It is important to adhere to both the symptoms and the rules, to improve the long-term mechanisms, to sew the cages of the system, to strengthen the rigidity of the system, to ensure that the work is regulated, regulated, and that the system is truly managed.
In keeping with the above, the leaders will take the lead in strengthening the theoretical force, take the lead in carefully reviewing the changes, take the lead at times, play the role of "key minority" as a model, and try to accomplish the task of thematic education and reform.
Five high school party committees, including Hunan University, were in charge of comrades, and the provincial unit in charge of comrades spoke.
Two major high-pressure projects, one hand-on-one.
On 26th, the direct transmission of electricity from the east to the south of the country at 1100 kV, and the Soto-Tun 1,000 kV exchange at the GIL General Colony project were launched.
Both of these projects, which now occupy high points in each of the world ' s power transmission technologies, will lead to a significant increase in the country ' s energy-extraction optimal configuration.
Guo Ji, Director General of the National Energy Agency, said that the pro-East to Sannan project had the largest power delivery capacity in the world, with the most distant transmissions.
Their delivery is important for promoting the development of Xinjiang energy base and securing electricity supply in the East China region.
GIL, i.e. gas insulation metal closed transmission lines.
The Sutong Concourse project, which created the highest global voltage level for GIL engineering, with the highest transmission capacity, achieved the combined `intercommunication double-ring' of the highest voltage level of the Chinese backbone grid.
According to the National Electricity Network, the distance of power transmission from the Northeast to the South is 3324 km.
With conventional technology, more than 15 per cent of the electricity will be lost in transit, and the project has been developed and developed through closures, raising the economic transport distance to more than 3,000 kilometres.
100 million degrees of power per eight hours and 20 minutes after the drop of the East-South project, which can help to disrupt the loss of the new energy sources available in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, this line will reach between 60 and 85 billion kilowatt-hours per year, which will cover more than half of Shanghai ' s electricity use throughout the year.
The Sutong GIL Integrated Chrysotile Project is the control work of the ultra-high pressure communication ring network across the Yangtze.
Using conventional empty lines to cross the river would require the installation of two giant towers of over 450 metres above the Yangtze River and an artificial island of over four football fields for each tower.
In response, the national electricity grid was boldly innovative and developed a compact super-voltage exchange of GIL transmission technology to cross the river through tunnels, avoiding the impact on the gold channel.
Two projects have contributed to a new leap in our electric engineering capability.
At present, the national grid has built up a 10-to-11 super-high-pressure project and a four-to-three-to-thirty-thirty-thirty-thirty-thirty-thirty-thirty.
Foreign Exchange Office: our external debt structure continues to be optimized and external debt stability enhanced

The data show that, as of the end of June 2019, our external debt balance at full calibre (including this foreign currency) stood at US$ 1998 billion, an increase of US$ 26.3 billion, or 1.3 per cent, compared to the end of March 2019, mainly due to the growth in the debt stock balance.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 per cent of our full-calibre external debt growth was driven by non-residents buying bonds in the domestic renminbi, mainly from medium- and long-term investors such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, the share of medium- and long-term external debt rose by 3 percentage points compared to the end of March 2019, and the share of foreign debt in this currency rose by 1 percentage point compared to the end of March 2019.
Wang Chun Ying stated that with the inclusion of renminbi bonds in our country in April 2019 into the Bloombergaclé global composite index, international investors ' recognition of the Chinese bond market has increased further, with the continued increase of renminbi bonds in China ...
" Our balance of payments is generally balanced and external debt risks are manageable... "
The journalist learned from the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences on 27th that the Yunnan meadows are now effectively protected from widespread outbreaks of disaster and that the prevention effort has produced phased results.
In January of this year, Yunnan Pumang County discovered for the first time that night moths had been moved from foreign lands and subsequently confirmed in 129 counties in Yunnan, and that night moths had spread from Yunnan to mainland China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.
Grassland night moths are an important agricultural pest from the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas of multi-edible long-range migration. They are a major migratory pest of the FAO Global Warning, characterized by "internationality, migration, outbreak, destruction".
The pest endangers more than 80 crops, such as maize, sugar cane, sorghum, and takes large amounts of food, causing up to 70 per cent loss of production.
It's very difficult to control it, and there are no registered pesticides in China to control it.
The Yunnan Department of Agricultural Sciences has selected Ai-Tung Fellows to lead the Yunnan Department of Agricultural Sciences on cross-border harmful organisms in agriculture, in coordination with the Green Prevention and Control Department innovation team, to travel to the first line, field research, take samples and conduct demonstration of technical guidance and experiments.
The Xiao Yidong team has acquired initial stock characteristics of the Yunnan meadows, natural trichlorfon resources, off-shore source characteristics, stock migration trajectory, poisons and field control effects.
They are actively engaged in research and application of green control technologies, and through the implementation of new green control technologies, such as stock monitoring, insecticide trapping, scientific medicine and agronomy measures, have achieved more than 90 per cent control in demonstration areas, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural enemy resources and the ecological environment, and providing technical safeguards for the effective control of the outbreak of night moths and sustainable governance in Yunnan.
At present, the Yunnan meadows have been effectively protected from large-scale outbreaks and have achieved phased results.
Next, the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on the ecological mechanisms of the invasion of populations, breaking through the biocontrol and green control systems.
At the same time, to actively promote cross-border international cooperation with a view to establishing joint priority laboratories and joint monitoring networks and demonstration areas outside the country to enhance the full range of monitoring and early warning capabilities for night moths in Yunnan.

White paper: China moving out of a country-specific development path
On September 27, China News Agency Beijing released a White Paper on "China and the World in a New Age" by the State Council Press Office of China.
The White Paper states that over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have struggled to explore and move forward, successfully opening up the path of socialism in China ' s unique identity and achieving world-renowned development achievements.
According to the White Paper, China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development is based on the solid spirit of "800 million shirts for a Boeing" , which has lasted for generations, and has continued to struggle for unimaginable hard work and sweat. It is based on the spirit of "one's own responsibility" — whether in good faith or in adversity — not to export problems, not to turn to contradictions, not to exploit others by buying or selling them, not to take advantage of one's own development. It is based on the spirit of "touching through the river", not on imperialism, colonialism, not on the development model of the West, but on a combination of Chinese reality, to learn lessons and learn from human civilization, to try and get out of one's own way.
The White Paper states that China is developing in its interaction with the world, that China ' s development has injected positive energy into world peace and development, and that China ' s roads are adapted to China ' s circumstances and to the requirements of the times.
China is taking action to preserve world peace.
For 70 years, China has not initiated any war or conflict and has not appropriated an inch of another country ' s land.
The White Paper states that China ' s development has been a great success over the past 70 years, and that the underlying reason is to find the right path of development of China ' s special socialism and to follow it with determination.
It is a path based on national circumstances, which prioritizes the interests of the people, innovates reforms, seeks common development in openness, and fully adheres to the rule of law.
China is so big and complex that governance is so difficult that it is not centralized and has strong leadership, that it will lead to division and disintegration and bring disaster to the world.
According to the White Paper, over 70 years, China has overcome risks and challenges and created another world-renowned Chinese miracle.
In particular, since the 18th year of the Communist Party of China, China has achieved historic achievements in its development, with historic changes that have brought the Chinese nation closer to the great goal of national renaissance than ever before.
This path of development in China will increasingly show a bright future as the times move forward.

Taiwan scholars have argued that the "Occupiated Ages" has to keep up with the mainstream industries on the mainland.
"2019 Business Innovative Business Models Forum", 26-27 days a day or two in Taipei.
The event invited a number of representatives of broadcasters and scholars to share their experiences on business transformation, innovation, succession and market openings.
The Forum was hosted by the Taipei Institute of Management and was co-sponsored by organizations such as the Goldstone Securities and the Alliance of Excellence in Continental Trade.
The two-day meeting was divided into transformational upgrading models, business strategies, etc., and was held in a series of workshops with over 100 participants.
Chen Myung-hoon, President of the Taipei Institute of Management, said that China and the United States trade friction continued and Taiwan faced an age of uncertainty.
In his view, it was necessary to keep pace with the times and keep pace with the mainstream industries that had developed on the continent, with particular attention to innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
"The past is about quality, effectiveness and delivery... "
According to Chen Mingxian, these conditions are no longer sufficient.
He pointed out that firms needed both speed and service to speed up the supply chain and to focus on extension and product services.
In addition, "service value added" is a new area in which operators can develop significantly.
A statement was made by the representative of the Taiwan Dealer, who introduced the Chairman of the Taiwan Dealer Ame Electronics Ltd. from Guangdong, Huu Wen-Cong, who said that Ame Electronics had experienced operational difficulties as a result of a sharp decline in orders, and that the group had moved from a variety of orientations, such as structural adjustments and living assets, to improve its performance.

New regulations for consultation: qualification for access to rural land by social capital
Qualified access to rural land by social capital
Public consultation on rural land transfer management options to regulate the transfer of social capital to land, such as business enterprises
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development published an open notice for comments on the " Management of Rural Land Administration Transfers (Revised Draft) " (hereinafter referred to as the " Draft Opinion " ), which increased the regulation and risk protection of social capital transfer rights to land, such as business enterprises.
The Draft Opinion is now open to public consultation.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, in order to implement the newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act, to further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, to deepen the reform of the rural land system and to implement the three-power system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has revised the scheme for the management of rural land contract transfer.
The Beijing Young News reporter learned that the first published "opinion" was subject to a number of important changes.
The newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act clarifies the scope of land flow and implements the concept of the "triple separation of powers", with a specific section on "the right to contract land" and "the right to operate land " , making a clear distinction between the transfer of land contract rights, swaps and the transfer of land rights (rents, turnkeys, shares or otherwise).
In implementing the concept of the "triple distribution of powers" and responding effectively to the thrust of the "Rural Land Contracting Act" amendment, and taking into account the considerable differences between the transfer of land and the exchange of land contracting rights, transfer in the parties, procedure, regulation, etc., the present revision defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on the transfer of land, including by leasing, equity, etc., and changes the regulatory title to the "Rural Land Contracting Transfer Management Scheme" to "Rural Land Administration Transfer Management Scheme " .
The swap will provide for separate management arrangements for the transfer of land contracting rights.
According to the Draft Opinion, in the context of the Three Power Divisions, farmers are only holding land rights for a limited period of time.
Theoretically, even in the event of liquidation, farmers only run the risk of losing the right to operate for a certain period of time, and thus providing for the return of the contracting land to the original contractor is no longer legally necessary and in conflict with "insolvency law".
In response to the issue of preventing the risk of land loss by farmers, priority shares, first lease and then buy back have been created in practice.
Taking into account that priority shares have matured theoretical exploration of company law, it is recommended that they be used as an advocacy provision to protect against the risk of loss of access ...
