According to the British media, the United States Vice-Minister of Naval Operations, General William Moran, said that, even as the United States Navy was re-energizing to deal with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the United States continued to focus on the Asia-Pacific region — the Pentagon extending the area to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific.
According to the United Kingdom ' s Jane's Defense Weekly website, September 24, the United States listed Russia and China as strategic competitors in its new defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the United States Navy has resumed its second fleet in order to confront Russia more directly.
Reports suggest that these moves raise some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who fear that the United States Navy might be far away from the "Asia Pacific Rebalancing" strategy of the Obama administration.
But Admiral Moran said that the focus of the United States Navy was still on the Western Pacific.
On 24 January 2018, at a round-table discussion entitled "Responding to the Challenges of the High Seas", hosted by the National Asian Research Office in Washington, D.C., he said, "There has been no major change for us... "
Milan said: " The point remains rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it ... "
But he admitted that the United States was close to Europe.
He said, " We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do... "
Although Moran pointed out that the overall policy regarding Russia was within the purview of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned: " Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we clash with them, they will be very hard ... "
Admiral Moran said that, as part of the renewed United States campaign against Russia, China and other competitors, the United States Navy was dynamically deploying its forces into a " new mode of operation " , which would help to surprise opponents as to where American carriers or other assets would be deployed at any given time or place.
He said, " We, the Navy and the Marines, support it -- - the concept of unpredictability of operations, not to appear in the same place again and again, almost like a hairline -- -- this is how we do it... "
It was reported that the first attempt at this new approach was the Harry Truman carrier combat group, whose early deployment included working visits to ports and patrolling areas that were usually only passing through.
Moran said that the United States Navy was currently working to ensure that allies knew that the ships would continue to patrol the traditional areas and were also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment procedures.
The Royal Australian Navy Commander, Lieutenant General Michael Nunan, also addressed the event, saying that the Australian army could work seamlessly with American carriers.
He said that the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more frigates with Zeus Shield.
Since October 5, a number of airlines have increased or restored fuel surcharges.
Yesterday, the airline Xiang Peng Air, Okai Air and others announced that, starting on October 5, 2018 (the date of the ticket), each passenger on the domestic route would be charged a 20-mile fuel surcharge and each passenger on the more than 800-km surcharge.
Xiang Poon Air, Okey Air and others have announced that the rate of surcharges for fuel on domestic routes below 800 km has risen from 10 to 20 yuan per person per person, and the rate of surcharges on fuel on domestic routes over 800 km from 10 to 30 yuan per passenger per person, starting at 0 o'clock on 5 October 2018 (the date of issuance of tickets).
Children, 10 yuan/persons disabled by the military and police; babies continue to be exempted.
According to the person in charge of the airline ticket, the airline had indicated in its notification that the fuel surcharge was charged on the date of the original ticket, and that the fuel surcharge was not refunded in exchange for the ticket.
This means that domestic airline tickets issued prior to 5 October will not be subject to the new fuel surcharge if they are to be changed after 5 October.
Since 5 June 2018, several airlines, such as the State, the East, the Sea, Shanghai, Spring and Fall, Shenzhen, Western, Okai and others, have resumed charging fuel surcharges for three years of cancelled domestic routes at a standard rate of $10 per person.
On this occasion, O'Hare Air announced an increase in the fuel surcharge, and as soon as the press release was sent, no information was received from the four major airlines in the country to follow up on the adjustment.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department provides that airlines will be free from November to decide whether to charge a surcharge for fuel ...
On September 27th, the earliest announcement was that the fuel surcharge would be recharged on November 2nd.
According to the Thai-Thai air website, all air tickets issued or reissued on or after November 2nd will include fuel surcharges, long-distance flights to Hong Kong and the South-West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, African flights, fuel surcharges of $652 and short-distance flights of $146.
The cost applies to all categories of tickets, is calculated for each segment and includes quotations for air tickets from all direct distribution channels in Thailand.

According to Maru Hong, the United States grain sector, under the banner of the trade war, has suspended its financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese manufacturers of heavy equipment, telecommunications companies, etc., have warned of the effects of trade friction between China and the United States when they announced their latest performance, and these Japanese traders have joined the ranks.
The United States and China are charging hundreds of billions of dollars to each other, and US President Trump is threatening to extend the tax to all more than $500 billion in Chinese-American goods if the dispute is not resolved.
The Ito Trushi Hachimura, Director of Commercial Finance, said that the impact of the trade dispute on the Chinese economy might be even greater next year.
Ito Trung and the Thai Bing Group invested $10 billion in Nakashin in 2015 to gain 20 per cent of their equity.
Hachimura claims that Ito Trunchin raised a loss of 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) for this portion of the stock holdings, as it is believed that the Chinese share price will not rise again in the near future.
Ito Chuan Commercial maintained a projection of profits for the fiscal year 31st March 2019 at 500 billion yen.

On November 5th, China-News Online reported that the mid-term election poll in the United States is in its countdown.
On 4 November, President Trump and his Democratic rivals actively "urged" to their core constituents.
Both parties point out that voter turnout will be the key to the voting process.
It is reported that in 48 hours before the vote in the United States, Trump was busy with the Republican campaigning, while former President Obama went to Indiana to stand for the impending Democratic Federal Senate candidate, Joe Donnelly, and to shout out the final demands before the election.
On 4 November, Trump went to Megang, Georgia, to stand for Republican governor candidate Brian Kemp, and said, " Tuesday you must be at the polling station, you must vote... "
"The comparison between this election cannot be made clearer... "
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has gone far beyond normal.
The President of the United States faced the first mid-term elections, and the number of seats in the Congress of his party tended to decrease.
According to a new poll published by the Washington Post and the American Broadcasting Corporation News Network (ABC News) on 4th, while the Democratic Party's federal House of Representatives continues to have an advantage, Republicans can benefit from economic assessment and from Trump's strict interest in border security.
According to the polls, registered voters prefer the Democratic House of Representatives to Republicans, 50% to 43%, but there is still a decline from the 14 percentage points ahead in August.
Another poll by the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also shows that the Democrats are still ahead of the Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is known that Obama, on the occasion of Senator Donnelly ' s campaign, said to the public: " When people don ' t tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there will be consequences ...
Democracy cannot work when people can only lie to themselves. "
"The only way to stop these Republicans now is you and your vote... "
The Democrats face the most difficult elections in the Senate for decades, and the Republicans now hold more than half of the 51 seats.
But the House of Representatives is better, and the Democrats need to win 23 more seats to take control of the House of Representatives, which has 435 seats.
According to the analysts of the projected election site FiveThirtyEight.com, the chances of Democrats winning the House of Representatives are as high as 85%.
The National Political Consultative Conference convened an important theoretical seminar for the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the Civil Affairs Association, attended by and addressed by Wang Yang.
Xi Jinping General Secretary ' s seminar on key ideological theories for strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC was held in Kyoto from 29 to 30 June.
The Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Republic, Chairman of the National Political Consultative Conference, Wang Yang, attended and addressed the meeting.
He stressed that the important ideas of Secretary-General Xi Jinping for strengthening and improving the work of the ACHD were a profound articulation of the role of ACHD, its objectives, its mission, its practical requirements, its scientific answers to a number of directions, its overall nature, its strategic and major issues, and its powerful intellectual tool to guide the work of the ACHD for the New Era.
It is important to learn to implement this important idea, to learn its significance, to enrich its content and spiritual essence, to learn to do what is practical, to learn theory, to promote the quality of the work of the Political Consultative Assembly, and to take up the new mission of the New Era Civil Affairs Association.
From 29 to 30 September, the National Political Consultative Conference held a seminar in Beijing on key ideological theories for the General Secretary of Xi Jinping to strengthen and improve the work of the Association.
Wang Yang noted that, since the Party ' s eighteenth birthday, General Secretary Xi Jinping has proposed a new set of ideas and ideas for strengthening and improving the work of the ACHD. For the first time, ACHD has been proposed as an important channel and specialized consultative body for the negotiation of socialist democracy, an important part of the system of State governance, an institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics. For the first time, it has clarified the characteristics and advantages of the new political party system, with a strong emphasis on the proper handling of the relationship between coherence and diversity. It has revealed that the true meaning of popular democracy is that there are things to be negotiated, that people ' s things have been discussed, and that there is a logical link between the "rule of China" and the Chinese political system, that there is a strong attachment to good, and that the development of the civil affairs system of good people is the most recent product of the Party ' s civil affairs association.
Wang stressed that the PACs at all levels should use theoretical studies as an opportunity to further identify weaknesses and shortcomings in their work and to strengthen and improve their efforts to achieve breakthroughs.
A comprehensive strengthening of the political consultative system party is needed to ensure that the party ' s central decision-making is deployed and implemented in the political consultative process.
To strengthen intellectual and political leadership, improve the system of political discourse and consensus-building on "two-way dynamics", procedures and mechanisms to translate intellectual and political leadership into all aspects and processes of performance.
Focus on the Centre ' s mission to perform its duties, to be more subordinate to the Service Party and the State, to improve the quality and effectiveness of its mandate.
To strengthen the CPPCC ' s capacity-building and training of commissioners and cadres, to play a fundamental role in the Commission and to strengthen the basis on which the CPPCC functions.
Increased guidance, orientation, demonstration, resolution of challenges and raising the overall profile of the work of the local political consultative bodies.
In order to learn more about the implementation of Xi Jinping’s socialist ideas and the spirit of the Party’s 19th speciality in the new era of China, the National System of Political Consultative Associations began in May with an important intellectual study and discussion campaign by the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping to strengthen and improve the work of the Association, convening eight regional symposia and seven expert scholars’ seminars, identifying 18 priority topics and six basic theoretical topics, comprising 79.38 million members of the Committees at all levels, and 279,000 officials of the organs participating in studies and seminars, resulting in more than 36,000 research papers.
In the current wave of popular entrepreneurship, innovation for all, the People's Network Beijing, on November 5, has seen a growing number of technology companies focusing on patent R & D and its associated protections, digging deep into the potential value of patents and gaining market dominance.
Similarly, there are a number of technology firms that have experienced significant abuses in patent technology licensing, the use of patented technology, etc.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, Ho Changhong, from Guangdong Province, and Rabin, the developer of the APP, Beijing Little Orange Technology Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Orange Technology), operator drop-drop technology Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as drop-off), and seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) v. Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court, on the grounds of patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately cease manufacturing, selling, promising to sell and using the plaintiff ' s patent.
On 30 October 2018, the Chinese Network of Judges published the " Civil decision of first instance in disputes over patent infringement of inventions, such as Tan Wei, Ho Hung and Beijing Orange Technology Co. Ltd. " , revealing the details of some of the cases of patent infringement in which APPs were prosecuted.
The three plaintiffs argued that patented patent owners and inventors of "moveable terminal-based carpooling systems and methods" and that the entire operation of the APP application corresponded to the technical scheme of patent protection in question, constituting a patent infringement.
However, at the time of the Court's decision, OrangeTech concluded that the Guangdong Pacific was not a proper defendant, that it had merely provided a free download on the Internet of the APP drop-off, that it had not applied the patent method in question, that there was no direct or indirect violation, and that it should not be listed as the defendant in the case.
Secondly, the violation in this case is not in Guangdong.
In accordance with the law, the tort of the patent in question was the place where the patent method in question was applied in its entirety, and the jurisdiction of the court was challenged, requesting that the case be referred to the court of the defendant ' s domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court ...
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific had supplied on its Internet platform an APP product charged with tort, and that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant Guangdong Pacific as the defendant.
And the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, resides in Guangzhou City and is under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Orange Technology, filed a motion for referral of the case to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, which was insufficiently substantiated, dismissed the defendant, Orange Technology Ltd. ' s challenge of jurisdiction in the case and assumed the costs of admissibility of the jurisdictional challenge.
Other proceedings in the case have not yet been made public, and journalists will follow up on the patent infringement.
Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research: significant results of scientific cooperation in Australasia
" China ' s science and technology has developed rapidly over the past decades, and the two countries of Australia and China can achieve fruitful results together in the field of science ... "
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research, in a recent interview with a Chinese News Agency journalist in Beijing, said that cooperation in the field of science and technology in Australia, from climate change to Sky-Eye, was a promising experience.
As the largest national scientific research agency in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research findings of world interest in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, astronomy, etc.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"It's a long-lasting friendship, a friendship that includes trust in partners and a long tradition of cooperation... " Marshall said ...
In May of this year, China's 500-metre spherical radio telescope, China SkyEye, installed the first international 19-beam L-band receiver.
The 19-beam feed receiver, currently the most advanced in the world, was developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall indicated that the successful development of the receivers was based on the accumulation of CSIRO technology over the years, and that the speed of the FEST cruises would increase by five to six times as soon as it was activated, while at the same time expanding the scientific observation targets.
"This is a contribution of CSIRO to FAST..."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO is working closely with Chinese scientific institutions on the construction of a square kilometre array radio telescope, the development of new fuel technologies and the reduction of energy savings.
"In the past, scientific research has tended to focus on hundreds of years later, and now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems that lie ahead... "
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a range of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather events are frequent around the world, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, demographic explosion, ageing, chronic diseases and so on are the serious challenges that are currently facing us.
" The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused primarily on solving these immediate difficulties ... "
Marshall explained that the International Centre for the Study of the Southern Hemisphere, established by CSIRO in cooperation with the Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, focused on observing the El Niño phenomenon and the La Niña phenomenon, studying their relationship to extreme weather and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather; the new varieties of cereals to overcome extreme weather, developed by CSIRO in cooperation with the Chinese Academy, could also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
" In the current environment, where science, technology and innovation are difficult to accomplish alone, very costly, and there are so many issues to be addressed, cooperation is particularly important today ... "
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the greater the likelihood of breakthrough progress, that is what it means for the two sides to work together within the "one way" framework.
" Strengthening bilateral cooperation, mainly in science and technology, for us ... "
For example, Marshall, CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, which is very dangerous to the environment because of the traditional gold purification method of cyanide, and many countries hope to find a method of pure gold that is less polluting to the environment.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our participation in the "one way" cooperation. "
On 29th, the 2018 Chicken Silk Road Tourist Promotion and Project Collaboration Forum was held in the city of Urumqi, Xinjiang, where guests, while appreciating the development of the Bo chicken, could also enjoy local food and feel the weight of local historical culture.
During the first month of the event, a series of tourism promotion campaigns were conducted in eight cities along the Silk Road, namely, Tian Shui, Cool, Lanzhou, Silvergawa, Sienin, Zhang Jian and Hami, which provided a good basis for the successful launch of the 2018 Chicken Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Partnership Fair.

At the same time, the Xinjiang Travel Agency signed a cooperation agreement on tourism with the Bo-Wing River tourist area, the Famen Temple Buddhist cultural site, the Tai White Mountain tourist area, and the Guanshan Savannah site.
" The Great United States of America, where some tourism resources are complementary to the BPW, we travel all the way to Xinjiang, and we present the human chicken, the delicious chicken, the natural wind, and more than 500 photographs to make customers feel the beauty of the BP chicken... "
The event focused on tourism resources, tourism projects, tourism routes, etc., through the broadcasting of tourism promotional films, the promotion of cultural tourism resources and projects, the holding of tourism photography exhibitions, the production of promotional brochures, the distribution of promotional materials, the exchange of tourism cooperation, and the promotion of a comprehensive picture of the tourism industry as a whole, high-quality tourism products and excellent tourism industry projects, the consolidation of the Xinjiang passenger market, the full roll-out of the brand "Look at China's Chicken", the promotion of the influence and visibility of the city in the northwest, and the attraction of more Xinjiang tourists for the Xinjiang chicken tour experience.
The Deputy Director of the Pony City Recruitment Bureau, Feng Xu, said: " This event, the Pony City departments at all levels, the districts, the development districts, actively engaged in contacts, coordinated the implementation of a large number of good projects, big projects.
To date, 41 contracted projects have been implemented, involving a total of 26.43 billion yuan ... "
In recent years, it has been built around the goal of building internationally integrated cities along the "One Way" initiative, equipping manufacturing cities, historical and cultural names and beautiful and happy cities with decent living conditions, continuously upgrading industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, opening up highlands, human cohesion, and accelerating catch-up and high-quality development.
In 2017, total regional production amounted to RMB 218 billion, an increase of 8.7 per cent.
More than 20 national honours were awarded to civilized cities across the country, the National Ecoforestry City and the China Human Settlements Environment Award.
The Urumqi City Council Standing Committee, Deputy Mayor Yin Namin, introduced Urumqi as a major town on the Silk Road in New North Province, with a special geographical advantage, since ancient times, connecting Tianshan North and South, communicating between Xinjiang and the interior, connecting China and Central Asia, West Asia and Europe, and an important window for opening up China to the west and exchanging economic and cultural exchanges with the outside world, with a good investment climate.

The Foreign Minister of Korea, Lee Yong Ho, stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions is deepening North Korea ' s mistrust of the United States and that North Korea cannot unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under such circumstances ...
According to Lee Yong Ho at the United Nations General Assembly, the DPRK has taken a " very friendly approach " over the past year, including the cessation of missile and nuclear tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and a commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
" But we did not see any corresponding response from the United States " , he said.
"We have no confidence in our national security if we don't trust the United States, and in such circumstances we cannot give up weapons unilaterally ... "
Although Lee Yong-ho echoed North Korea's complaints about the United States' opposition to "phased" denuclearization, his speech was of great significance, as there was no total rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea had done in the past.
Lee Yong-ho referred to Kim Jong-un and Trump's joint statement of 12 June, when Kim Jong-un agreed to work towards "denuclearizing the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has claimed that North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first...
The U.S. also refuses to relax its demand for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on `denuclearizing first ' and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its objectives in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to issue the `Declaration on the End of War ' , "Li Yong-ho-ho, "
"The idea that sanctions can make us beg for forgiveness on our knees is that those who don't know us are dreaming.
But the problem is that this continued sanctions deepen our mistrust ... "
Lee Yong-ho didn't mention the second Special Union project that the President of the United States mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
On the contrary, he highlighted the three meetings between Kim Jong-un and the President of the Republic of Korea during the past five months and said: " If the other side of denuclearization is Korea, not North Korea, then denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so frozen ... "
China announced a reduction in import duties for 1,585 tax purposes as of 1 November 2018.
Since this year, China has taken successive initiatives to reduce import tariffs.
On 1 May of this year, there was a general tax reduction on medicines, with an adjustment of customs duties to zero for a total of 28 tax-related purposes, including all generic and carcinogen-resistant bioalkali drugs, and actual imports of Chinese-made drugs.
At the same time, there has been a significant reduction in the production of anti-cancer medicines, import chain value added tax (VAT) duties.
Tax deductions for 218 taxed cars and spare parts on 1 July.
After the tax reduction, China ' s whole car tax rate is below the average in developing countries and is consistent with China ' s real automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive industrial restructuring and optimal resource allocation, accelerate success and underachievement, improve the quality of products and services, and are expected to boost automobile price adjustment to some extent and increase consumer benefits.
On 1 July, a daily tax deduction for 1,449 tax purposes was made for consumer goods.
Tax deductions on consumer goods are linked to the need for a better life for people.
The tax cuts were not only large but also strong, with an average of 56 per cent.
Taxes on consumer goods are applied directly to consumers and promote competitiveness in domestic industries.
On 1 November, a tax reduction will be imposed on industrial items such as mechanical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials for 1585 tax purposes.
Appropriately reducing tariffs on imports of much-needed industrial goods in some parts of the country can attract more foreign investment, contribute to more efficient domestic supply, boost industrial upgrading, and help enterprises to allocate resources globally, reduce production costs, and reduce domestic environmental burden.
The relevant head of the Office of the Customs and Excise Commission of the State Council of China explained that the four above-mentioned autonomous tax reductions, together with the third step, implemented on 1 July this year as a result of negotiations on the extension of the scope of the information technology agreement, would reduce China ' s total tariff level from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent.
The overall adjusted tariff levels are slightly higher than those of the EU, are lower than those of most developing countries, are at moderate low levels and are largely compatible with China ' s developing country status and stage of development.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that, as one of the key indicators of China ' s openness in the area of trade in goods, the overall level of tariffs should be adapted to the stage of China ' s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China ' s trade in goods is the world ' s number one, and it already has an open economic base for further expansion, but the quality and efficiency of trade development are not as good as that of developed economies, and therefore the overall level of tariffs should be reduced as appropriate.
Tariffs are a means of protection for compliance, and they should be commensurate with industrial competitiveness, encourage benign competition, and overprotect against industrial development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjustments need to be balanced between production needs and consumption needs.
Focusing on reducing high levels of domestic demand, contributing to the upgrading of commodity tariffs for industrial transformation, efforts to increase the import of niche niche products where the population ' s needs are more concentrated, increasing business and public access and meeting the upgrading needs of industrial and consumption structures.
Tax cuts need to balance fiscal revenues with the affordability of industrial development.
The choice of a specific tax-reducing commodity and a tax-reducing range should be made to harmonize the two markets, both domestic and foreign, both upstream and downstream, production and consumption, and to maintain the momentum of China ' s steady and moderate economic growth.
The Officer-in-Charge stressed that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the reform and opening of the country, and that China has taken the initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs in accordance with the major steps that China needs to achieve its own high-quality development. This is conducive to the integrated use of both international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system and meeting the needs of the population in terms of rising consumption.
These actions and initiatives demonstrate that China will resolutely pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, firmly support economic globalization, firmly uphold the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system, with the WTO at its core, and continue to draw momentum from opening up to the world and make China's development work better for the world.
The President of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
According to the Serbian Presidential Office, the President of Serbia, Vucic of Serbia, ordered the country ' s armed forces to be at maximum operational readiness, given that the Kosovo Special Forces occupied the access to the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station in northern Kosovo, which is controlled by Belgrade.
29 September, the Minister of Defence of Serbia, Wulin, declared that the Serbian army was on full operational alert.
The Wulins stress that Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the orders issued by Vucic remain in force, and that the RSLF will respond regardless of the course of events.
On 29 September, Vucic, in an interview with the Russian agency Tass, stated that he had briefed the United States and the Europeans, among others, on the current situation and would travel to Moscow on 2 October to meet with Russian President Putin to seek Putin’s support on Kosovo.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vucic replied in the negative: " I do not want a major military conflict on our territory ... "
Vucić also stated that the full operational readiness of the RSLA was only intended to serve as a deterrent to prevent a conflict, but it was also a clear warning that no acts of violence would be tolerated in Kosovo ...
The increased operational readiness of the RSLA is linked to two major Kosovo initiatives.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, the ethnic Albanians in the northern part of Kosovo are engaged in mass arrests of Serbs who have been living there for generations and who are not in violation of any law ...
Vucić claims that, since the beating and detention of Marko Juridge, head of the Serbian Government office in Kosovo and Metohija, on 26 March of this year, the Albanian community has escalated the situation in the region, carrying out inhuman arrests and deportations of Serbs ...
In addition, the previously self-proclaimed special forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, the ROSSU Special Forces, more than 100 persons, including armed police and snipers, occupied positions near the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric station, entered the ecological and sports centre near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo and blocked all nearby roads, which were otherwise controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic points out that this military adventure in Kosovo was instigated by Western countries, and that the Kosovo Army's actions did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, as well as Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the military-technical agreement between Séko.
Vucic has already spoken to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocrisy of Western countries on Kosovo.
The root cause of the current conflict remains the centuries-old historical feud between the two communities in Kosovo.
There is a difference between Serbs and Albanians in terms of Kosovo ' s belongings.
Serbia regards Kosovo as a national birthplace and a cradle of culture, as Serbia built its most powerful State here in the 12th century, and Albanians moved in in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invasion and the defeat of the Serbian army in the north.
The Albanians, for their part, maintained that the original tribe of Ilya, who lived in Kosovo in the fourth and fifth centuries B.C., was an ancestor of the ethnic Albanians and that Kosovo had been an ethnic Albanian territory since time immemorial.
Subjective political divisions have led to violent clashes between different ethnic groups and religions and cultures, which have led to violent confrontations between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, with a relative increase in the proportion of Serbs who, in the view of the Serbs, "only take back their own land" but were considered by the Albanians to be the plundering of the Greater Serbism, which fuelled the bi-communal conflict.
Kosovo became a " powder keg " in the Balkans.
In 1999, an armed conflict between the Albanian separatists of the KLA and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO forces and the outbreak of the war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its secession from Serbia ...
Since then, despite reports that Serbia will normalize its relations with Kosovo and sign global and legally binding agreements, agreements that have been held hostage to various forces, such as the United States and the Russian Federation, have not been concluded due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
And just a month ago, Vucic made it clear, for the first time, that he advocated the separation of Serbs from Albanians in Kosovo and that he would once again open up a conflict between the two communities ...
Electricity is still out of order.
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of 30, a strong earthquake and tsunami in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi Province of the country, killed 420 people on 28th.
According to Wilem Rampangilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, this figure is only a preliminary estimate of the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi, about 80 km from the epicentre of the earthquake, owing to the lack of a large search and rescue machine and the fact that many hotels, shops, warehouses, etc., have been destroyed as a result of the collapse of the earthquake.
On 29 September 2018, local time, a bridge damaged by an earthquake and tsunami collapsed in Balo, Indonesia.
As a result of the severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the Dungara district and the adjacent Sigi region remain unconnected " islands " , unable to count the number of victims.
In this press report, Indonesian Vice President Kara said that thousands of people were killed.
Power cuts, communications disruptions, road blockages, airport damage... and the post-tsunami relief efforts are difficult.
As a result of power cuts, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu are dependent on fuel for electricity generation.
Roads into and out of the city were blocked by landslides and the lack of access of large transport vehicles, including fuel tankers, straining the supply of fuel.
According to the Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus, emergency relief supplies, such as shelter kits, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food, household kits, etc., have not yet arrived in the affected areas due to road damage.
The relief materials transferred from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the affected areas by air transport.
In view of the damage caused to the Palu airport command towers and runways during the earthquake, and in order to ensure safety and security of the rescue, all commercial flights have been suspended for the purpose of landing and landing only military aircraft transporting relief supplies and personnel.
In Indonesian politics, where rescue is directed in the earthquake zone, the Minister for Legal and Security Affairs, Virando, has requested that electricity supply and airport commercial flight services be restored as soon as possible in order to ensure the functioning of relief agencies such as hospitals, more rescue workers and volunteers and the delivery of aid to the affected areas.
28 A series of strong earthquakes in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, triggered by a tsunami at 1702 hours from a 7.07-scale earthquake that caused major disasters in the city of Palu, Dungara and Sigi districts.
On October 1st, the Chinese news agency Beijing called "The White Clouds", "The Drunk" and "The Beautiful Skyline, which is the best card in Beijing."
Since August, Beijing has been the blueest sky.
Inside the city, people can be seen anywhere, either with a smart phone or with a single anti-camera.
On social platforms such as Twitter, the Weibo Circle of Friends, the palace, the Tiananmen Gate, the nests, the alleys, all over the Internet, all of the buildings displaying different beautys under the blue sky.
Some netizens say that this is the best city film in Beijing; others argue that if this blue sky were brushed for a long time, people with cervical vertebrae could be cured; and even more so, they hope that "the blue will spring through the winter and make the sky of the city blue over the seasons."
Why does the people of the capital love the sky?
Only because people who lived in this city in the past suffered from the fog, and so much so longing for the blue sky, and after Beijing ' s " blue sky defense battles " , which continued to improve air quality, the fog became less, the blue sky grew, and the people were happy in their eyes, and the happiness they had gained was all the more.
On the Fourth of July, the weather was clear in Beijing.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the city's 35 air quality monitoring stations were shown to be "first-class" green.
The "Blueest Sky" photo contest on social platforms, spontaneous by the people, is still going on.
Why is it so blue in Beijing lately?
According to the head of the Beijing City Environmental Protection Agency, the average concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 ug/m3 in August of this year, the best ever recorded for the last five years.
The PM2.5 in September is more frequent in real-time digits.
A major factor in the emergence of the "Blueest Sky" is the overall favourable weather conditions in recent times and, more importantly, the sustained efforts made in Beijing to combat atmospheric pollution, the vigorous promotion of clean air action plans over the past five years and the continued release of environmental benefits, which have led to a reduction in the total discharge of pollutants in the region, all of which have laid the foundation for a sustained improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing City Action Plan on Clean Air 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, official efforts are continuously directed at defunctionalizing non-capital functions and promoting energy clean-up and pollution reduction, with a total of 4923 coal-fired boilers being phased out.
Beijing became the first big city in China to become a net gas-free city.
The data show that between 2013 and 2017 the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased cumulatively by 35.6 per cent; the number of air quality days increased by 50 days; the number of first-class good days increased by 25 days; the number of days of heavy contamination decreased by 35 days and the incidence of heavy contamination decreased significantly.
In parallel with the continuing improvement in air quality, the Beijing official, based on a new round of PM2.5 sources, launched in September this year the Beijing Three-Year Plan of Action to Win the Blue Sky Defense, which focuses on the current phase of governance and pollution features, such priority areas as diesel trucks, dusting, volatile organic matter management, optimizing transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures and land use structures, strengthening regional alliances, investing in the fine management of cities, promoting green development across the board, and trying to bring the blueest sky back to Kyoto and making it less expensive than it is, and bringing it back to the background and not to the forefront.
During the Golden Week of the National Day, the relevant departments, such as the Municipal Tourism Board, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the City Agency, the Public Security Department and others, will intensify their law enforcement checks on the "one day" market, focus on the "six black" phenomenon of tourism, and, once found guilty, the offenders will be subject to heavy and heavy penalties in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the city government held a special session on the illegal one-day tour and deployed a special operation to fight further on the illegal one-day trip.
At the conference, it was revealed that the focus black votes, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks
Since the launch of the special initiative, 39 "one day trip" complaints have been processed across the city, a decrease of 63 per cent over the same period; since this year, 270 "one day trip" complaints have been processed across the city, a decrease of 62 per cent over the same period.
Over the past two months, the city has seized 248 Black Cars, seized 158 offences in tourist passenger operations, closed 29 shopping "Black Shops" and performing venues, opened 13 "Black Houses", 27 Black Guides", confiscated 26,000 illegal ads, removed 31 illegal "one-day" billboards, 3 bus stop signs, investigated 1789 offences involving various travels, opened 181 cases with heavy fines of $4.48 million and detained 111 persons involved in travel offences.
After a clean-up, the illegal "one day" mess was largely contained, and the "one day" market order was stable and good.
In recent years, the city has been increasing its efforts to deal with illegal one-day trips.
In 2016 and 2017, the MTC received 162 and 897 complaints of "one day" — 79 per cent and 44 per cent less, respectively — but the illegal "one day" continued to be fought repeatedly, often rebounded and formed a black ticket, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, black nets, etc.
Specifically, illegal street tourists are "black votes " , illegal websites that publish false tourism information are "black nets " , travel agencies engaged in illegal "one day" trips, or institutions or individuals not qualified to operate travel agencies are "black clubs " , and "black guides without a tour permit or in violation of their profession " , which use non-certificated passenger transport vehicles or vehicles with tourist credentials that provide passenger transport services for illegal "one day" trips are "black cars " , and eventually they bring tourists into designated tourist shopping shops "black shops " .
During this special operation, the city has continued to increase regular checks and mobile patrols on illegal "one-day trips" and, in response to the illegal "one-day trips" to high-frequency and high-impact tourist routes, the relevant authorities have sent daily undercover teams to visit the group in order to detect evidence of violations of the law and to investigate them strictly in accordance with the law.
Among them, "black car" and "black shop" became two hard points of action.
Without the black car, it's said, the illegal one-day trip is impossible, and the black car is easy to detect, remember and search, and a single fixed asset of higher value.
The authorities use road traffic monitors to increase the supervision of the bus, which focuses on the "one-day trip" route, to detect the black car in a timely manner, using technical and intellectual means such as physical defence.
The "black shop" of tourist shopping, because of its small number, has become a top priority.
In order to reinforce the deterrent and the deterrent against illegal "one-day trips", the authorities of the special operations, whenever it has been established that a violation has been committed, shall be subject to severe and cumulative penalties in accordance with the law.
In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues relating to the fight against illegal "one-day trips" to discuss measures to combine administrative penalties with convictions.
The City Tourism Council has indicated that more regular travel agencies will be encouraged to undertake a "one day tour" in Beijing in the future, and that more formal "one day swim" will be provided in order to further crowd out the illegal "one day swim" living space, and that specific programmes are currently under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Council has continued to refine the e-TravelList Information System to ensure that each team is included in the regulation of the e-TravelL platform ...
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what has U-town been through all these years?
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Congress, Utsun has received a lot of attention as to how to take on the summit dividend.
Five years since the first World Internet Congress, Utsun has seen changes.
In 2014, there were only 12 Internet-related businesses in town and the digital economy, and by the third quarter of this year there were more than 500 businesses.
It's a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in U-town.
The Internet Congress allowed local firms to accept the digital economy at zero distance, inspired by a digital wave, a strong desire for business transformation and upgrading, and increased investment and research and development by traditional manufacturing firms in machine-changers, smart management, etc.
Secretary Kang Yong of the U Township Party said that U Town would build a new economic empowerment centre in the future.
Development of the digital economy cannot be supported by infrastructure.
This year, Uyghur launched a 5G pilot on the basis of full coverage of the 4G communications network and free WiFi.
At the same time, the city of Kiryu, where the town is located, has become a hot ground for the development of the Internet industry as the first county city in the country to build a dedicated access to international Internet data.
Since the first World Internet Congress, 565 digital economy projects have been introduced, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan, bringing the total value of the core manufacturing sector of the digital economy to 8.73 billion yuan in the first three quarters of the year, representing an increase of 13 per cent in value added.
"Ou Town was a tourist symbol, followed by theatre and cultural symbols... because of the Internet Congress, it is now the Internet and the digital economy symbol... "
In the view of the Secretary of the Kwangang City Council, the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time, and therefore there is an even greater need to build a platform to absorb talent, projects, technology, etc.
Shen Yi, from the village, has worked outside for 20 years, returning home to start a business because of her association with the Internet Congress.
On December 2, last year, with his high-capacity anti-digital modification technology solution, he entered the fourth Internet Light Fair and was favoured by a number of clients.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in U-town not only because of her home country, but " In U-town, it's easier to attract people than I thought, and our applications are fast-tracked, and we have applications in U-town Smart Parking Project... "
A U.S. Boulevard displays the spillover effect of the Internet Congress.
This road to the north and the south of the city is not only a tourist attraction, it's an industrial road.
With it as a base, the U.S. Boulevard was created to meet the conglomerates.
Journalists have learned that, in the future, Uyghur Road will be the leading position in the development of the city ' s industrial sector, leading by the results of a great deal of intellectual medicine, old-age wisdom, intelligent government, and the gathering of industries and many high-level talent that account for 80 per cent of the city ' s GDP.
The tsunami caused by the earthquake in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people.
According to the head of the Public Information Bureau of the Indonesian police in Jakarta on the evening of 29, the current earthquake in Central Sulawesi has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified.
Another 29 people are missing and 540 injured.
Palu airport is still closed.
Active treatment, with 98 per cent of premature child survival in China for 29 weeks and over, has reached the level of developed countries.
The National Children's Medical Center (NCMC) announced on September 30th at the Paediatric Hospital of the University of Gangan that it had introduced Canada's advanced methods into the title "China NiCU Prenatal Quality Improvement Project".
The results of the project show that, after active treatment, 98 per cent of premature births in China over 29 weeks of age have taken place, reaching the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in early delivery without complications in very young babies.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese government has been focusing on the treatment of newborn babies.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per 1,000, significantly below the national average and at advanced levels in developed countries.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, the "China NIOC Project for Pre-natal Quality Improvement of Pre-born Children in Hospital" has significantly improved the quality of survival of pre-born children.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Neonatal Care Unit (NICU) of the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan, told journalists that, while increasing the survival rate of premature births, attention is being paid to reducing the quality of premature child survival, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the overall outcome of neurodevelopment, and improving the overall survival of pre-born children, which is important for improving the overall survival and demographic quality of pre-born children, both within and outside the country, and to the neonatal community, which is also a key concern of the project.
Through four years of sustained efforts to include tens of thousands of premature births of 33 weeks of age and under, the China NICU Pre-natal Quality Improvement Project has resulted in a one-third reduction in the mortality rate of small births and premature births of small birth weight in the country, while the incidence of serious complications of premature births has significantly decreased and the quality of survival of pre-born children has been significantly improved.
The project introduces the concept of collaborative quality improvement through the establishment of a national network of collaborations for the improvement of neonatal quality, the radiation of 25 collaborating hospitals throughout China, the creation of a set of collaborative interventions for the improvement of pre-natal care, the improvement of the integrity of neonatal care, the system and effective methods for the improvement of the quality of collaboration.
The Paediatric Hospital, affiliated to the University of Mudan, is working with the National Newborn Unit to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the project ' s experience and to provide reference and guidance for the regular diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the China Prenatal Quality Improvement Project, the Paediatric Hospital introduced the EPIQ methodology into 25 large NNICUs in 19 provinces of the country, working to address the problem of premature infections in China's neonatal care units.
After more than a decade of improvement, the survival rate of premature births in Canada has increased by about a third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world to expect premature births.
The EPIQ methodology has now been applied to all NIOCs throughout Canada and has been adopted in six countries.
According to the paediatric hospital, two years after EPIQ intervention, premature child infections fell by 35 per cent, while antibiotics use fell by 20 per cent.
In the future, the Paediatric Hospital, affiliated to the University of Gangan, will continue to promote and implement this approach throughout the country, with a view to reducing the incidence of all complications in premature births in general and improving the quality of care for newborns throughout the country.
At this point, there is no doubt that there are differences in the level of treatment and inequality in the various regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important building unit of the National Children ' s Medical Centre, paediatric hospitals will play a radiation-guiding role, and this study will cover several western provinces, including Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal care throughout the country.
It is understood that the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan is working with the National Newborn Unit to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the project ' s experience and to provide reference and guidance for the regular treatment of neonatal infections in China.
In 2019, it was revealed that the focal point, the China Neonatal Collaboration Network, located at the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan, would join 63 hospitals across the country to undertake the next phase of national quality improvement with a view to promoting the development of a level of homogenization of neonatal care in China.
The Director of the Shanghai City Health and Planning Commission expressed alarm that Shanghai could become a central city in the heart of Asia, not only in terms of research, but also in terms of the development of the entire service system, the quality of services and their delivery in Asia, thus truly reflecting China ' s level of health care.
Eternality: Building the "hero memorial" in the heart -- written on the fifth anniversary of the martyr.
On 30 September, on the eve of the birth of the Republic ' s 69th birthday, we had the fifth Martyrs ' Day, where Xi near the Equality Party and the National Leader came to Tiananmen Square to attend a ceremony to honour the people ' s heroes.
At this moment, no matter where you are, please salute the mighty.
It's a day of rejuvenation, and it's a wake-up call.
Turn the history around, and behind every martyr's name is a living life.
They also have hot youth, true love, family.
However, because of their conviction that "the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe " , in order to " save the suffering of the next generation " , they would sacrifice everything they had.
"I live one day and cry for China one day " .
Through time and space, the British set up a spiritual sign to guide the way forward.
From where, from where, from what, from what, from what kind of person, to read English, it's easy to come up with an answer.
It's important to remember the spirits and build a "hero monument" in your heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the Revolutionary War, some 20 million martyrs have lost their lives to national independence, the liberation of the people, and the country ' s wealth and might.
For a variety of reasons, many of the vanguards didn't even leave their names.
Countless blood pours on the ideals, lives on the faiths, remembers their names, passes on their spirits, and protects the roots and spirits of the nation.
This "hero monument" is not subject to any degradation or destruction.
For some time now, there has been a dark stream of historical nihilism, general entertainment and so forth.
All kinds of historical distortions, demeaning practices, challenging the just conscience, miscalculating value judgements, and causing public outrage and alarm in society at large.
You can't be blasphemous. You can't forget your hero.
We must not allow ourselves to touch the bottom line, but we must be bold enough to raise the sword and defend our dignity with justice in accordance with the rule of law.
The Hero Martyrs Protection Act came into force on May 1st of this year.
In judicial practice, there are cases in which verdicts have been very encouraging, both for the effective preservation of the bright and bright image in accordance with the law and for the release of heroic and positive energy.
A people with aspirations cannot have heroes, a country with ideals cannot have pioneers.
The memory of the vanguard, the call for heroes, has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of facilities throughout the country, and more than 100 million visits to Martyrs' Gardens each year.
The human heart is the strongest building block.
Let the heroes, defend the heroes, learn the heroes, love the heroes, integrate the spirit into the blood of the nation, and a "hero monument" will stand between the heavens and the earth.
28 September in Reuters — after Italy ' s defiance of the EU ' s demands and surprise of the market with its massive budget deficit plan, the EU took a non-confrontational position against Italy on Friday, but the EU might take a more radical stance if Italy maintained too ambitious a goal.
The Italian skeptical government’s target of a budget deficit equal to 2.4% of GDP for the next three years suggests that debt has not been cut in the face of a demand for a reduction in the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).
The ECEC Executive Committee for Economic Affairs, Moscovisi, stated on Friday that " we are not interested in the crisis between the EC and Italy " and that " since EU recommendations and sanctions may have little impact on Italy, he has taken a cautious response ...
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy formally submits it to the EC in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in almost two weeks on Friday, and the Italian bond rate reached its highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the ECEC may veto Italy ' s draft budget, something it has never done to any country.
At a meeting later on Friday in Riga, the capital of Latvia, the Vice-President of the EU Executive Committee (EC) said that Italy ' s current financial plan " appears to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Pact " , which refers to the EU ' s financial provisions.
But he didn't say it would trigger a reaction from the EU.
The bidders can submit their applications to participate in this open tender by 26 October of this year.
The Russian Ministry of Agriculture used China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
In May, the Russian Agricultural Supervisory Authority announced that Russian food exports to China for the first time this agricultural year exceeded 1 million tons, an innovation record.
The Bureau predicts that China may enter the top ten Russian food importers.
On September 30th, after the first battle against Cuba at 3:0, the Chinese women's platoon won the Turkish team at 3:0 and won the World Series in 2018.
But Chinese women are more dangerous in this battle than in the first battle.
Twenty-four teams participated in the 2018 Women ' s World Series, with Chinese women in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
From the world ranking and overall strength of Team B, the Turkish and Italian teams are the main rivals of the Chinese team.
When the game started, the Chinese team moved faster to the top, and the game started, maintaining the advantage, putting a lot of pressure on the opponent to take the first round at 25:18.
In the second round, the Turkish team, which was in a tough position, took the lead at 6:2; the Chinese team requested a pause and adjusted its formation to 7 evenly, and then stopped the net scores at 7:0; the Turkish team at the end of the game was at 15:19; the Chinese team was at 24:20, followed by a strong Turkish team at 2 points; and the Chinese team again requested a pause, and took the second round at 25:23 with Joting's running.
In the third round, the situation was very tenuous, and the two sides went up and down to 19 even.
At a critical time, when the Turkish team failed, the Chinese team took the lead at 21:19 and obtained the point at 24:21 with Ju Ting's heavy arrest and Zhang Changning's attack; then the Turkish team ran the score to 23:24, the Chinese team requested a pause, Zhang Chang Ning hit the score, and the Chinese team won at 25:23.
The whole game wasn't easy.
"We're better prepared, we're better off, the Turkish team is more sophisticated, and we have to mitigate our mistakes and try to win through our own initiative... "
In the face of the familiar teammates, Jo Ting, who worked for the Turkish Vakivo Bank team, was subjected to a lot of restrictions in the first round of the game that day, and she then volunteered for change and continued her aggressive attack.
"We are familiar with each other, and it is normal to be watched, but the Chinese team is extremely active, and both the net and the attack are doing well in the face of bad news..."
Next, the Chinese women's platoon will hold a truce for physical and technical training; on October 2, they will meet the third rival, the Canadian team.
On the 30th of September of the 30th, a ceremony was held in the Hebei district where the priority projects began in the second half of 2018.
On that day, six projects were concentrated, with a total investment of RMB 4.29 billion.
On that day, Deputy Mayor Yang Shikun, of the Standing Committee of the Water and Sanitation Committee, announced the start of work.
According to Mr. Yao, Director of the Hebei High School Management Board, the six projects that had been launched today, with a total investment of $4.29 billion, were industrial projects, ranging from the upgrading of traditional industries to the introduction of new and emerging industries, covering such sectors as civil-military integration, cloud factories, food, medicine, chemicals, high technological content of projects, high levels of industry and higher value added of products.
It is believed that the construction and commissioning of these projects will provide a strong impetus to the early realization of the goal of building hundreds of billions of industrial parks to create high-rise areas at the national level.
Deputy Mayor Yang Shikun, Standing Committee of the Water and Sanitation Committee, announced the start of the project.
Happily Yao said that the region had successfully launched the China-Shang Shui International Life Science Summit and the Great Health Industry Development Forum, the Chinese Academy of Sciences High-end Equipment Industry Meeting, the 2018 "Symbiosis" Innovation Forum, and had made great efforts to develop new materials and energy, health, and high-end equipment to create three strategic and new industries.
The Chinese-American stem cell project will be officially operational by the end of the year.

Nearly a thousand state-owned areas have reduced the price of tickets by more than half by more than 20 per cent.
[Summary] As of 28 September, 981 landscape areas have been declared free of charge or price reduction measures (74 free of charge and 907), including Yunnan Shilin, Dalian 3 towers, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guangxi Guiling River, Fujian Wuhua Mountains, Hunan Zhang Ji Jiji border, Zhang Quan, Jiangxi Sanhing Mountain and Xinjiang Karnas.
In follow-up to the Central Economic Work Conference and the deployment of the Government's report on its work, the National Development Reform Commission issued, on 28 June, a "Guidance on improving the mechanism for the pricing of tickets in State-owned areas and reducing the price of tickets in priority State-owned areas " (hereinafter referred to as the guidance), which calls for improving the mechanism for the formation of tickets in State-owned areas, in terms of a reasonable definition of the cost of gate price pricing, innovative price management, strict compliance with the pricing procedures, and ensuring that by the end of September, the price of tickets in high State-owned areas is reduced to a significant degree.
Actively working in accordance with deployment requirements has led to successively lower prices for tickets to key State-owned areas.
As of 28 September, 981 sites (74 free of charge and 907 reduced prices) had been declared free of charge or price-cutting measures in place or issued to the public. Of these, 5A, 159, 4A, 534 and 693 or 70.6 per cent.
Of the 907 areas where prices were reduced, 491 or 54.3 per cent were reduced by more than 20 per cent and 214 or 23.6 per cent by more than 30 per cent.
The provinces of Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi and Shaanxi have a higher number of price zones, of which Yunnan has more than 100, with an overall decrease of more than 30 per cent.
Anhui, Chongqing and the 8 provincial (district, city) government priced the entire 5A floor area down.
The high-profile Yunnan Ishi Lam, Tai Li Santa, Yu Long Snow Mountain, Guangxi Guiling River, Fujimei Wumai Mountain, Hunan Zhang family border, Shanxi soldiers, Jiangxi Sanqing Mountain, Xinjiang Kanas, etc.
The gradual return of the prices of tickets to priority State-owned sites to reasonable areas has contributed to the acceleration of tourism from the gate economy to the industrial economy, to the tourism of small groups to the general public, to the upgrading of destination tourism to the global tourism sector, to the creation of a virtuous cycle of optimal tourism supply structure and steadily expanding demand for tourism consumption, and to the sustained healthy development of the landscape and tourism industry.
At the same time, the National Development Reform Commission has emphasized the need to strengthen price order norms in the landscape, to guide the upgrading of services in the landscape and to ensure that price reductions do not drop.
In addition, the National Development Reform Commission has carried out special surveillance of recent media reports on the low and apparent decline in the prices of individual tickets in the landscape, requiring serious local responses to social concerns in a timely manner and the effective implementation of price reductions.
The Trade and Development Board has an orderly approach to short-, medium- and long-term optimization
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Agency has submitted short-, medium- and long-term optimization reports on "Major Investment Immigrants" and "Technology Immigrants" and, in addition to intensifying the promotion and implementation of the work in the report, is continuously listening to society and optimizing the content of the report and related work.
The Trade and Development Bureau will brief all sectors of society as soon as possible on relevant optimization efforts.
Five were short-term measures in the course of the year; five were medium-term measures in 2019; and one was long-term.
In addition, the Trade Promotion Bureau has been instructed by the Director of the Department of Economics and Finance, Liang Witt, to conduct a comprehensive review of the internal management system.
The five short-term measures undertaken during the year include:
1. Conduct of a review process. Give priority to cases that are due to expire at the end of seven years, the cases referred to in the ICAC report, and the cases of new renewals. In cases where evidence of irregularities or violations is found, the relevant judicial authorities will be brought forward on their own initiative for follow-up;
2. Field visits to projects involving "Major Investment Migrants". By late September, more than 20 investment projects had been visited;
3. A comprehensive review of the current system of evaluation. Six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been re-established in the evaluation of applications for "major investment migrants" and, in the evaluation of applications for "technology migrants", approval mechanisms will be improved by identifying elements conducive to the development of the country and prioritizing the admission of personnel. A list of "10 jobs in the five sectors" has been drawn up as an annual priority for the introduction of talent, in line with the HKSAR Government's policy direction, in order to better target the recruitment of talent;
4. Increased transparency of information. This includes the planned gradual publication of approval guidelines, rating criteria and weights, as well as further refinement and public approval of data, starting in the fourth quarter of this year;
5. In terms of refining the work of the confirmation mechanism, prior confirmation of the status of work in Australia has been requested; significant investments must be verified on site and financial statements submitted.
The five medium-term measures implemented in 2019 include:
1. Establishment of a mechanism to hear the views of the Commission on Talent Development and the Economic Development Commission on a regular basis.
2. Requires the applicant to submit annually financial statements made by an independent third party to keep the operation of the investment project under review;
3. Further standardization and electronicization of the process for the application and approval of individual cases in order to reduce human error;
4. Conduct a comprehensive review of the current staffing situation in order to complement the implementation of a number of optimization measures;
5. Step up research on the revision of the "temporary residence regime for investors, managers and specially qualified technicians".
With regard to the long-term measures to intensify the study of the law, it is expected that the drafting of legislation will take place in the first half of 2019, with a view to finalizing as soon as possible the criteria for the granting of temporary residence permits, the review mechanism and the confirmation mechanism, as well as the investigation function of the Trade and Promotion Bureau, in order to improve the accuracy of the processing and supervision of applications for temporary residence permits.
The national experts in the field of observation and exchange of seminars and research in the cotton-free zone entered the test field to hear a presentation by the representative of the Chinese Engineering Academy team.
On September 30th, China's new Xinjiang Shaya power station in Xinjiang Shaya County is located on a test site of invincible cotton growing, "no less bad" than next to the membrane cotton, and a white cotton race is "open" with branches full of twigs.
From 27 to 28 September, a national on-site observation and discussion exchange on the membrane cotton was held in Xinjiang Shaya County.
During the videoconference, journalists learned that the immeasurable cotton technology system, which is dominated by the Chinese cotton 619 and its accompanying cultivation measures, has initially achieved the goal of immeasuration of cotton fields, has reduced the contamination of the ecological environment and raw cotton by the Xinjiang cotton film, and has made significant progress in research and demonstration of the integrated membrane cotton technology.
Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder, and Chief Scientist of the cotton system of the National System of Modern Agricultural Industries, Mr. Shijima, gave a presentation on the development of membrane cotton to the Secretary of the Zhejiang Agro-Lin University School Party, Mr. Zhou Kum.
" The combination of membrane cotton technologies that we have developed can fully achieve non-membrane cotton cultivation and can completely solve the problem of membrane contamination and achieve green cotton planting... "
The Chinese Academy of Engineering has a quick introduction.
Xinjiang, the most important cotton-producing area in China, accounted for 61 per cent of the country ' s cotton area in 2017, according to the National Statistics Office.
Since the introduction of the membrane in China in 1982, Xinjiang has had over 50 million acres of crop cover of all types and about 300,000 tons of membrane use per year.
Of this, cotton membrane coverage reached 100%, and cotton-field membrane accounted for about 60% of the use of the membrane in Xinjiang.
The membrane cotton is measured to produce 320 to 350 kg acre.
As the amount of Xinjiang membrane inputs increases, residual membrane recovery rates are low, the amount of film residues in the soil is gradually increasing, and a range of problems, such as the structural destruction of the soil caused by the membranes, seriously affect sustainable agricultural development.
The membranes not only cause significant contamination of the soil, but also have a significant impact on the quality of cotton fibres.
At present, more than a third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang are mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang's Xinjiang aircraft collected about 14 million acres of cotton.
During the mechanical cotton harvesting process, a large amount of ground surfaces were collected, filtrations on cotton strains were mixed in the original cotton, which were difficult to remove during the processing of the original cotton, and also during subsequent textile processing, which severely affected the quality of textile products.
On September 28th, a national on-site observation and discussion exchange on the membrane cotton was held in Xinjiang Shaya County.
In an effort to address the problem of cotton land contamination, simplify cotton-planting techniques, and improve cotton-field efficiency, Hispanic led his team through eight years to implement the "Chinese cotton 619" anti-membrane technology, adding to Xinjiang's green agricultural development."
A metaphoric introduction to the development of new ideas through innovative seedings that produce very early, salt-resistant, low-temperature, high-yielding cotton on the land is called "Smart 619 " .
" `Chinese Cotton 619' has achieved a range of measures, such as mechanically equipped filmless seeding in the southern part of Xinjiang under filmless cultivation, improved depth of seeding, shallow burial of drip tubes under membrane conditions, suitable screening of seed density, reasonable chemical regulation, etc. ... "
Currently, demonstration bases have been set up in Aksu, Kurle, Alar, etc., producing 4,800 kg per hectare.
Cotton growing without membrane, high yields, savings, environmental protection, combined efficiency gains.
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, Third Division, Agronomy Department, Zhang Dang Hai said that through research and demonstration of filmless cotton cultivation techniques over the past six years, the production of corny cotton seeds would be 320 to 350 kg, possibly even higher.
" There are great prospects for the diffusion of the technology of membrane cotton cultivation... "
Zhang Jinghai believes that the current technology of membrane cotton cultivation can solve the problem of soil magnesium contamination once and for all, but that there is still a gap between the economic benefits of membrane cultivation and the benefits of membrane cultivation.
" Support for cotton purchase prices will be conducive to future promotion... "
He and his team will continue to conduct in-depth studies and wide-scale extension applications of the membrane cotton industry as the next step in addressing the soil pollution caused by the membrane.

The General Directorate of Market Supervision has recently issued a " Notice on Strengthening the Regulation of Market Prices during the Mid-Autumn Day of 2018 " , which calls for the strengthening of price regulation in the area of housing rental and real estate, the strict regulation of rent collusiveness, the hoarding of rental sources, the fabrication of false information to raise rents, the imposition of arbitrary fees by binding services, the publication of misleading price information, and the violation of prices such as the price of unknown codes.
The circular makes it clear that the early warning of price monitoring should be enhanced and that market price developments should be closely followed.
Close attention should be paid to the basic necessities of food and oil consumption, such as egg milk salt, as well as to market and price changes for special commodities consumed by the local population on the occasion of the holiday, and to improved price monitoring and early warning analysis.
Once market volatility trends and emerging issues are identified, timely measures are taken to address them effectively.
Increased monitoring and supervision of the wholesale retailing of necessities of life, the frequency of monitoring and supervision of places that are closely linked to the daily consumption of people, such as the market for agriculture and trade, and the need to ensure that operators operate in good faith in compliance with the law ...
The circular states that the priority areas will be strengthened to create a favourable consumer environment; that the state-owned landscape will be better regulated in terms of prices; that the state-owned landscape will not implement government-mandated price levels or floating margins, and will focus on illegal violations such as non-compliance with government-mandated price levels or fees, increasing the price of tickets by means of irregularities, such as tickets to "garde gardens", high pricing discounts, tied sales, non-compliance with prescribed specifications, non-favourable measures, price additions, mandatory surcharges, etc.
The notification requirement is to strengthen the regulation of prices of essential goods, especially agricultural products.
Recent fluctuations in the prices of essential agricultural products such as vegetables, pork, etc., in some areas, affected by seasonal variations, natural disasters and outbreaks.
Locally, market price regulation for agricultural by-products needs to be strengthened in a manner that takes into account local realities, while the relevant sectors take advantage of stable production and market supply, and organize efforts to carry out market-focused and random inspections.
Increased scrutiny of commodities such as fast-priced pork, and serious investigation of illegal practices such as hoarding Gucci, pushing prices up and collusively increasing prices.
The circular states that the regulation of prices in the area of housing rental and real estate should be strengthened.
In mid-Autumn, when housing rentals and sale of goods coincide, it is important to pay close attention to the price behaviour of real estate enterprises, intermediaries and housing rental-related enterprises, to severely regulate rental price collusion, to hoard rental sources, to fabricate false information to raise rents, to impose a price in a way that binds services, to publish misleading price information, price violations such as price codes such as unknown codes, to increase the scrutiny of price labels in hot-marketed buildings and real estate intermediaries, to investigate consumer interests such as the failure to comply with the requirement to apply a "one-point set" to disrupt the market order, to cleanse the real estate market environment, to create an open and transparent price order in the real estate market.
The circular refers to the need for effective local regulation of prices in other parts of the tourism industry, with a focus on regulating catering, accommodation, shopping, sightseeing, entertainment, parking, etc., and guidance for operators on price specifications, fee publicity, and serious investigation of price violations of all kinds.
The circular states that the price of transport, such as roads, railways, civil aviation, water transport, etc., should be increased, and that violations, such as price increases, extra-price charges and non-fixed pricing, should be seriously investigated.
Implement a "green passage" policy for the transportation of fresh agricultural products and free minibus tolls for major holidays.

Ex-Foreign Aid charged with playing a fake ball, North Control responding, "No need to have it."
Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing Holdings Football Club (hereinafter referred to as North) responded officially to the team ' s former foreign aider Anechbe ' s allegation that the team was suspected of playing false football. North Control issued a statement stating that there was absolutely no such thing as playing false football on the part of the club, and that this was a complete fabrication made by Anechbe himself in the course of the arbitration to cover up the fact that he was in flagrant violation of the contract and for his own improper economic purposes.
At the same time, the North Controls state that they will reserve the right to be held accountable by all means ...
According to the British Daily Post, Nigerian player Anechbe accused FIFA of being suspected of playing false football by his Beijing North Control team last year, including Beijing Derby in the 21st round of the 2017 season.
It was a crucial stage in Beijing and the rush, and the game of North control ended with a zero-two down against the Beijingers and the Anitcheby first.
There was an official response from the North Control Club yesterday to this Nigerian player's story.
According to the statement, after an internal investigation prior to the club, there was no false play in the game in which the team participated.
Anachebe joined Beijing North in June 2017. In December of the same year, Anachebe refused to join the team for winter training without any justification and refused to do so despite numerous reminders from the club.
The dispute between the parties has now been referred to FIFA and arbitration is ongoing.
The statement also mentioned that the high-profile "false ball charge" was in fact a lie that Anechbe had made in the course of arbitration in order to cover up the fact that he was in flagrant violation of the contract and for his personal and unjust economic purposes.
The only purpose of his slanderous club and his defamation of Chinese football is to gain unjust economic benefits.
Clubs are less open to any organization or any individual who, for the sake of their economic well-being, blames the club with false accusations, slanders, slanders, slanders and slanders.
Therefore, the Northern Controls indicated that they would reserve the right to hold the parties to account by all means ...
The Chinese Agricultural Development Bank will invest 20 billion yuan to support the Gilin Qiu food acquisition.
Since September, crop harvests have continued in various parts of Jilin Province.
Journalists have learned from the Jilin provincial branch of the China Agricultural Development Bank that agricultural loans are now fully available in the amount of $20 billion to ensure the availability of sufficient funds for food purchases in Jilin Qiu.
It is known that this year the food production situation in Jilin was generally stable, with some food processing enterprises increasing their capacity, starting rates and demand for food markets.
In order to ensure the availability of funds for food policy acquisition, agricultural issuances have been actively engaged in the Autumn Food Acquisitions Bank meetings through visits to farmers, processing enterprises, trading enterprises, etc.
At present, the agricultural distribution has invested 5.2 billion yuan to support the purchase of 1.58 billion pounds of autumn grain by various food buyers.
There are 120 major food-buyers in Jilin Province with nearly 300 acquisition sites, ensuring full coverage of the main food-producing districts, without leaving the acquisition funds at the "blank " point " .
According to the head of the farm distribution agency, in accordance with the progress of the acquisition and the demand for money from the enterprise, in the event of a shortage of funds for the acquisition, the farm distribution will apply for an additional $20 billion in credit funds to ensure that the funds are provided in a timely and adequate manner, that the food market is stable and that the interests of farmers are protected.
Chinese journalists will be taken away by the police in the year of the British Conservative Party. China asks for an apology.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, the spokesman for the British Embassy answered the questions of a Chinese journalist who had been taken by the police during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party on the first day.
The speaker stated that we asked the Conservative Human Rights Committee to stop interfering in China ' s internal affairs, to stop interfering in Hong Kong and to ask the organizers of the conference to apologize to Chinese journalists.
Questions were asked by journalists: on 30 September, during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party, the party ' s Human Rights Committee held a side event on Hong Kong and invited the Hong Kong opposition to speak.
A Chinese journalist was taken by the police during the meeting.
Do you have any comments?
In response, he said that over the 21 years since Hong Kong returned to its homeland, the "one country, two systems" practice had been a great success and Hong Kong's development achievements had been universally recognized.
Hong Kong is Hong Kong, China, and Hong Kong affairs are purely internal to China.
The Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party has used the party's annual meeting to organize a side event to raise awareness of the anti-Chinese separatist forces, and China expresses its grave concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We firmly reject any organization that interferes in Hong Kong affairs in any way.
Any attempt or action to promote "Hong Kong independence" is futile.
It was totally unacceptable, according to the speaker, that freedom of expression had always been proclaimed in the United Kingdom, but when Chinese journalists asked questions at the side meeting to express their views, they had been prevented from doing so, even physically.
We demand that the Conservative Human Rights Committee stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, and that the organizers apologize to Chinese journalists.

China’s Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking on Friday in the United States Foreign Relations Committee, said that China’s relations with the United States were now once again at a crossroads, and that a better future could be opened if both sides viewed each other positively, deepened positive cooperation and properly managed differences.
"Chinese-American relations are our common asset, and we need to take care of them together..."
He expressed the hope that all sectors of the two countries would be well-informed and act to preserve the healthy and stable development of relations between China and the United States, and that they would move forward in the right direction.
Wang Yi also stressed once again that China must move out of a development path that is different from that of the traditional powers.
This Chinese-characteristic path determines that China will not and will not be in the same position as the United States. It also determines that China will not become the United States, will not challenge the United States, and will not replace the United States.
In his speech entitled "Opportunities or Challenges, Partners or Counterparts", Wang Yi said that the deep problem at hand was that some American friends believed that China would be strong and powerful and would even challenge and replace the United States as a leader in the world.
"This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation..."
He claims, however, that this perceived suspicion is spreading and magnifying the contradictions, creating new doubts and making it more difficult to solve specific problems between the United States and China and encountering more resistance.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is on a path to peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had the genes for external expansion.
We believe that nations can live together in harmony and mutual understanding.
In the past, in the present and in the future, China will neither replicate the foreign model nor ask others to replicate its practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met former US Secretary of State Kissinger in New York, he said that US-China cooperation would win, and fighting would lose both.
China has always been committed to the development of long-term healthy and stable relations between China and the United States, to the achievement of non-conflict and non-confrontational relations, mutual respect and cooperation.

She's been in Shenzhen this time, with ease of customs clearance, half her time, and the Hong Kong section of her journey is more impressive. She says to reporters: " It's like she's on a subway, especially fast, and I've never been able to take a picture before! "
On September 23rd, at 6:44, the G5711 "Harm" high train left from Shenzhen North Station for a quick drive, and a few minutes later, the train entered Hong Kong, the first high-speed train officially operated in Hong Kong.
Incorporation into the country ' s 25,000-km high-iron network, which reaches 38 long-distance stations in Hong Kong, and also attracts passengers from the interior of different provinces in the north of the country.
Mr. Gao, visiting his family from Changsha to Hong Kong, told the reporter that he was happy when he came home to have lunch with his children.
He said that the "two-by-one" clearance process was more convenient than ever, "in less than 10 minutes, both have passed."

Ms. Wu from Fujian is going to visit the Philippines from Hong Kong for a golden week, and she is about to point out her luggage at the West Kowloon and says to reporters: " I was afraid I'd miss the plane. I didn ' t think it would be too soon. "
The new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain the ability of US President Trump to implement the 25 per cent tariff threat on imported cars, while at the same time providing for a general exemption from customs duties on passenger vehicles, pickups and car parts imported from Canada and Mexico, according to the TTA subsidiary arrangement published on Monday.
If Trump imposed so-called "Chapter 232" tariffs on cars for reasons of national security, Mexico and Canada would have an exemption quota of 2.6 million cars per year from taxes to the United States.
Piccards produced in both countries will be completely exempted from customs duties under subsidiary arrangements.
If the Trumpuga tariff were imposed, Mexico would receive an exemption from the tax on car parts of $108 billion a year, and Canada would receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
Both quotas are well above the current levels of production in both countries and provide room for growth in exports from both countries.
Reuters/Mexico, 28 September - Mexico Friday stated that, after several days of controversy, the Government of United States President Trump and Canada were making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, giving the hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would be maintained in the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite the lack of detail, the above obvious progress is sufficient to prompt the Governments of Mexico and the United States to abruptly suspend their plans to publish the text of the trade agreement between them and to give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexico's President-designate, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, told journalists in Mexico that the United States Government had made new counter-proposals to the Canadian Government and that he would continue to press for the participation of all three countries in NAFTA.
The Minister of the Economy of Mexico, Ildefonso Guajardo, stated that the submission of the text of the US-Memorn trade agreement to Mexican and United States legislation had been delayed because the Canadian and United States Governments had tried "very seriously" to reach an agreement.
Guaharto said, " In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a tripartite agreement or whether we have to publish the text of the agreement between the two parties ... "
Guahardo said that his American and Canadian counterparts had "specially requested" to delay the release of the text.
The spokesperson for the United States Trade Representative Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the US-Medical Trade Agreement and the consultation between the United States and Canada.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comments on counter-proposals.
According to the foreign media, in a care centre on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa's capital, two young lions play together, and it's hard to see anything out of the ordinary, but they're nothing.
The University of Pretoria declared: " This is the first young lion ever born by artificial insemination - the first pair of lions in the world... "
School scientists are working on the reproductive system of the female African lion.
The Director of the Mammal Institute of the University of Pretoria, Gans Winter, said that the two young lions, one male and one female, born on 25 August, were healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally made this breakthrough.
" We collect sperm from a healthy lion... " .
Next, the researcher uses artificial insemination when the hormone content in the female is at the right level.
" Fortunately, the results have been successful... "
He said, "Researchers have tried several times, but unexpectedly, they haven't spent much effort."
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthroughs could be repeated and that scientists wanted to use the technology to save the endangered giant cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), lions are extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of wild lions that survive has fallen by 43% in the last 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
African lions are classified by this organization as vulnerable animals.
" If we don't do something for these animals, they'll be extinct... "
He said that the new technology did not have to be raised by lions, but simply injected sperm into pregnant lions, just as North America and Europe had done to raise elephants.
South Korea ' s exports declined the most in September in the past two years, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer days of work, stating that global demand for Korean commodities remained strong despite rising trade tensions between the United States and Central America.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, the earlier release of the opening data showed a double-digit increase in exports in the first weeks of September prior to the extended vacation period.
South Korea ' s exports in September fell by the largest in the same year since July 2016, by 5.7 per cent more than estimated by 11 Reuters analysts.
The opening values announced on Monday showed exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
Despite fears that a growing trade dispute between China and the United States could cause other export-dependent China’s neighbours to suffer, South Korea’s exports to China grew by 7.8 per cent in September, expanding for the first 23 months in a row.
South Korea's exports to the United States fell by 11.8 per cent, due to a decline in sales of petroleum products.
The overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products grew by 28.3 per cent and 13.5 per cent, respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called chip "supercycle" might be at its peak.
" However, the effects of the trade conflict will be inevitable, as South Korean exports depend heavily on the United States and Chinese markets ... "
Imports fell by 2.1 per cent to $40.8 billion, less than the 3.1 per cent increase projected by the Reuters Survey.
The trade surplus in September began with $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Ministry of Industry, thanks to the United States and the European Union, the global manufacturing industry will continue to flourish, which is a favourable factor for Korean exports.
The statement states that " higher export prices resulting from higher oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year ... "
" However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with increased market volatility following the rise in interest rates in the United States, are all negative pressures on exports ... "
Exports increased from an average of $2.6 billion per working day in September to $2.1 billion in August.
Korea's mid-autumn season fell from 24 to 26 September this year, so there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than in the same period last year.
Korea ' s exports grew 4.7 per cent in January-September compared to the same period last year.
According to the Japan/Market purchasing manager index, manufacturing activity in Korea recovered in September, but was supported by domestic orders, which fell from China and Japan, threatening to cast a shadow over export prospects.
North Korean media criticizes the US for not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK.
North Korea's "Labour News" published an op-ed article on September 30, criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea while not relaxing sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, calling it a "compromise".
According to the article, the United States Secretary of State, Pompeyo, "the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the implementation of sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea " , stressing that the United States ' continued implementation of United Nations sanctions resolutions remains unchanged.
In the Singapore-United States Joint Statement, the two sides committed themselves to a new relationship between the DPRK and the United States commensurate with the aspirations of the two peoples to peace and prosperity ...
There is no doubt that it is contradictory for the United States to increase the pressure on sanctions and demand dialogue.
The article states that if a new DPRK-US relationship is to be established, a permanently consolidated peace regime is to be built on the Korean peninsula, and the Korean peninsula is to be completely denuclearization, confidence-building should be given first priority, starting with what can be done, with a phased solution, one by one.
The article also states that the United States should understand that sanctions are not going to work for North Korea.
According to the article, even the North Devinsk before the Kazan is a compliment to the American army.
"We'll meet a powerful potential opponent. Just look at the North Devinsk. "
The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, Fogell, also praised the North Devinsk.
He said: " This submarine is impressive... Seeing how the Russian navy is developing, how resources are used will know that its main efforts in research and development are, first and foremost, the strengthening of the submarine fleet ... "
But National Interest still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
Forgo said: " I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages ... "
There were earlier reports that the Russian Navy would be loading the Kazan submarine in 2019.
Kazan, Nueva Siberia, Krasnoyarsk, Alhangarsk multi-purpose submarines with improved white wax tree-M, drainage of 13,800 tons, depth of 520 metres, staffing of 64 personnel, underwater speed of 31 knots, will carry torpedoes, torpedoes and calibres, and a cruise missile called "Zamanau".
On 29 September, the General Directorate of Radio and Television (Sinjing News) issued a " Notice on the development of a special radio and television advertising campaign " , which has been under way since that date until the end of the year.
The reform consists of low-quality, high-quality and low-quality advertisements, medical feeding programmes that are broadcast without record-keeping.
According to the circular, the focus of this special treatment is on nine areas.
These include: advertisements with low content, low tone and low quality; advertising with excessive time and non-prescription; advertisements with exaggerated and false publicity, misleading audiences, or advertising with a programme pattern, such as medical treatment, medicines, medical devices, health foods, cosmetics, beauty, etc., and medical feeding programmes with unmanaged and unrecorded broadcasts; advertising with exaggerated and false publicity, misleading the audience, attracting the audience to a negotiated alliance on a defrauded issue, investing in money, collecting goods, etc., with expected returns on investment; advertisements with incentives to create undesirable behaviour or to create undesirable values that harm the physical and mental health of minors; advertisements with long public service announcements, which do not meet the required requirements; poor advertising management systems, which examine irregularities and responsibilities; advertising with other irregularities.
This process will be carried out throughout the country, with the full implementation of the requirements of regulation and regulation in the wide media at all levels, the frequency of the channels, the programmes and the time slots, " No blind areas, no dead spots, no exceptions " .
The circular requires that the various types of illegal advertising found in the supervision and inspection be dealt with by the authorities at all levels of the electricity and electricity administration in strict accordance with the General Directorate's "Code for the Treatment of Non-compliance by Radio and Television Broadcasters".
If the violation is serious, a disclaimer is given, criticisms are notified, advertising is suspended until the frequency channel is suspended, and public exposure to society, as appropriate.
In recent years, the General Directorate of Radio has called for the suspension of illegal advertising.
This year, the General Directorate of National Radio and Television issued a circular calling for the closure of advertisements for serious irregularities, such as "O-Cubourte" "Sava cocktail" and "Bonrett Plant Prophylaxis" and exaggeration.
The General Directorate of Radio and Telecommunications has developed a number of regulations and circulars to regulate advertising on radio and television.
"Announcement to further strengthen the management of television shopping spots on the Via Video Channel" stipulates that television shopping spots should not be aired from 1800 hours to 2400 hours per day.
In other slots, television shopping spots are advertised without the use of a moderator, "sale" exaggerations, tone, movement, etc., orthopaedics, " plastics " , "fats " or disguised publicity, "lips " , "fats " or "blowing" and "fats" and diets, and television shopping spots should not be aired more than 1 (twice) per hour per day, and not more than 3 minutes per article.
"Notification to further strengthen the management of broadcast of radio and television advertisements" stipulates that television stations must strictly comply with General Directorate Order No. 61 when advertising in the middle of a film show: two commercials in non-gold hours (in 45 minutes) may be inserted for a maximum of 1 minute and 30 seconds each; one commercial in each concentration of gold time (1900 to 21:00) shall be inserted for a maximum of 1 minute; advertising should be advertised for a period of not more than 1 minute.
The circular also stipulates that broadcasters must strictly examine the qualifications of health information advertisements, such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, health-care foods, certification, etc., and firmly prohibit the broadcasting of sex-related advertisements.
To regulate the form of health information advertising, no disguised advertising in the form of health information features.
Health information features should focus on scientific knowledge such as disease prevention, control and treatment. They must not contain advertisements such as information on medicine, medicines, medical devices, health-care foods, or evidence in the name of patients and doctors, pharmacists, specialists, etc.
Mantourov said: " For the first time, we have adapted the format of the MAKS International Aerospace Sharon. ... We recommend China as a host country. ... The Chinese colleague agreed and accepted our invitation... "
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the Fourth Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Putin.
It's his first time at the Forum.
Disregard the American threat!
EU or Iran to enter into a crude oil procurement agreement
The United States Government recently announced that a new round of sanctions against Iran would be relaunched in November and even urged other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil ...
But American allies don't seem to listen.
According to the United States New York Times, on 29 September, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed that, despite the United States threat to impose sanctions on any country doing business with Iran, Tehran was approaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil.
The central purpose of this agreement is to attempt to create a new payment mechanism that replaces United States dollar transactions by bartering or local currency denominated.
The purpose of this approach is to hope to bypass the United States and prevent it from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the promotion of the agreement, some French and British officials are concerned that, if the agreement were to materialize, it would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran-nuclear agreement.
According to the media, Zarif sounds more optimistic in an hour than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the power to strip away the traditional allies of the United States and effectively break the American attempt to cut Iranian revenues.
" This ensures that we sell oil and benefit from it " , which, in Zarif ' s view, has a legitimate right to trade with Iran in accordance with the agreement reached in 2015 ...
The European Union Foreign Policy Officer Federica Mogherini also stated before that " no sovereign State or organization can accept others to decide with whom they can trade ... "
However, she also predicted that, before the next sanctions were imposed by the United States Government in November, United States leaders might resort to a range of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries with businesses in Tehran.
In May this year, the United States Government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed and stated that it could not permanently prohibit the production of nuclear fuel by Iran ...
The United States subsequently threatened to ban companies buying Iranian oil and other commodities from operating in the United States.
This threat led to the evacuation of some companies from Tehran and the collapse of the Iranian currency.
Airbus and French oil giant Dadal have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said that the U.S. government might "take the upper hand " .
If not, according to a recent Turkish media report, the sanctions imposed by the United States do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iran's oil exports ...
Iran's oil minister, Xanqane, has recently revealed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that a series of acts by the United States were intended to "entice" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif, too, was concerned about a series of verbal attacks by the United States, and when asked whether the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, " It is a strategy of regime change, and that is the real purpose of the United States... "

Journalists have learned from the National Commission on Health and Hygiene that the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents has declined and the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly in the country compared to decades ago.
In this regard, experts pointed out that the most important idea of maintaining healthy weight is to " cure disease " , to promote scientific fitness and a reasonable diet.
According to the Chinese Youth Health Education Core Information and Interpretations (2018) published recently by the National Health Commission, the key to maintaining healthy weight is reasonable diet and science.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not good for health.
The health risks behind Fatty can't be ignored.
The director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Ding Jing Jianxiang, said that overweight obesity was a danger to the normal growth and development of young people and had a negative effect on their psychology, behaviour, cognitive and intellectual abilities, even leading to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat.
At the same time, overweight obesity among adolescents can easily continue into adulthood, increasing the risk of high blood pressure and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, among adolescents as adults ...
According to Jing Jing, the nutritional and health tests of Chinese residents in 2010-2012 showed that the rate of overweight among children aged 6-17 was 9.6 per cent in China and 6.4 per cent in obesity, which together was 16 per cent.
At the same time, overweight obesity among children and adolescents is more prevalent among boys than girls, in urban than in rural areas, and the overweight obesity rate has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do adolescents cope with overweight obesity?
According to Zhang, Deputy Director of the Centre for Scientific Physics and Health Promotion of the National Directorate of Sports, the main causes of obesity among young people are excessive heat intake and inadequate physical activity.
For this simple obesity, you need to focus on science and rational diet control.
According to Zhang, the most important concept of maintaining healthy body weight is " cure for disease " , which is important in the context of a comprehensive general education of schools, parents and students, the spread of overweight and obesity, and the promotion of prevention among adolescents.
Young people should undergo regular medical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as body weight and early detection, scientific diagnosis of overweight and obesity for timely intervention ...
For young people who are already overweight, Jinxeng recommends that, in addition to the active scientific organization of meals and sports, young people are in a special physiological stage and that they avoid using hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce their weight, and that they not blindly take diet drugs ...

Following the implementation of the new regulations, the security plan is issued once a day at 9 a.m. and 21 p.m., and the dam plan is issued once a day at 14 p.m. and at 20 p.m., allowing ships the flexibility to arrange the dam plan.
The "Movement Control" has added the "Class Control" principle for the movement of ships by daming ships with a clear priority based on the anchoring and lifter function, and the short-line passenger ships by the gate have been adjusted to the same level of priority as the model and good-faith vessels.
That's two weeks after the lift runs, we're officially in the same position as the gate.
For the first time, the new energy-powered ships have also been prioritized by the Grand Long Wide Demonstration Ship of the Kawajiang and the San Gorge Bank.
At the same time, the "Movement Control Protocol" adjusted the "Movement Management Water" from the previous 180-km near dam to 541.8 km of Yunyang River Bridge to Ishi River Bridge, and divided the "core waters, dam waters, control waters, dispatch waters " .
This would facilitate the ship ' s choice of suitable waters for locking and reduce the backlog of ships waiting in dam areas.
The "Movement Order" also provides for good faith restrictions such as the cancellation of a vessel's declaration of breach, the delay in crossing a dam by 24 hours, based on the current ship's dyke, the waiting features of the lockdown.
As a result of the three gorges ' water harvesting, the conditions of navigation in the reservoir area have improved, contributing to the rapid development of the Yangtze shipping.
According to the data, the annual cargo traffic at the three gorges and the Goose Dam gates increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons in 2017, respectively.
For two years, the Tribute has been on board 5767 ships, with 16.22 million passengers and a cargo volume of 1.7128 million tons.
According to Chen Dong Won, Deputy Director General of the Three Gorges Navigation Authority, the "Movement Control" has a positive effect on promoting integrity through the gates, maintaining traffic order in the two dam hubs, defusing pressure from vessels in the dam area and improving navigation capability.

With the approval of Prime Minister Li Keqiang, the State Department recently issued a " Decision on the Regulation of the List of Licences for the Production of Industrial Products for Further Depression and Simplified Approval Procedures " .
"Decision" proposes to further depress the catalogue of industrial production licences, to eliminate 14 categories of industrial production licences and to delegate the authority for the management of four categories of industrial production licences to the Quality Technical Supervision Department of the People's Government.
As a result of this reform, products subject to industrial production licensing will be reduced from last year ' s 38-type pressure to the current 24-category.
The Decision makes it clear that there is a simplified approval process for the contents of the catalogue.
One is to change the pre-licensing product test from the pre-licensing product test of the licensing agency to a product certification certificate issued by a qualified inspection body submitted by the enterprise at the time of application.
The second is the introduction of on-site screening of licensed products by the Provincial People ' s Government ' s Quality Technical Supervisory Authority (the Market Supervisory Authority), in addition to hazardous chemicals, whereby enterprises submit applications and product-testing conformity reports with a commitment to ensure the quality of the product, after which they can obtain a production licence after formal qualification, and then undergo on-site examination within a specified period of time.
Three are the different categories of products included in the catalogue of the enterprise's production, which, in accordance with the principle of "one-size-fits-all" and when applying for a new licence or for a change of licence, reviews the issuance of a licence.
"Decision" requires that the relevant departments and agencies in each region firmly advance the work on depressive catalogues and simplified approval procedures.
Increase the commitment of enterprises to publicizing and conducting back-to-back reviews, strengthen credit monitoring and restraint instruments, implement corporate responsibility for quality, and revoke production licences whenever false commitments and non-compliance are required.
For products that are subject to the removal of industrial production licences, there is a need for effective ex post regulation, involving public health and safety, and products such as environmental protection can be converted to mandatory certification, positive listings and social publicity, uniform certification standards, reasonable reduction and certification of testing projects, and mandatory certification costs are, in principle, institutionally borne by all levels of finance.
Support measures to encourage voluntary certification by enterprises, promote branding and market expansion.
To advance the quality of industrial products by adopting advanced international standards.
Make full use of the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality safety of industrial products.
For products that are subject to the maintenance of industrial production licences, the standard system should be improved, industry regulatory advantages should be enhanced, responsibility for "who approves and who controls" should be strengthened, product quality safety risks assessed dynamically, catalogues should be reduced at the appropriate time, approval authority should be delegated or converted to certification management.

According to data released by the National Statistical Office of China on 30 September, China ' s combined PMI output index was 54.1 per cent in September, higher than the previous month ' s and annual averages of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that China ' s enterprises ' productive activities remained generally stable.
In that month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constituted the composite PMI output index, were 53.0 per cent and 54.9 per cent, respectively, a one-litre drop.
Of this, China’s manufacturing PMI is 50.8 per cent, and the ring is 0.5 percentage points down.
According to Zhao Qinghe, the manufacturing industry PMI was characterized by five main features this month:
One is the general stability of manufacturing infrastructure.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, 14 are located in expansionary areas, with pharmaceuticals, specialized equipment, and manufacturing industries such as electrical and mechanical equipment at a higher operating level of 53.5 per cent or more, increasing faster.
Two, small fluctuations in supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0 per cent and 52.0 per cent, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, and supply and demand continued to be stable, but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and the import index were 48.0 per cent and 48.5 per cent, respectively, lower than 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points in the previous month, and the climate was at its lowest point in the year.

On November 5th, Reuters Nagoya - On Monday, the Governor of the Central Bank of Japan, Kuroda, stated that the Central Bank was aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-flexible monetary policy could squeeze the profits of financial institutions and could destabilize the country ' s banking system.
However, he states that given the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Central Bank of Japan needs to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan while paying close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
" The Central Bank of Japan fully recognizes that, under continued monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected, " as he said in his speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He argued that the banking system could be volatile in the event of a serious negative shock if financial institutions were to take risks more actively to compensate for the shrinking profit margins caused by years of low interest rates.
" Although these risks are not significant at present, the central bank will follow the situation closely and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures " , he said.
The minutes of the Central Bank of Japan meeting, published earlier on Monday, showed that the costs of long-term easing policies were rising during the September summit, which was discussed by the Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Japan.
According to the minutes of the meeting, one member stated that " the central bank of Japan will have more policy flexibility in the future if the economy continues to expand ... "
According to the minutes of the meeting, another member said that, given the limits of the duration of the policy, the Committee should discuss how long the central bank of Japan could sustain the stimulus policy ...
According to Dong-hyeon Kuroda, the Central Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks associated with easing policies, while also considering the uncertainty surrounding Japan’s economic prospects, which may affect global demand due to friction in Central American trade and rising protectionism ...
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy has been limited for the time being. "
" But how the problem persists, the impact on the Japanese economy may become greater " , he added.
" There is a need to sustain strong monetary easing policies while considering both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner " , said Toshio Kuroda.
Despite the increase in the ills of radical stimulus programmes, such as long-term low interest rates that erode the profitability of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Central Bank of Japan to maintain the scheme.
The Central Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the war dispute over global trade, Dong-hyin Kuroda ruled out the possibility of a recent increase in interest rates.
June 1, 2018, corporate logo of the Tesla electric vehicle, Cardiff, USA.
Under a settlement agreement, the United States Tesla car and its executive director, Mask, had agreed to pay a fine of $20 million to the financial regulator, and Musk would resign as chairman of the company, but would still be a CEO.
The settlement agreement will end two months of turmoil in Tesla.
The securities fraud settlement agreement disclosed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday would be a relief to investors.
Investors were worried that protracted legal disputes would only further damage the still-deficit electric car company.
SEC sued Mask for fraud on Thursday, claiming that its tweets of 7 August misled investors.
According to the tweets, he was considering privatizing Tesla at $420 per share and obtaining financing.
According to SEC, these tweets are virtually unfounded and the resulting market turmoil harms investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts argue that the agreement may strengthen Tesla, who has been hit hard by the recent actions of Musk.
Steven Heim, the head of Boston Common's asset management, said that the settlement agreement should make Mask more supervised, without taking any "destructive" measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds the battery manufacturer Panasonic shares of Tesla.
According to the proposed agreement, Tesla had to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls over Mask ' s external communications.
" It is in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, that the matter be resolved expeditiously under agreed terms, " as Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The charges on Thursday resulted in the evaporation of a market value of approximately $7 billion for Tesla, which was $45.2 billion on Friday, down from $47.5 billion for general purpose vehicles.
SEC's withdrawal of Mask's claim to be the head of the company in a settlement.
Many investors say this punishment would be catastrophic.
"I think it's the best possible outcome for all concerned, " Ivan Finnseth of Tigress Financial Partners said that Feinseth gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and said that the SEC punishment was a "moderate punishment" for Mask.
"He's still a CEO. It's important to Tesla."
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC charges in the settlement agreement and did not respond immediately to the request for assessment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
The Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Ping) Beijing Morning News journalist learned a day ago from the Beijing Construction Workers Group that one of the core buildings of the Beijing World Park Park Park complex - the Beijing World Park Show Square project will for the first time use a multi-colour ETFE puzzle structure, with 5440 m2 of film structure in deep red, dark green, orange, blue, red, green, six colours, and under the Lasso steel strung line is a butterfly wing.
According to Liu Jiabao, the project leader of the Beijing Builders Five Group, the exhibition square was built in 4,500 square metres, with a total of 1,182 tons of steel installed, the steel-structured housing was supported by a suspension of 26 umbrellas, and the shape of the butterfly wings was displayed under the pull of the Raso steel hanger.
" From the sky, looking down at the show square, it seems as if the colour of the house was wearing flowers, dancing with the colours of the colours, and the colours of the colours will not fade with the passage of time and the frosting of the wind " .
Previously, the monocolour ETFE membrane structure had been widely applied to bird nests, water cubes, etc., but the multicoloured ETFE membrane structure was the first in the country.
Journalists learned that since there are very few suppliers with multiple coloured structures worldwide, each inch of the structure material is " precious " .
Liu Changbao said that, in order to avoid overlaps and "fight" problems, it would also be innovative to use a two-fork ear hangar structure to ensure that the fight beam is in the right place through a special fixed plug.
The construction of the 2019 World Park complex in Beijing is under way.
Among them, the international pavilion has completed all of the parachute suspension works.
It's scheduled to be ready by the end of October.

Secretary-General Xi Jinping gave a very important speech at a private business symposium, instilling firm confidence in the private economy as it moves towards a wider arena.
The Secretary-General of Xi Jinping stressed that "let entrepreneurs take off their minds and move on lightly" created a strong resonance among a wide range of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamism comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, there have been millions of stories of entrepreneurial innovation, and the growth of the entrepreneurial community has constantly driven China ' s economy forward.
For some time now, people in society have spoken out against and suspected of the private economy.
Illustrative claims such as "private economy abstinence" and "new public-private partnerships" have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered difficulties and problems in their development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some exporting firms; rapid adjustment of demand structures has led to pressures for transformation and upgrading; some policies have been uncoordinated, policy effects have overlapped, or the working methods have been simple, leading to the opposite effects of some initially well-intentioned policies.

From further decentralization, the establishment of a power inventory system to the creation of a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a level playing field, and the creation of a society-wide climate of respect for entrepreneurs. In recent years, there has been an unprecedented focus on entrepreneurs in the Party ' s central administration and institutional safeguards.
The symposium was a clear demonstration of policy initiatives in support of six dimensions of private enterprise development, with a series of practical actions dedicated to private enterprise, "Move in Light" .

Inner Mongolia enterprises can declare relevant documents to customs in a paperless manner, avoiding problems such as past field movements, paper applications, repeated submissions, etc.
It is understood that the lead time for document preparation, which refers to the various types of documents required for the import and export chain prior to the declaration, is a major factor affecting the overall clearance time, which must be reduced if customs clearance time is to be reduced and customs clearance costs reduced.

Business users now have direct access to the Single Window portal for online applications.
Once approved by the licensing authority, electronic certificate data are transmitted to customs and automatically compared to customs clearance data at the customs clearance point, smart verifications are conducted, the results are sent to enterprises through a single window, and regulatory document declarations are made, clearances are processed, customs clearances and feedback are processed online on a full-process basis.
The export of Han Xin chicken soup to China has increased 20 times in four years or is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nests - the new Chinese network.
The export of Han Xin chicken soup to China has increased 20 times in four years, and the analysis is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nests.
HAN reported on 5 that last year Korean chicken soup exports to China were more than $100,000, which was about 20 times higher than in 2013 four years ago.
According to the analysis, this increase is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nests in China, which is responsible for facilitating the sale of food, as well as to the increased interest of young people in feeding ...
This data was published on 5th of the Korea Agricultural and Aquatic Food Circulation Society.

According to aT, avian influenza outbreak in Korea between November 2016 and April of last year and a total ban on exports of chicken soup to China by the authorities resulted in a sharp decline in exports.
In 2016, Chinese chicken soup exports to China amounted to $840,000, and exports fell sharply to $100,000 last year due to avian flu.

On the occasion of the celebration of the National Day, a flag-raising ceremony was held at the mouth of the Central Viet Nam border.
" I can't imagine such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony at the border, which is more shocking than watching the flag-raising in the interior ... "
In the morning of 1 January, Mr. Zhang, who traveled from Sichuan to the Yunnan River Port on the border between China and China, together with more than 500 troops and troops, residents and tourists from China and abroad, watched the ceremony to raise the flag of the nation and celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.
The estuary is the largest port in the Yunnan sector of the Central Viet Nam border, located in Yunnan Province, the county of the Red River State, across the river with Viet Nam's old street city, and is a national port.
As the country's "one-way" construction deepens, as one of China's most convenient routes to South-East Asia, the flow of exits and exits at the estuary has increased steadily.

At 7.45 a.m., the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the National Guard at the border checkpoint at the estuary shaky, escorting the flag to the top of the flag with a healthy pace.
After the commanding officer's instructions to raise the flag, the raisers waved out an arc, and the five-star red flag spreads its flag like the eagle's wings, as the national anthem energized the melody slowly rises.

The newly amended personal income tax law adjusts the criteria for determining China's income tax residents from one full year to 183 days.
The Minister of Finance of China, the relevant head of the State Tax Administration, stated on 30th that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside China, including Hong Kong and Macao.

During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released on the Korean peninsula ...
The Korean President recapitulates the DPRK's "irreversible" nuclear abandonment and states that US President Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The United States Department of State subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeyo would visit North Korea in October to facilitate the implementation of the commitments made by the leader of the United States and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea to meet in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present, inter-Korean efforts to break the ice have opened the way to dialogue, inter-Korean and inter-Korean meetings with the leaders of the United States have continued the general trend towards a de-escalation of the situation on the peninsula, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the problems on the peninsula has been upheld.
First, the point that "the essence of the peninsula is security" has not changed. The key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to address the legitimate security concerns of all parties in a balanced manner, rather than to put pressure on each other to emphasize their own claims.
Secondly, in the dialogue to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties were divided on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, and the "who first" game was still strong, owing to the chronic lack of political trust between the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea and the United States.
At the Council ' s previous open meeting on the Korean peninsula, held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties surrounding the issue of sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea once again highlighted these two points of " no change " on the peninsula.
United States Secretary of State Pompeyo insists that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean peninsula is completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, for his part, stressed the principle of "action in response to action", stating: "The trend of weakening sanctions should be the same as the step taken by North Korea on the step-by-step nuclear path " .
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement fully, fully and accurately the resolutions of the Security Council relating to the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, but that pressure is not an end and that the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of the resolutions of the Council, both of which must not be set aside or chosen.
As stated by the Chinese State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi, in view of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and inter-American relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely activation of reversible provisions, thereby encouraging North Korea and the parties concerned to take further steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process require sufficient political courage on all sides ...
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community for a political solution to the question of the peninsula, it is particularly important that the parties show political courage, make political decisions, fulfil their commitments, resolve the difficulties, continue to move forward in parallel with the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula, and work together to create a permanent peace on the peninsula ...
One day the People ' s Government of Kigang County, Pingxi Province, reported that during the National Day, the Yellow River Casket Area, located in the county, would remain at a relatively high water level and would not be open.

At present, the flow of the main yellow river is large, with the flow of the upper river remaining at 2,000 to 3,000 cubic metres per second, the flow of the middle river remaining at 2,500 to 3,500 cubic metres per second, and the flow of the lower river remaining at 3,000 cubic metres per second.
Influenza vaccination services are provided at health centres and health stations, especially on the National Day holiday
The Department of Health has ordered 150,000 doses of a four-priced influenza vaccine for 2018-2019, which is currently available free of charge to high-risk persons, and has provided vaccination services in the health centres and health posts under the Department of Health, especially on the occasion of the national holiday (1 and 2 October) from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
In addition to the above-mentioned measures for the population, the Health Centres and Health Stations under the Department of Health have, since the introduction of the plan, extended the services for influenza vaccination on Mondays to Fridays until 8 p.m., and by 4 p.m. on 30 September, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, more than 3,714 in the same period last year.
Free vaccinations are provided to the following Macao residents: 6 months to 18 years of age, persons aged 50 years and over, pregnant women, all chronically ill persons, including obese persons (i.e. BMI is 30 or more), as well as institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools, staff of secondary schools, all health workers, and residents of Macao who work in gambling fairs.
At the same time, other persons, including the public sector, whom the Board of Health deems necessary to inoculate, will actively contact the relevant agencies to obtain a list and arrange the vaccination at the health centre.
In order to facilitate vaccinations and reduce waiting times, the Department of Health will send health-care personnel between October and December of this year to Benta High School, primary schools, kindergartens and day-care centres, to provide group influenza vaccinations for young children, young and middle-school students, teachers and staff, etc. In addition, the Department of Health will arrange for group vaccinations for the elderly and disabled, for example in public sector and other institutions.

The Department of Health reminded the population that between September 2017 and August 2018, persons who had been vaccinated against the influenza from 2017 to 2018 had yet to be vaccinated against a new flu season since September 2018, as the influenza antigen component of the Northern Hemispheric influenza vaccine from 2018 to 2019 was updated to target seasonal influenza from the winter of 2018 to 2019 and the summer of 2019 in the northern hemisphere.
In Macao, the peak of influenza typically occurs in January-March of each year, later than in temperate regions (e.g., North China and Japan). The Health Department calls on the elderly, children, pregnant women, the obese and chronic patients, among others, to be vaccinated as early as possible from high-risk persons who are more vulnerable to complications following the influenza infection and from those who are in constant contact with high-risk persons.

A 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday in Sulawesi, Indonesia, has now been confirmed dead by over 400 people, many of whom have been swept away by the tsunami caused by the earthquake.

1 October, Tokyo - A quarterly short-view survey published by the Central Bank of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in the September season reached its lowest level in more than a year, owing to rising costs of raw materials and the effects of a series of natural disasters on production, which put pressure on businesses.
This survey hardly shows that the escalating global trade friction is undermining the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-blown trade war is a blow to business prospects and could threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital spending is one of the bright spots in the Japanese economy.
The survey calls into question the view of the Central Bank of Japan that sound economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to the 2% target, despite indications that firms are gradually passing costs on to customers.
" Against the backdrop of concerns raised by the war on global trade, the confidence of manufacturers has stagnated as a result of the slowdown in exports and weak factory production, " the chief researcher at the Golden General Research Institute in Agroforestry, Yuzhmorgeologiya, stated.
"Consumption is still high... and I don ' t think confidence will continue to decline as business profits improve and prices rise... "
Short-view surveys show that in September, the large manufacturing landscape judgement index fell from positive 21 to positive 19 three months ago, worsening for the third consecutive season.
The market estimate is 22%.
In September, the large non-manufacturing weather judgement index fell from a positive 24 to a positive 22 survey in June, with the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey is 22% positive.
Surveys show that the December large manufacturing and non-manufacturing climate judgement indices were stable.
Investors don't care about the decline in the short-term business climate judgement index, which rises on Monday, N 225, to a 27-year high, as the yen continues to depreciate and helps improve the export profitability prospects of Japanese firms.
Capital spending is solid.
Despite the decline in corporate confidence, the latest short view highlights the robustness of business capital expenditure plans, the benefits of renewed capacity, and increased investment in robotics and automation to respond to labour shortages caused by population ageing.
According to a survey by the Central Bank, capital spending by large enterprises for the fiscal year ended March 2019 increased by 13.4 per cent.
The previous short view survey was 13.6 per cent.
Nan Wuzhi said that the capital expenditure plan for all enterprises for the current fiscal year had increased by 8.5 per cent, close to the pace of Japan’s bubble economy.
He stated that " there is room for further growth in capital spending in view of the increase in small-scale enterprises from now on estimated profitability, but much depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence ... "
Short-view surveys showing an increased ability of enterprises to transfer costs, with the large enterprise output price index of positive 7, a decade-long high, are encouraging signs of progress in Japan ' s efforts to combat deflation.
The index for measuring employment in large enterprises, reaching negative 23, is the most compact level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
The second quarter of the Japanese economy rebounded from the contraction of January-March this year, benefiting from strong corporate spending.
But the increased trade friction in the summer and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have overshadowed the prospects of the Japanese economy, which is dependent on exports.
In dollar terms, the rate of increase in services imports and exports is 16.4 per cent.
The Ministry of Commerce website press release quoted the head of the Division of Services and Trade as saying that exports and imports of new and emerging services exceeded $1 trillion in January-August and grew faster than the world at large.
Of this total, new services exports and imports amounted to 1,138,390 million yuan, an increase of 20.9 per cent, higher than the overall rate of 10.4 percentage points for services imports and exports, and boosted the share of new services by almost 3 percentage points.
In the case of services exports, in January-August, services exports continued the rapid growth momentum since this year, with exports growing at a faster rate than imports at 5.7 percentage points.
Of these, the top three areas of growth were telecommunications computers and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, insurance services, which increased by 61.1 per cent, 38.8 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.
The Officer-in-Charge of the Division of Trade and Services also noted that the share of imports of new and emerging services had also been rising in January-August.
In January-August, imports of new and emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6 per cent of imports of services, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Of these, financial services, royalties on intellectual property rights, and imports of telecommunications computers and information services increased by more than 20 per cent, at 47.1 per cent, 23.3 per cent and 23.2 per cent, respectively.

The price of oil, or the "three-for-one" rise, can be filled up early on the Fourth of July.
On September 30th, at 2400 hours, a new version of the price-fixing window will be opened in conjunction with the long holiday at the National Day.
A number of agencies predict that oil prices will increase significantly, and that they will rise by three consecutive times.
The owners of the cars who plan to travel on their own can fill the car with oil before the price rises.
Based on data from crowd-based estimates, it is estimated that the domestic volume of oil produced will increase by about $190 per tonne; and that the price of information generated by Drove will increase by $220 per tonne.
In September, oil prices had already increased twice: on 3 September, petrol had increased by 180 ton and diesel by 170 ton; on 17 September, petrol had increased by 145 ton and diesel by 145 ton.
Domestic oil prices are tied to international oil prices, and international oil prices have risen since the current round of prices, and Brent crude oil has continued to explore after it has crossed the $80 threshold.
As of 28 September, the volume of WTI crude oil futures in the United States had increased by $1.13 to $73.25 per barrel.
Brent's crude oil futures increased by $1.0, at $82.72 per barrel.
" In the light of the international situation, tensions, such as the United States sanctions against Iran, and the overall trend in oil prices, followed by a clear refusal by the OPEC Conference to increase production and give market confidence and steady upward movement in oil prices ... "
According to Drozen's information-finished oil analyst, Xu Wen.
On retail sales, the price of petrol in Beijing currently stands at $7.66 and $8.15 per litre for petroleum in China, 92 and 95, respectively.
According to Li Ying, the information analyst from China, there has not been much change in the marketing strategy of the gas station, where the current preferential margins for the main stations, such as petrochemicals, range from 0.5 to 0.7 per litre to 0.5 to 1.2 per litre for private stations.
"The retail price of this wheel is about to rise `three consecutively ' , and the equivalent price rise is about 0.14-0.16 dollars, suggesting that the owners of private cars should refuel before the long holiday of the Fourth of July. "
School students are subjected to corporal punishment by their teachers for making mistakes.
In response to the incident of "Sooning a pupil who was mistreated by a teacher and was subjected to corporal punishment by a teacher", the official Weibo of the New District Council of Suning City released an information note yesterday stating that it had been found that the teachers of the Suzhou primary school in foreign languages, Lo XX, had been removed from the teacher's post and that the school in question had been disqualified from the annual "senior" qualification.
A recent report from parents that Suning 1st grade 6 girls were beaten at school by class math teachers for making mistakes has raised a lot of concern.
Subsequently, an investigation team was set up by the New District Social Services Department in Suining City to investigate the personnel, ask them, gather evidence from the scene, and remove the teachers involved from their positions.
Yesterday, the official Weibo of the New District Council of Suining City issued an information circular stating that it had been found that RoXX, a teacher at a junior school in foreign languages in Suzhou, had physically punished students.
After research, the End-of-Year Examination of Suzhou Foreign Language Primary School was "No" and the annual "Advanced" was disqualified.
The circular also states that the administrative division of the Suzhou primary schools in foreign languages is subjected to collective recognizance and that the relevant regulations are followed in the case of division and instruction; that the teachers involved are transferred from their posts and taken seriously in accordance with the relevant regulations; and that the schools in the Suzhou primary schools in foreign languages are ordered to carry out in-depth examinations and to carry out teacher-student construction activities and take practical measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.
At the same time, the school has to communicate with the parents on its own initiative and handle the follow-up.
Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany - NCN
The 69th International Astronautical Congress was inaugurated on October 1st at the Bremen Exhibition Centre in Germany by Xinhua Society Bremen, Germany, on October 1st, with the participation of more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and businesses, academics and young students from all over the world.
In his opening address, the President of the International Astronautical Federation, Jean-Yve Legar, said that the global space industry was no longer a mere minority of countries and institutions and that the number of participants had increased significantly this year compared to the previous session, indicating that an increasing number of institutions and individuals were joining.
He called for increased cooperation and innovation to advance the cause of space.
The Vice-Minister of Industry and Informationization of China, Zhang Ke Yiu, Director of the National Space Agency, presented China ' s space programme at the exchange and stated that China would expand international cooperation in space and contribute to the cause of space for mankind.
The participation of representatives of relevant institutions such as the China Space Science and Technology Group, the China Space Science and Technology Group and a number of private enterprises demonstrated the latest achievements in Chinese space, including launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress, which has been held annually since 1950, is the largest event in the world ' s aviation community.
The Congress, which lasted five days, was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Centre for Applied Science and Microgravity Research of Bremen University, the International Institute of Space Law and others.
According to a press release issued by the China Foreign Trade Centre on Sunday, 5 November, Reuters, the Hiroshima meeting showed that China ' s foreign trade situation remained complex and that 80.6 per cent of businesses expected exports to be better than last year or even flat throughout 2018.
However, given domestic raw materials, the rising cost of integrated elements such as labour, and the increased impact of trade friction in China and the United States on the external environment, the participating enterprises consider the export situation to be less promising next year.
At the closing press conference of the 124th ordinary session, the Deputy Secretary-General of the inaugural meeting, the press spokesman, and the Deputy Director of the China Foreign Trade Centre, Xu Jun, said that the number of foreign buyers arriving and the number of exports at the current meeting had fallen by the same amount.
189,812 persons from 215 countries and territories, a decrease of 1.11 per cent.
Exports amount to RMB 2,064,494 million (equivalent to $29,860 million), a decrease of 1 per cent over the same period.
From the market perspective, for Japan, for the 10 ASEAN countries, the BRIC countries, Korea had been able to increase by 74.4 per cent, 11.4 per cent, 7.2 per cent, 2.5 per cent, and for the traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union, respectively, by 30.3 per cent, 8.9 per cent, 7.3 per cent, 0.8 per cent.
In terms of industry, transport, machinery, construction and decoration materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, bathing equipment grew by 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent, and 7.6 per cent, and domestic appliances fell by 13.0 per cent, 6.7 per cent, respectively, in textile clothing.
Xu, as a barometer of China ' s foreign trade and as a sign of wind, data on the participation and exports of the buyers at this meeting show that China ' s foreign trade development will continue to face many uncertainties in the coming year.
However, as structural reforms on the supply side are advanced and as national and local policy measures, such as the "Six Steady" have been introduced recently, the new dynamic of China's foreign trade development is accelerating and new progress is being made in diversifying the enterprise market, which is an important foundation and a strong condition for external trade development.
" Combining the various factors, China ' s foreign trade exports and imports are expected to grow steadily throughout the year, with further improvements in quality and efficiency ... " .
The Chinese Customs Administration announced that exports in United States dollars grew by 14.5 per cent in September, imports by 14.3 per cent in September, trade surpluses of $31,690 billion in September, and export gains and trade surpluses were the highest since February this year.
Although China ' s export performance in September was significantly higher than expected, despite rising trade frictions between China and the United States, with strong external demand and the weakening of the renminbi exchange rate by firms before the United States imposed customs duties, or as a major support factor, showing the resilience of China ' s foreign trade, the Chinese-American trade war has struck confidence and the impact on the industrial chain, and analysts believe that the challenges of China ' s foreign trade may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
According to the Reuters survey, in September, the United States fund manager recommended an increase in cash holdings, maintaining a cautious stance as the United States and China began their latest round of reciprocal import duties and the dispute showed no signs of détente.
However, the 12 fund managers participating in the survey suggested that North America ' s asset allocation had increased to its highest since June 2017, while the euro zone, especially emerging markets, had declined.
Global stock allocation averaged 56.6% and bonds 35.5%, largely consistent with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash distribution ratio rose to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager from a large funder said, " Some economic data bring confidence in the market, but the trade war remains the biggest concern, so it is better to be prepared to enter when the market falls ... "
But in September, the fund manager still favoured equities, especially in the United States, even though they were considered to be high prices.
Today, in China's open landmark, the world's first major national exhibition on the theme of imports — China's International Import Expo — was officially inaugurated in anticipation.
An exhibition is like a window that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through this "window" of the Expo, people see a move towards a higher level of "open China" and the "window" of the Expo, welcome the world to win with the "reform open again" China for mutual benefit.
" For a country, openness is like a flutter of cocoon, which, though painful for a moment, will be replaced by a new life... "
Secretary-General Xi's summing up on the Open Path shows an important reason why China can.
Recalling that 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which has dared to penetrate the world market, has always faced all the risk challenges in an open manner, unleashing its internal energy and increasing its competitiveness, despite its experience of vortexes and waves,
It can be said that China has interpreted the value and meaning of openness strongly with its own solid achievements.
At the beginning of a new history, the organization of an exhibition on the subject of imports was a major decision taken by the Party’s central focus, Comrade Xi Jinping, to promote a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It was a major initiative by China to open its markets to the world. It was a practical move by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization. It demonstrated the strong and clear will that “China’s opening doors will not be closed, but will only grow wider”.
And the "unable to ask" exhibition places are the greatest positive and optimal response to China ' s broader, broader and deeper development of an open economy.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
The build-up of protectionist walls in some countries and the return to the old path of unilateralism have increased the international community ' s concern about the prospects for free trade and added to the uncertainty of a warming world economy.
In the context of these times, this event on the eve of Huang Pu River reflects China ' s defence of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets, shared future Chinese confidence and China to assume its role.
Go on, get out of here.
China ' s open-mindedness and embrace of the world have not only given a powerful boost to its own development, but have also given the world and the region a tremendous "China opportunity " .
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the creation of a " one-way " , initiated the creation of the Asian Investment Bank and set up a Silk Road Fund ... China has provided a range of international public goods, provided a real export market, developed opportunities and jobs, and gave enterprises a ride to China ' s development fast " .
The Expo is also a public product, a platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their distinctive quality products and services.
In addition to national firms, domestic consumers are the real beneficiaries.
By setting up this platform of "optimal excellence", it provides a multi-channel quality supply for consumption upgrading, meeting the individualization of the population, diversity and differentiated consumption needs.
As China opens its doors, the flow of goods and the use of things is made, the steps towards a better life will be firmer.
From a broader perspective, the significance of the Expo goes beyond economics and trade to a vision of the future that conveys openness, inclusion, inclusion, balance, win-win ideas and forges a common understanding to meet today ' s challenges.
The world is better, China is better; China is better.
We look forward to a wonderful and successful event for the world; we look more forward to a better "open China" and a brighter future for the world to work together to build a community of human destinies.
External media: A framework agreement between the United States and the United States on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Summary] The agreement includes Canada ' s opening of its dairy market to the United States and the United States ' temporary non-incurred duty on Canadian-produced cars ...
According to external sources, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of 30 September local time that the United States and Canada had concluded a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was revealed that the agreement included Canada ' s opening of its dairy market to the United States and the United States ' temporary withholding of customs duties on Canadian-produced cars ...
On 27 last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principled agreement to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the 31 August deadline set by the United States to extend the negotiations until 30 September.
Previously, Canada ' s Foreign Minister Freeland ' s spokesperson stated that Canada would only sign a favourable agreement " focused on substance, not timetable ... we will continue our consultations in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in Canada ' s national interest ... "
More than 90% of Brazilian women voters say that presidential candidates do not take women's needs into account.
According to the South American Journal, data published recently by the Brazilian National Institute of Geography (IBGE) show that more than 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not believe that the presidential candidate takes women ' s needs into account.
It is reported that the number of women in Brazil has now reached 107 million and that if Brazilian women are brought together to form a country, the country ' s population will be 13th in the world, twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, where 52 per cent of voters were women and 48 per cent were men, women accounted for only 10 per cent of voters in the Brazilian Congress, although the proportion of women among voters was very high.
Brazil ' s female participation in politics is only 154th out of 193 countries worldwide, higher than in Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have not succeeded in acquiring their rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori points out that this phenomenon is due to the combination of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
" Politics should have been a national ' s claim to citizenship, identity, access to public goods and the formation of multiple social groups in the same society ... But Brazilian politics is a monopoly of a certain group and the majority of the population is not represented ... "
A previous study by the Brazilian Automobile Institute (Locomotiva) also pointed out that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that elected politicians could represent their rights, 90 per cent did not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93 per cent did not agree with the current government policy on governance.
"We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in Parliament, and the Brazilian political system continues to be affected by inequality ... So far, there is still a serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the Brazilian political sphere ... " Natalia Mori says ...
Despite the lack of women ' s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
According to the survey, 76 per cent of women believed that they could make a difference in democratic elections and 72 per cent were interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democracy is the best way to make women less prejudiced.
On October 1st, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony to welcome the 69th birthday of the new China.
The event was attended by more than 80 representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, news agencies in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese-owned enterprises, overseas Chinese nationals, Confucius College and student students.
On 1 October, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to greet the 69th birthday of the New China.
After the flag-raising ceremony, the Chinese Ambassador to Ha Zhang Xiao said that it was a profound patriotic educational activity to hold a flag-raising ceremony in other countries on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great motherland.
You've lived abroad for a long time, but you're always a great country.
Zhang Jing said that the Chinese people are today closer than ever to the great goal of achieving national renaissance and to the centre of the world stage.
" Our mission, our responsibilities and our work are more honourable, arduous and onerous than ever before... "
Zhang Xiang stressed the need to keep in mind his mission, to promote the construction of the "one way" by the Chinese and the Chinese Communist Party, to take a steady step forward, to draw a more beautiful "one-way " by the "one-way " by the other, and to devote all his energy to the development of the country.
The T2 terminal was inaugurated on the 30th day of Guangxi Guilin International Airport.
According to Zhao Le Qin, Secretary of the Central Chinese Communist Party, the opening of the new terminal will meet the demand for 12 million passengers a year and will create a new advantage in the air traffic of Gui Lin. It will be of great importance to further improve the connection between the Guangxi River, the sea and iron, the surface and the sea.
Kiirin is expecting 90 million visitors this year.
The expansion of the T2 terminal and the stairwelling facilities at Guilin International Airport is a major public service project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Gang Autonomous Region and a landmark project for the construction of the Guilin International Tourist resort.
The project began in December 2015 with a construction area of 100,000 square metres, with a total investment of RMB 3.258 billion, which will allow for 12 million annual passenger throughputs, 10.12 million landings and 95,000 tons of mail throughput.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal at Gjilin International Airport.
The design of the new terminal is inspired by the waters of Guilin Hills, and it looks like a mountain crown, close to the "Ring Ridge Trailing Field" and the roofs of the Quibei People's Landing, where the waters of Guilin Hill are conjoined.
It was reported that the new terminal at Guilin airport could accommodate a peak flow of nearly 4,000 arrivals and exits per hour, using smart baggage sorting systems, security integration platforms, human face recognition and other "intellectual empty ports" techniques, and planning commercial zones covering a wide range of trades, such as catering, department stores, tax exemptions and leisure.
Because growth in Asia and emerging markets is largely not encouraging in Europe, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container ship docked in a port in New Jersey, United States.
But because the current growth in the United States has benefited from the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the economy has also received close attention from the outside world.
"As the United States is returning to full employment, the economic downturn is inevitable... "
He says the only question is when it's gonna happen, and in his opinion, it's probably just not going back.
Despite Barclay's optimism about the United States economic outlook by the end of the year, the bank acknowledged that it was more difficult to predict further time.
" In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth, the current growth stimulated by fiscal policy will not be sustainable " , a study by Barclays Economist said.
" At a time of lack of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing of the economy in 2020 will rise " , they said.
A series of business surveys will show in general terms that major economies are at the stage of the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and United States Manufacturing Survey, scheduled for Monday, will receive attention and the services survey will be published on Wednesday.
But next week's data will certainly focus on the non-farm employment data for the United States, which will be published next Friday, and will provide clues as to whether the tight employment market is driving wage growth.
Its importance, not only because of its importance to the profitability of the business and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because of salary hikes or overall inflation increases, may be a source of concern for officials of the United States Federal Reserve.
"The pay will be of great concern, as the ring may have risen again from the previous month.
September may not have gone up by 3% over the same period the previous year, but we can well expect a breakthrough next month, " The Netherlands International Group (ING) economist wrote in a study ...
European politics may become a source of market volatility at a time when vacations in China and other parts of Asia have led to a bleak data profile for the region next week.
The Italian Government ignores its previous financial commitments to the EU, and the other EU member States will have to quickly determine whether or not to reject Italy's decision strongly. Tria does not support the decision, and he hopes to comply with EU rules.
The annual meeting of the British Conservative Party in Birmingham may also be sparkling as the British retreat talks enter a critical phase.
Meanwhile, concerns surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to diminish as Brazil holds the hoped-for presidential elections next weekend.
[Summary] The ship, when completed, will be placed at the disposal of the East China Sea Division of the National Oceanic Administration of China, and Chen Xiao, Chief of the Observation Service of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, stated that the vessel was operational and would be of great importance for the development of the China Offshore Ocean Observing System and for the promotion of global ocean observations.
On September 29, China's first 3000-ton large-scale buoy ship, the "Girl 22" ship, was in the water of the China Warships Group.
The ship, when completed, will break the current equipment bottlenecks in China in large buoys, submarine placement, recycling, repair and so forth.
The "Girl 22" wheels are used mainly for regular buoy/submarine cruise maintenance, regular placement, recycling, emergency buoy/submarine placement, recovery, recovery, recovery, repair, etc., with the capacity to carry out integrated marine survey missions, such as gap surveys.
The new ship is 89 meters long, 18 meters wide, 7.2 meters deep, and continues at 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Xiao, Deputy General Manager of the Wusheng Group, stated that " [t]his 22 ships are the first large buoy operating vessel in the country and the only one in the country with 10 metres capacity to operate a large buoy, will further enhance our large buoy security capability ... " .
It is understood that the ship, once completed, will be placed at the disposal of the East China Sea Division of the National Oceanic Administration of China, and Chen Xiao, Chief of the Observation Service of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, stated that the vessel will be operational and will be of great importance for the development of the China Offshore Ocean Observing System and for the promotion of global ocean observations.
" The vessel is simultaneously equipped with large buoy placement maintenance operations, combined with an integrated maritime survey capability, and is our first integrated vessel dedicated to mid- and long-sea buoy operations and integrated ocean survey operations.
With such a buoy ship, our ocean observation and ocean survey will now have a powerful sharp instrument ... " .
On October 1st, China's Qingjia electricity was affected by typhoon "Pangmi", the first race was postponed to October 1st at the Tsai Qingjia Cup, the international maximum sailship series scheduled to open on September 30th, and a pre-game meeting was held at the Qingjia Osten Center, where the captains of 12 water-wing double-hull fleets from six countries and territories were present.
Under the influence of the typhoon "Bummy" and the strong winds in the pool, the maximum speed of which is 24 knots, the signal has been delayed for nearly 90 minutes from 1 p.m. 30 p.m., the wind has not decreased, and the competition is postponed until the afternoon of 1 October, when Anne Mdrand, the Managing Director of the competition, announced the cancellation of the first day of the competition.
"The wind from the shore continues, and the sea is so intense... "
Mdrand explains: " In this case, no one knows when the wind will strike the ship. "
The race near the city, in the present state of affairs, is the wisest option ... "
All ready crews are still a little disappointed.
"The ship is ready to stop, and we're in good shape."
Max Richardson, the Qingjia rudder, said: " But I know it's the right choice to change the game, and I hope the wind will be smaller today, and we can do it all at once... "
Omika Wilkinson, known as the New Zealand team for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said, "The loss of a day makes the game more interesting.
Because today's game's gonna be worth more, and it's only got two days left.
We're all going to have to work so hard. "
Despite the sea winds, the French ABM rudder Pierre Ives Durand, who met before the race, appealed for his warmth with the race in the Tianan Island: five years ago, the international limit sails series had their own injuries, broken muscles, and thanks to the handling of the local race medical team, they were able to stand on the field today, five years later.
According to the information received, the International Expeditions Series was launched in 2007 as a world sail league with Volvo, the American Cup, the World sailboats against the Tours and so forth.
The Aoshima Station competition will use the Flying Phantom.
The year 2018 was the eighth year of the race to land on Qingdao Island, and Qingdao Station was also in the series.
Despite the worldwide financial market shocks, the Hong Kong Financial Authority reported on Monday that foreign exchange fund investment revenues fell significantly by 97 per cent in the third quarter of this year, but were better than in the previous quarter, as overseas shares rose and foreign exchange losses narrowed significantly during the China-United States trade war.
According to the most recent data of the Monetary Authority, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$ 1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which is significantly lower than HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
The President of the King's Administration, Chen Deok-hyun, stated in the Legislative Assembly that at the beginning of the China-United States trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indices ran counter to the United States stock index and that until late September, when the United States stock market index peaked in early October, market sentiment began to reverse, as investors became aware of the adverse effects of the trade war on the United States itself.
" A change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if the trade war has only a one-sided impact, it won ' t help to solve things... "
At the same time, he pointed out that " financial market volatility will continue to rise if the US-China trade war is not resolved ... "
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund ' s share investment deficit in Hong Kong was between 8 and 4.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (K$) compared to the previous quarter, while the return on overseas stock investment was between 172 and 12.8 billion HK$; the foreign exchange loss was between HK$ 16.2 billion and the bond income of HK$ 9.7 billion, a decrease of 24 and 31 per cent, respectively, per quarter, reflecting, inter alia, the general rise in the dollar against major currencies during the season and the rise in the United States rate of fruits by 3 points in mid-September.
Foreign exchange funds are used mainly to support Hong Kong Dollars.
The Hong Kong dollar-to-dollar linked exchange rate system has been in place since 1983.
With regard to the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Deok-hyun stated that while economic and asset market uncertainty and downside risks have increased, Hong Kong ' s financial system is robust and resilient.
" Hong Kong has a strong international investment position, with a net external asset value of $1.4 trillion equal to four times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore and 0.6 times higher than Japan, with enough to cope with a downward or reversal of the economy ... "
In recent years, Hong Kong dollar dismantling has continued to fall and has increased its dollar spread. Chen Deok-kyung noted that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate had risen by more than 400 basis points on 21 September, and that the market is generally believed to be related mainly to the increase in the Hong Kong dollar, followed by the United States dollar pegling around 7.80-7.84, and the recent decline in the Hong Kong dollar recovery, which has increased the margin with the United States dollar, is likely to attract the market to the Hong Kong dollar and to increase interest-saling activities in the United States dollar, thus giving Hong Kong dollars a greater chance of triggering weaker exchange guarantees again than in the previous period.
However, he believes that with the start of the Hong Kong Bank interest increase cycle, Hong Kong dollar interest rates will be normalized and future Hong Kong dollar interest rates below the dollar will change.
" Hong Kong dollar interest rates will be more consistent with the trend of dollar interest rates, and there is a need to be more careful in managing risks and preparing for market fluctuations... "
As a result of the availability of HK$, Hong Kong dollar interest payments have fallen further, from 0.9 to 2.08179 per cent on the first day of the three-month break-up week, the difference between the 46 basis points and the US dollar has been extended from 51 basis points to the five-month low, and the difference between the 120 basis points and the US dollar has been expanded from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate for most of the time was close to 7.85 to $1.
During this period, the transfer of funds from the stock exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August, after the first time in April, as a result of the hedging activity and the partial withdrawal of funds from the Hong Kong dollar after the completion of the large equity campaign.
The Hong Kong dollar was purchased at 7.85 in accordance with the associated exchange rate system, and the US dollar was sold to maintain stability in the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
In May and August, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority purchased approximately HK$52.1 billion under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Does the new tax law offer advantages to persons outside the country?
In response to a 30-day question from a journalist, the relevant head of the Department of Revenue stated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider the continuation of preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Macao.
A journalist asked that the newly revised personal income tax law adjusts the rate for taxpayers of our individual income tax residents from one full year to 183 days.
Are there any preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Atota, in the next step in the implementation of the Act?
In response, the Officer-in-Charge stated that the implementing regulations of the current personal income tax law provide for special benefits for the payment of taxes to persons outside China. Individuals who do not have residence in China but who have resided for more than one year or more than five years may pay personal income tax only in respect of part of the income paid by the unit or individual in China.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new Personal Income Tax Act would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside Hong Kong, including Hong Kong Atota.
There's no "threshold" center: Quality certification leads to quality improvement.
With the economy of the two children, the mother and child market boomed from the north up to the three or four-line cities, there were various classes of moons.
The popular demand for consumption was met by the very hot Moon Club, with fees ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, but at the same time in an awkward position, an institution that so far had no threshold and there were gaps in supervision.
A series of national "Quality Months" in 2018, conducted by the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, has recently brought journalists to a five-star moon centre in Tianjin City to visit a certified experience of mother and child care services.
General month centres provide services such as neonatal care, feeding, postnatal rehabilitation and plastics.
In this month's centre, journalists see that nurses check the breastfeeding of newborns on a daily basis, and professional nurses provide such fine care as bathing and caressing for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the new mother, services such as early care for the wounds of the first and later months of the month, nursing programmes such as Chinese medicine and beauty treatment, and helping the mothers to recover their positions.
One of the new mothers at the house told the reporter that she was only eight months ahead of schedule.
The services of the Moon House have a direct impact on the comfort and physical recovery of the mother during the period of her monthly child, and some of the small Moon Clubs can only provide simple monthly services, with sterilized hygiene irregularities, vulnerability to cross-infection, a single unscientific diet, etc.
The head of the Moonsuke Center said they were the only one in all the five-star Moons Centers in Tianjin City who had been certified as a B-class service.
" Although some clients did not initially understand the meaning of B-level certification, it was important for the long-term development of an enterprise to benefit from rigorous standardized process management through certification " , he said.
The Deputy Director-General of the Department of Accreditation and Supervision of the National Directorate-General of Market Supervision, Phen Livin, said that certification of services was based on customer perception and that a new certification system focusing on organizational quality management and the satisfaction of service characteristics was an important component of the country ' s quality infrastructure and had a positive role in increasing the share of quality service provision and enhancing the international competitiveness of China ' s services.
Since 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone a process of gradual development, with a number of influential services such as financial service certification, certification of mother and child care services, certification of commodity after-sales services, certification of e-commerce services, certification of health services, etc.
According to the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, there are currently more than 130 service certification bodies, more than 2,000 service certification officers and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates in the country.
Panliffe expressed the need to further guide and promote the development of service certification by gradually expanding service certification coverage in areas such as health, education, sports, finance, electricity suppliers and facilitating service supply side reform and quality improvement.
Reuter Hong Kong, 5 November - Hong Kong Building prices fell for two consecutive months after the top, and Chen Deok-hyun, President of the Hong Kong Financial Authority, stated on Monday that it would take time to see whether the city had entered the down-cycle, and if confirmed, to consider a policy of easing counter-cyclical measures at the appropriate time.
Chen Deok-hyun added that if the price of the building were to turn back, the first people to be affected would be those who would be in business at the peak of the city, but it was expected that the price of the building, as in the case of the Asian financial storm of 1997, would fall sharply and that the chances for citizens to sell their property would be much lower.
Chen Deok-hyun, who led several senior members of the Kim Bureau to the Legislative Council briefing, said that if it was confirmed that the city was entering a downward cycle, it could relax at the appropriate time.
"But it's a matter of weeks of data, and it's still too early to relax. It's still gonna take a little more time to see if the city's going down.... "
Since October 2009, the Monetary Authority has introduced eight rounds of countercyclical measures to boost bank risk management and earthquake resilience by significantly tightening mortgages in all categories of property, including by reducing the number of mortgages, requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests, etc.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest-raising cycle, the price index for private residential buildings in Hong Kong fell for two months in August-September, and the monthly decline in September increased to 1.44 per cent.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of the year was 10.2%.
According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the financial situation of households measuring their resilience to financial risks remains healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households without mortgages in Hong Kong reached 66 per cent, up from an average of 60 per cent in 2009-11; the average number of new mortgages was 47 per cent and the ratio of new mortgages to revenue was 34 per cent, a marked improvement from 64 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, in 2009-11.
Chen Deok-hyun said, however, that high seismic resistance does not mean that the economy will not be damaged by the downside because property valuations will fall and those who buy buildings at the peak will be the first to suffer.
Although the Authority tightens bank lending to mortgage lenders, mortgage lenders can also obtain high-value mortgage lending through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans from developers.
Chen Deok-yung indicated that at present, together with mortgage lending to developers, borrowers can pay 85-90 per cent of mortgages, and that if building prices drop by 10 per cent, negative assets (i.e. property market value drops below the level of total outstanding mortgage loans) will emerge.
However, the Vice-President of the Monetary Authority, Nguyen Guoh-hung, noted that the authorities estimated that the total amount of mortgages provided by developers was only 2 - 2.5 per cent of the total amount of bank mortgages, which was still low.
At the peak of Hong Kong ' s negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, representing 22 per cent of the supply population.
And as of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets in seven consecutive seasons.
Xinhua's retail e-commerce export business in Beijing on October 1 (Lu Hongxia, Mawe) has received another wave of tax benefits on October 1 in terms of value added tax (VAT), consumer tax exemption, etc.
The Ministry of Finance, the National Directorate of Taxation, the Ministry of Commerce, and the General Customs Department have previously issued a joint communication specifying that the following conditions are to be applied to the export of goods for which no valid import certificate has been obtained by electric power exporters in the integrated cross-border e-commerce pilot zone, and to the implementation of a tax exemption policy on consumer taxes.
First, e-commerce export enterprises are registered in the comprehensive testing area and are registered on the integrated services platform on the cross-border e-commerce line of the place of registration, the date of export, the name of the goods, the unit of measure, the quantity, the unit price, the amount.
Second, export of goods is subject to electronic commerce export declarations through the customs service of the site of the Comprehensive Test Zone.
Third, the export goods are not those that are not subject to a decision by the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Administration to explicitly cancel export refunds (exemption) from taxes, in accordance with the decision of the State Council ...
The circular specifies that the General Customs Service regularly transmits electronic information on the electronic commerce export declaration list to the National Tax Administration.
The tax authorities of the CYPs strengthen the tax-free management of export goods on the basis of electronic information from the Export Goods Declaration List, which is cleared by the State Tax Administration.
The circular states that specific tax exemptions are administered by the provincial tax administrations in the form of commercial finance and the commercial sector.
The leadership teams and business authorities in the integrated pilot zones should coordinate and promote inter-sectoral collaboration and policy implementation, accelerate the establishment of a system for monitoring e-commerce export statistics and promote the rapid development of cross-border e-commerce.
On November 5, a man in Liaoning province killed his lover and dumped his body, and then fled to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On 5 May, the journalist learned from the East Victory Public Security Bureau of the city of Ordos in Inner Mongolia that the man had been successfully captured following a joint police investigation between the two regions.
On 26 June 2018, a female disappeared in the city of Saddle Mountain, Liaoning province, and her family called the local police.
As a result of a police investigation, this is not a simple case of missing persons, who are at high risk of being killed by a lover, and the police set up a special unit to investigate further.
On October 30, the task force found out that the suspect Wang may have been hiding in the East Victory District of Ordos and that the police immediately organized a strong police force to cooperate fully with Liaoning's police in order to solve the case.
After five days of investigation, the civilian police finally figured out where Wang was and detailed their contacts.
On November 4th, the two police forces joined forces to capture the suspect, Wang, at an excavator's fittings shop in East Victory.
According to Wang, he had a relationship with the victim's lover, and because White's sister had a large sum of money held in her name, they decided to take it for themselves.
On June 22, 2018, when Wang and Paik disagreed over the disposition of the money, Wang went on to kill White in the rental house and toss the body.
At the moment, the suspect Wang has been handed over to the Liaoning Hill Police.
"Five Great Developments, Good Emblems, Green Development in Action"
The second column of the theme "Five Developments, Better Emblems" - "Green Development in Action" train was officially launched on 5th.
In order to give a full picture of the brilliant work of the Five Great Developments and the Better Emblem, the All-Old City Orbital Corporation and the Golden Pilgrim Media Technology Corporation designed the series of five Developments and Better Emblems.
Among them, the first train -- the "Innovation in Action" -- was officially launched on 1 October on Track 1 in Homogene City.
The theme train on the line picked the blue green modulus that symbolized mountain water, reflecting birth machines, vitality and purity.
The campaign focused on the concept of the five pillars of development and the 18 representative examples of green development outcomes in the province, including the Jianghua Canal Project, the Long Forest System, the conservation of the Yangtze Economic Zone and the construction of green development priorities such as the Ten Million Acre Forest Growth Project.
In addition, the "Coordination of development in action " , " Open development in action " , and the "Shared development in action" thematic train will be on the line in the near future.
On October 1, the first day of the Golden Week in the Mainland, and the last day of the Hong Kong National Day public holiday, many residents of the Mainland used the holidays to travel abroad, shopping, and many Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong on that day, and there was a flow of "blowers" at the Shenzhen ports, Lake Lo and Shenzhen Bay ports, opening 22 new self-help channels to improve port clearance efficiency and facilitate efficient and expeditious clearance of passengers.
According to data from the Shenzhen General Inspectorate, at 1600 hours the same day there were more than 429,000 departures and departures from the Shenzhen port, more than 168,000 vehicles (one, rack, rows), and the ports remained busy and maintained a good order of entry and exit.
It is understood that the number of tourists taking advantage of national holidays to go on holiday shopping in countries such as Europe and South-East Asia continues to increase, due to a number of positive factors, including the increase in the number of countries offering exit and exemption policies to Chinese citizens.
In the early morning hours of 1 January, the entrance of the port of Lo, Lake Shenzhen Bay, Wang Kong, Fukuda and others reached a peak of passenger flows, which lasted from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., and the Shenzhen crossing from 6.30 a.m. to 13:00 a.m.
It was reported that, in response to the peak flow of incoming and outgoing passengers (cars), the Shenzhen border General Inspectorate station was deployed in accordance with the National Immigration Administration in an integrated manner, initiating the passenger (car) peak hour service model, arranging overtime police to support the first line of duty, opening advance foot-checking routes, directing passengers, conducting orderly vehicle pre-screening, ensuring that Chinese citizens ' entry and exit customs clearance queues do not exceed 30 minutes, taking into account the efficiency of customs clearance for foreigners; and strengthening the maintenance of order in high-flow areas and ensuring the safe and orderly passage of customs.
At the Shenzhen border control station, at the same time, travellers are reminded of their identity papers and visas, the validity of their notes, the reasonable scheduling of their travels, the best possible time to avoid peak flow periods, the right time to choose and the right time to travel at the port.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong by high speed train in Hiroshima must have valid entry/exit documents and a visa sign, such that a ticket is only by car and cannot be used as an entry/exit document, and if they are unable to leave Hong Kong due to, inter alia, non-compliance with documentation, they must follow the guidelines of the Border Guard and wait to be taken to a designated location by the staff of the Hong Kong Railway Company to facilitate their return to the Mainland.
Systemic red filamental ailment is a chronic syndrome of tired and dirty instruments that were once considered " incurable " .
The lack of effective treatment prevents treatment because of the lack of clear mechanisms for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the Life Sciences College at Qinghua University, and Chewie Tsumi, Director of the Rheumatological Immunization Centre at the Beijing University Hospital, jointly found that there were molecular mutations in human immune protein that increased systemic red filamental susceptibility and that were involved in managing immune B cells.
In short, both teams have confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is a major cause of systemic haemorrhagic disease.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaojun of the North Great People ' s Hospital, the Chestnut Nation team collected and studied nearly 2,000 cases of systematic haemorrhagic haemorrhagic ailments and found that the incidence and severity of infectious diseases such as immunoglobin mutation had increased significantly in patients with a large number of antibodies, kidneys, arthritis, mammothitis, blood vessels, etc.
The Liu Wanli team, through various research methods, such as immunocytes, animal experiments, sequencing, found this immune signal activated by immuno-molecular mutation, and promoted disease-prone mechanisms in B-cell partitioning of multiple self-resistances.
Journalists have learned that the two teams are strongly united, taking full advantage of their respective strengths and bringing together basic research and clinical applications.
The Liu Wanli team is dedicated to Blymphocyte immunisation, immunoactivity research, and the Chestnut Nation team is engaged in long-term clinical research on systematic red coronary ailments.
" This study is one of the results of years of collaboration between the two teams, and it is the first time that the academic community has institutionally recognized that immunoglobin genetic abnormalities will induce systemic haemorrhagic ailments and provide a solid basis for further academic research and clinical targeting for treatment ... "
It's not a bailout, it's a law.
A lawyer with an axe sitting in court?
The news was really exciting at first, and it blew up in the law circles.
The Fujian Quan City Central Law subsequently fined the lawyers involved $500 and advised in writing that the Quan Quan City Bar Association should conduct an investigation.
According to the Newjing newspaper, the City Council of Quan County issued an official circular stating that the two lawyers ' actions did not involve violations of the law and were not punishable under the law.
According to multiple reports, the Quanzhou City Bar is not dealing with short-term protection or confrontation, but with the approval of the Quanzhou Middle Court.
An incident that could have caused tension within the legal community was finally resolved.
The reversal stems from a more complete return to the truth: the axe carried by the lawyer in question is identical to the murder weapon of the defendant, the same type, but unopened, supporting evidence only at the evidentiary level, with no intimidation or subjective intent to "imperil the safety of the court".
There are four very important details to determine whether the lawyer ' s conduct is in violation of the law: first, the local court held two previous sessions, with only an ax photo showing, which, from the point of view of the defence, was necessary; second, the ax was purchased only an hour before the opening of the trial, not because the lawyer was unwilling to seek the judge ' s consent, but objectively failed to reach the judge; third, the entire ax was not overstretched or improperly used; and fourth, the lawyer in question publicly acknowledged the error at the first time and expressed his apologies to the court.
Combining these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer in question has nothing to do with bringing the axe to court, just to defend himself.
After clearing up the whole story, the Quanzhou City Council did not go to work, but took an unpunishable decision in response to the pressure.
And this decision can stand the test of fact and law.
The fact that an axe is brought to the court as a control knife without the court ' s permission is a real source of anxiety and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, previous fines and judicial advice from the Quanzhou Middle School are no exception.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making lawyers difficult, the Supreme Law issued the " Rules for the Security Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People ' s Courts " in 2014, which establishes the principle that lawyers are not required to carry out physical security checks when appearing before the courts.
Since the rule was issued, a wide range of lawyers have led by example, and few incidents have occurred that endanger the safety of the Tribunal as a result of security breaches.
In very isolated cases like Quanzhou, it is easy to dispel misunderstandings as long as they are communicated in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulating organization in the legal profession, has a dual mandate of punishing wrongful acts and safeguarding legality.
In the past, IAJOs suffered from severe illness due to their bias towards discipline, lack of security.
And the decision of the Quinzhou Bar, both in terms of process and outcome, is commendable, setting an example for more members of the Bar to perform their duties properly.
From October 1st, which tax revenues will affect our money bags?
The Xinhua Society ' s new personal income tax law of 1 October 2010 in Shanghai (journalist Samdang) will be implemented as of 1 January 2019. In order for the public to benefit from the tax bonus as soon as possible, the tax proceeds actually earned by taxpayers will be deducted from 1 October at the starting point of $5,000 per month and a new tax scale will be applied.
What exactly are the benefits of a new deal that would affect the population?
Good one: significant tax deductions from salary payments
Taxpayers who receive wages after 1 October may deduct the basic deduction of $5,000/month and apply the new tax scale. Most taxpayers have different degrees of tax deductions, especially for low- and middle-income persons.
According to the table on tax deductions for different income groups, the monthly amount of income after deduction of the Triad is $8,000, $10,000, $50,000. The tax adjustment is taxable in the amount of $90, $290, $1590, $9090, or 73.9 per cent, 61.1 per cent, 49.0 per cent and 18.8 per cent, respectively, as compared with the start-up fee of $3500.
It is worth noting that, due to holidays, the salaries that were due by law in October at the end of September are subject to a new basic scale of deductions and tax rates.
To this end, the collection client software, which the tax authorities have consistently promoted, has provided the corresponding tax calculation functionality, but the corresponding tax is still subject to a declaration of payment within the statutory filing period.
Good two: the low tax grade is significantly larger.
In addition to raising the point of origin, a new scale will apply as of 1 October.
For the current salary, the seven-stage tax on salaries has remained the same as before, but there has been a marked change in the tariff range, with 3 per cent, 10 per cent, a significant increase in the 20 per cent three-stage low tax range, and a reduction in the 25 per cent tax range, while 30 per cent, 35 per cent, and 45 per cent of the three higher rates.
It is worth noting that the tax code also adjusts the tax rates earned by production operations, with the threshold of 35 per cent of the ceiling being raised from $100,000 to $500,000.
This means that individual business owners, individual sole proprietorships will benefit from tax changes.
" In the light of the previous tax reduction measures for individual taxpayers in Shanghai, the dividends of a tax reform will be fully felt by a wide range of taxpayers, especially among low- and middle-income groups ... "
The head of the personal income tax division of the Shanghai Municipal Revenue Department of the National Revenue Authority, Ramin, said...
Three benefits: tax services are easier and better optimized
Since the promulgation of the new Personal Income Tax Act, the tax authorities of Shanghai have carried out a series of comprehensive and extensive tax campaigns.
On the one hand, policy advice on "one-on-one, point-on-point" for priority tax sources.
The Pudong New District Revenue Authority has visited Apple Trading (Shanghai) Ltd., pay-for-sweet (China) Network Technology Ltd., and large enterprises such as Red Star's Mei Kailong Family Group Ltd., which have a large number of employees, large surrogate payments, large tax payments, voluntary mentoring by the tax authorities, questions and answers; the Xu Hing District Revenue Authority has visited the Small and Medium Financial Consulting Company of the large labour enterprises in the region, the China-China-Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Corporation, etc., to collect business concerns, respond to business demands and resolve business difficulties in a timely manner.
On the other hand, a tax policy of "all dimensions, multiple dimensions, stereotypic" was introduced to a large number of taxpayers.
Use the Shanghai official tax website, Twitter and other channels to deliver policy hot spots in a timely manner to ensure that policy advocacy is in place.
At the same time, on September 28th, the Shanghai Tax Micro-Treats Public Intelligent Counselling Platform 12366 launched a "Target-to-Intelligent" Smart Integrated Tax Reform Advocacy Service through the "Ambassy-to-Intelligent" Tax Service.
On the evening of Beijing 4 p.m. on November 5th, China-News Network officially announced that the former English captain, Rooney, would return to England and fight for the United States team on November 15th.
Last August, Rooney announced his withdrawal from England.
Rooney was the first shot in the history of the team and the second in the history of the team.
According to information released by the Network, this game with the United States team was to raise funds for the Runi Children ' s Charity Foundation, and Rooney himself was very excited: " It's a pleasure to represent England again in Wimbley, thanking Sosgate and the United States Chief of Staff for inviting me to help my foundation. "
It's the greatest honor of my career in England, and the 120th time it will be my last time in England, and for me it will be a special memory... "

Crab shells, crab feet, crabs, crabs, and food eaters feel the beauty of being in the south of the river.
Crab Farm Kim Wei tells us that more people will spend more time in Ba'al this year, by the silhouette lake, by watching the white aphids, by the sunset, by having fun catching crabs, by enjoying a slow pace of water.
Because of the widespread introduction of large-scale seedlings in the town of Ba, this year's big gate crabs are bigger than ever before.

A tripartite trade deal between the United States and Mexico will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
According to external media reports, a joint statement of Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and United States Trade Representative Letheser, published on the Canadian Government ' s website, states that the United States, Canada and Mexico have entered into a tripartite trade agreement that will be known as " USMCA " .
Prior to this, CTV News Canada quoted senior American sources as saying that Canada and the United States had resolved their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post quotes two knowledgeable sources who reported that the agreement reached on 30 September between the United States and Canada would retain NAFTA as a tripartite trade agreement and that the three heads of State would sign a new agreement within two months.
The statement stated: " Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement - the USMCA - which will provide our workers, farmers and companies with a high standard of trade agreement that will lead to freer markets, fairer transactions and more sustainable economic growth ... The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create high-paid jobs and create new opportunities for some 500 million people ... "
According to the information received, the existing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in 1994 by the United States, Mexico and Canada.
When Trump took office, he announced plans to reconsider the agreement and sign a new agreement.
The three countries started the negotiation process in 2017.
On the morning of the first morning of local time, the Okinawa Supervisory Council election, which was held in advance because of the death of the former Governor of Japan, announced the successful election of Danny Yuzhmorgeologiya, who was opposed to the relocation of the United States military base in Japan.
The results of the vote cast on 30 September show that Tam City won 396,632 thousand votes, the highest in the history of the Okinawa Governor's election, and more than 80,000 votes were cast than the main contestant, Sasaki Sun.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24 per cent, which is 0.89 percentage points lower than the 2014 Okinawa Prefectural Election.
On 1 January, Tam City told the press that the results of the election showed that the people of the county did not want to let the Governor's efforts to survive waste, that he would continue to work with the Japanese and American governments against the relocation plan of the US military bases and the closure of the Panchaun bases.
U.S. military base is located in Ieno Bay, Okinawa County, and has been plagued by disease. The Japanese and American government had previously agreed to relocate it to the border areas of the city, but the people of Okinawa were strongly opposed to its complete removal from Okinawa.
With regard to the relocation plan, which was strongly opposed by the villagers, and the withdrawal of the land-filling permit on the coast of Kono, Yuzheng stated that he had not taken a stand against and divided with the central Government at the outset, and hoped that the two sides would have a full exchange of views that would demonstrate their intention to reach a negotiated settlement.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also expressed to the media in the morning that he would take this outcome seriously and would work on revitalizing Okinawa and reducing the burden on the base.
At a press conference on 1 January, Japanese officer Yu Yi Wei said that there had been no change in the government's approach to moving US military bases as soon as possible.
He also expressed his desire to talk to Yuzheng.
Jade City will be inaugurated as Okinawa County Governor on 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, United States, has grown more soybeans in his land as China's demand for oil seeds has grown.
This shift reached its peak this year, with 1,600 acres of soybeans planted in 5,000 acres, the size of which has never been seen before.
But Thomas and a lot of farmers like him plan to switch in 2019 to the former American agricultural areas of staple food crops: corn and wheat.
American farmers have grown more soybeans this year than corn, for the first time in 35 years.
The reason for planning to switch to other food crops is because American farmers are facing difficulties in selling soybeans against the backdrop of US President Trump's trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of United States soybean exports, but in recent months almost zero United States soybean purchases have dropped soybean prices to a decade low as a result of the trade war.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that depend on China for demand.
Thomas says the soybean price "has hit us hard."
He states that, without Chinese purchases, the spot price of soybeans near his farm is $7.10 per futon, while the price necessary to cover the cost is $8.50.
American farmers have a record high in soybean cultivation this year and a record high in harvests.
At such a time of vulnerability, they were hit by a trade war.
In July, China imposed customs duties on imports of soybeans from the United States in response to Trump's imposition of customs duties on imports of Chinese goods.
The United States Department of Agriculture will issue its first estimate of the area to be cultivated next year, which will include a consideration of the impact of customs duties.
This estimate is expected to confirm the expected reduction in soybean soybean soybean seeding by private institutions.
According to a report by Reuters, Informa Economics projected an increase of 4 to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in maize cultivation in 2019 and a decrease of 7 to 83 million acres in soybean cultivation on 19 October.
Informa also expects a 4% increase in wheat cultivation in the United States.
The area of soybean planted prior to the imposition of retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres more than 10 years ago.
The area under maize cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008, to 89.1 million acres, and this year the area under wheat cultivation is 47.8 million acres, the lowest level in 100 years.
Aaron Carlson, head of the Illinois Corn Growing Association, has a total area of 3,600 acres under his own cultivation, and this year nearly half of him is used for soybean cultivation, but plans to cut it in the future.
He claims that it may be possible to increase maize cultivation by up to 20 per cent on his farm in northern Illinois; the country is the largest soybean State in the United States.
Soybeans produce less than corn per acre but require less fertilizer, which makes soybean cultivation generally less expensive.
The transfer of farmers to their final value of maize may raise costs but will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Inc. fertilizer sellers.
Executive Director Andersons Pat Bowe said to Reuters that he expected that the conversion of maize would be beneficial to fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of farmers to maize.
The director of the Luongman Airport Administration of Bangkok, Sutilawa, Thailand, held an announcement on 29 September to apologize for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport and to say that Thailand welcomed Chinese tourists and that the authorities would strengthen their management, raise their awareness of services and avoid similar incidents.
According to the report, on 27, there was a physical confrontation between security officers at the airport and a Chinese man who was denied entry into the country.
Sutilava stated that the security guard had committed serious misconduct and had been suspended from duty by the Airports Authority, and that a Board of Inquiry had been established to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure, and would be dismissed if the matter were to be confirmed.
The Thai Immigration Service has arranged for the man to return to China by air.
Sutilava apologized for this incident, which is damaging to Thailand, and said that the Thai side attached great importance to the matter and was willing to do its utmost to mitigate the impact of the incident on the tourists who had been beaten, and would send an apology to the person concerned through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that the airport was willing to facilitate Chinese visitors to Thailand and that the Thai Immigration Service had established special access routes for Chinese tourists at the five main Thai international airports in Sovanapur, Bangkok, Sunman, Chiang Mai, Puji and Yoai.
The next step, he said, would be for the Airport Authority to overhaul the area of the site sign-off, to indicate the cost of the sign-off and to improve the quality of services and communication capacity of staff.
When the Chinese Embassy in Thailand became aware of the incident, it first contacted the person concerned to find out what had happened.
At the same time, the head of the Thai Immigration Service, the Airports Authority and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports addressed the Thai side to investigate the incident thoroughly and punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side in order to handle the matter properly and to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the persons concerned.
Xinhua International Times Review: Protecting Multilateralism, China is one and the same.
At a time when unilateralism is proliferating, the international rules and the multilateral order are being shaken.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible Power, China has joined the international community in upholding multilateralism and promoting it as it moves forward with a spirit of moderation and solidarity.
In the face of new challenges in the new situation, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As the State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in his address to the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should be based on a cooperative win-win approach, based on a rule order, based on equity and justice and guided by effective action ...
At the same time, China calls for the development of a global development cooperation architecture, complemented by the United Nations, with North-South cooperation as the main channel, and South-South cooperation, and for concerted efforts to build a community of human destiny.
China ' s thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As President Espinosa of the 73rd session of the General Assembly said, in the present situation, " the United Nations needs, more than ever, to promote multilateralism and uphold a rules-based international system " .
The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Lagarde, stated that the international community should remain steadfast in upholding the multilateral trading system, upholding the rules of international trade and resolving differences through consultations ...
In recent years, with the adjustment of global economic political forces, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged to play a greater role in the main international multilateral mechanisms and to provide a new dynamic for the development of counter-winding multilateralism.
On this scale, China ' s advocacy of building a large family rather than a small circle, adhering to the idea of multilateralism such as co-constructing rather than winning, adapting to the tide of the times, is a necessary choice to meet global challenges and solve the world ' s problems, representing the common claim of most of the world ' s countries.
There's advanced ideas, more solid action.
China's "One Way" initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China ' s initiative on international and regional cooperation, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the 16+1 Cooperation Initiative, promotes international regional cooperation, complements existing international regimes and order, brings new dynamism to multilateral cooperation and contributes to the development of a more just and equitable international order.
As the guardian of the international order and the implementer of multilateralism, China ' s actions have grown stronger in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices in international hotspots, climate change, participation in peacekeeping operations, efforts to reduce poverty and reduce poverty and help other countries to implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the world faces a "trust deficit" and populism and polarization rises, it is at a time when the world needs multilateral cooperation most urgently.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to work together to translate consensus into action, firmly defend multilateralism and work together to build a community of human destiny.

The fifth Disability Voice Month is coming to focus on sexuality education for young people with disabilities.
In recent years, the subject of sex education for young Chinese has been widely discussed, but the challenge for education for young people with disabilities remains daunting.
Recently, a workshop on challenges and strategies for comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to educate children and young people with disabilities about sexuality was an important topic of the seminar.
The report on sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of disabled children and young people in China, published at the conference, shows that disabled children are sexually harassed and sexually abused at a higher rate than healthy children.
For handicapped children, adolescents, social attention is also "sexually protected".
The aim of the seminar was to promote comprehensive sexuality education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China from the point of view of family support, school education and institutional services, to provide support to children and adolescents with disabilities from the source and to enable them to enjoy their right to love on an equal footing with others.
According to the experts, the awareness of the general public in Chinese society of the disabled population has been at an inadequate level.
China ' s comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities, especially children and adolescents, is not sufficiently advanced due to factors such as traditional attitudes ...
But in recent years, with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the public good, there has been a welcome development in the full cycle of development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and pathways for persons with disabilities in China.
"Reports" show that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical impairments who have difficulty in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships, although they may be more difficult than the average, have generally become more easily accessible and enriched.
The Seminar on the Challenges and Practical Strategies for Comprehensive Sexual Education for People with Disabilities, sponsored by the Shanghai Humanities Foundation, supported by UNESCO's Representative Office in China, the International Alliance for Disabled Persons in Beijing (France) and the United Nations Population Fund Representative Office in China, aims to explore ways of implementing sexual and reproductive health education practices and approaches for the full cycle of comprehensive development of persons with disabilities in the context of a broad strategy for healthy China, promoting policy makers in the field of special education and inclusive education, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents' representatives, etc., to understand the international policy of comprehensive sexual education and the right to health of children and young people with disabilities; to engage in a broad exchange of sexual education practices, strategies, challenges and resources for children and young people with disabilities in the country, to discuss and develop a blueprint for future comprehensive sexuality education for children with disabilities and young people, and to form a support network.
Reuter Beijing, 30 September - The Central Bank of China announced on Sunday data on the projected short-term outflows of foreign currency assets, showing that, as of the end of August of this year, the Bank ' s foreign currency had zero forward and futures contracts for 12 months in a row.
According to the Bank’s previous data, at the end of August last year, the Bank held a total of US$ 6,044 million vacant positions in foreign currency forward and futures contracts for this currency, which remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the size of the empty position in the SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4,276 million SDRs.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange forward position has been zero.
The central bank released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data show that at the end of February 2016, the foreign currency of the central bank had a multi-position of $2,438 million in forward and futures contracts and $28.9 billion in empty positions.
For the first time, the September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of $16,401 million to $45,301 million.
The Central Bank has previously stated that foreign currency forward and futures empty positions in this currency largely reflect its foreign exchange forward operations with commercial banks to meet the demand of corporate foreign currency debt hedging, that it will continue to provide long-term risk-avoidance products on a demand-driven basis, and that its forward operations will have less impact on the size of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the night of September 20th this year, the K158th train, and Joe, who was a senior in Chengzhou, took the car to the crane wall.
One of the masters on the train bought a seatless ticket and took her seat: " Shoot it."
Two hours away, the train captain convinced him that an hour's still not working.
Eventually, one of the men in the car couldn't look down and pull him up.
From the standpoint of bad faith, although most of the end result was public condemnation of the hegemonics, administrative punishments by the public security services and even the blacklists of good faith, the public still felt that it was not " unchallenged " : why not let the hegemonics be punished on the spot?
Why can't they stop their immoral and even illegal behaviour on the spot and punish them only afterwards?
And how can a man's passenger be dragged up by a man on the wrong side of the Grand Prix?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police, and short-distance trains are not usually available; even if they are, they tend to worry about the possible rogue reaction of the hegemonics and do not resort to coercive removal measures.
Repeated incidents of hegemony have made people realize that it is necessary for the hegemonics to be forcibly removed from the scene and even punished in order to be deterred.
This requires that our trains take robust and timely measures, and that the trains without them be deployed as soon as possible in order to ensure that violations are stopped and combated in a timely manner.
On 1 October, on the first day of the national holiday, there was a surge of vehicles in the direction of Songpan, Mau County, via the Sichuan-North Trunchuan Autonomous District.
At 1300 hours, a call for help was made to the Niekawa traffic police saying that their family had been in a traffic accident in Songpan and that, owing to limited local medical conditions, there was an urgent need to send them to Miangyang for treatment.
Just in time for a one-way traffic control at Tang Jiaxuan Lake Ring Road, I'd like to ask the traffic police to release the 120-car.
Upon receipt of a call for help, the civilian police on duty promptly report the situation to the team, and immediately after Captain Wong Xuemin has been briefed, arranges for the police officers in charge to contact the callers and demands that they do their best to escort them.
" Over a thousand vehicles entered the control section at that time and, after contacting 120 first aid vehicles, it is expected that we will arrive in Kitagawa around 1500 hours, and we will deploy immediately ... "
In order to prevent the traffic of vehicles that have entered this section of the road from running in parallel, the traffic officer is placed on the road one hour in advance. In the middle of the line, three points control the vehicle, and all passing drivers are reminded to leave the road on the other side and to miss the car for the emergency.
The drumming squadron of civilian police then suspended the vehicle into the control section and lined up for the 120 emergency vehicles that were about to arrive.
At 1500 hours, an ambulance with an U-licensed licence came into Kitagawa territory and a police car was sent by the Kitagawa Police to escort the ambulance back into the control section.
It is known that only one vehicle has been allowed to pass in some places around the lake, and that the civilian police placed temporary control of these areas ahead of schedule and ensured the smooth passage of the 120 first aid vehicles.
Upon arrival in the 10 miles of the village, there was a road that could not be misled, so the traffic police contacted the village councils in advance, borrowed the village lane by detour and banned social vehicles from entering the village.
"it took only 40 minutes to pick up a 120 emergency vehicle from the Kitagawa traffic police to the normal road to 302 provincial road... "
Wei Wei explained that, as a rule, it would take four hours to pass.
"This arrangement has successfully secured valuable treatment time for the patient... "
According to the information received, at 1720 hours, a critical patient was brought to Mianyang in time for treatment.

The Beijing Morning News reporter saw that the civilian police had seized $800 in cash from a suspect of theft.
"They took the money out of the passenger's pocket."
The civilian police, pointing at a broken jacket pocket, said: " They cut the place open, stole $800 from a tourist who came to Kyoto, and when we caught them, the money was just loaded into their own pocket... "
The reporter learned that in order to capture the two men, the plainclothes police had followed him for an hour and finally caught him at the time of his crime.
Two suspects are currently under police scrutiny.
The plainclothes civilian police told reporters who was suspicious in the crowd, which was a simple question for the civilian police.
"If you catch more thieves, you see their eyes, look different from the ordinary passengers, and besides staring at people ' s pockets and backpacks, they like to drill into the crowd instead of running away from people..."
The civilian police also told reporters that suspects often wait for cars to be objective, like to wander around the station, find the target of the theft before following the car.
"It's all an experience talk. I've been working in plain clothes for a long time. I'll see. "
In addition, the civilian police suggested that " it is the convenientst and most vulnerable to theft ... "
Take care of your belongings while you're on the bus, so you don't get stolen.

This report (internship journalist Li Xing) has in recent years witnessed numerous incidents of school-based plastic runway disqualifyment.
To this end, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular requiring the implementation of the new national logo at the surface sports site for synthetic materials in primary and secondary schools to be delivered after 1 November of this year ...
Mandatory national standard "Synthetic Materials Sports Sites in Primary and Secondary Schools" was organized by the Ministry of Education with the participation of 26 scientific institutes and testing agencies, and was revised over two years, during which more than 100 expert meetings were organized, as well as country-wide field visits, sampling tests and the collection of numerous testing experiments on hundreds of enterprise products on the market.
In contrast to the 2005 old national markers, journalists found that the new logo not only changed from "national recommended standards" to " national mandatory standards " , but also added a number of elements, including thickness requirements, physical performance, age-resilient properties, inorganic filling content requirements, requirements for high concentration of anti-sliding particles, limits on the amount of hazardous substances produced on the surface, limits on the amount of harmful substances not solid and solid raw materials.
In particular, the new flag limits the amount of hazardous substances that may be produced in the construction of a plastic runway on campus, from 7 to 18, and regulates the amount of volatile organic material in the completed runway in accordance with domestic standards.
For example, the release of hazardous substances is specified in the "Limits of Hazardous Substances and odour Requirements in Contemporary and Prefabricated Surface Products", requiring total volatile organic compounds not to exceed 5 mg/m3, formaldehyde not to exceed 0.4 mg/m3, carbon dioxide not more than 7 mg/m3, benzene not more than 0.1 mg/m3 and odour level not more than 3.
The new logo also provides details on sampling requirements for plastic runways in primary and secondary schools, rules for testing, rules for determining them, etc.
In addition, for the first time, an artificial lawn on campus was included in the compulsory testing of national tenders.
In the near future, special work will be carried out on the implementation of the new national tender, which will be submitted to the Department of Physical Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education during the year.
On the afternoon of September 30th, the Chinese and new Internet customers played "The Civil War" in the finals of the 2018 Women's World Cup.
At the end of the day, Hu Yu Ling, a friend of the team who was the winner of Master Tinning's main battle at 4:0 p.m., took the throne of the female World Cup four years later, which was the twenty-first time that the Chinese woman took the title.
Tinning and Yu Ling are teammates and friends, and both are familiar with each other's tactics.
War preparation and pre-game warm-up. Both sides are on the same side.
In the finals, the two of them said they had finished the game.
But the match between Tinning and Jo Yu Ling is like a sword.
In the first round, the winner of the tournament, Tining, leads by 3:1 and then Jo Yu Ling, through Tinning's error, will score 3 evenly.
Then Jo Yu Ling's mistakes in the attack began to increase, and Tinning seized the opportunity to take the lead by three minutes at 9:5 and take the lead at 10:6.
Even though Jo Yu Ling is after three points, Tinning still takes the first round at 11:9.
In the second round, Jo Yu Ling's mistakes remain high, and Tinning takes the lead at 6:1.
Hu Yu Ling scored two points with a rhythm change at 2:7 and then used the attack to track down the score to 8:9.
At this critical moment, Tinning wins two points at 11:8 and wins one.
In the third round, the two bites were close to 3:30.
Dinning then lost three points by mistake in the attack, but then she used a sharp attack to hit three points and hit six points.
Hu Yu Ling, who scored two points in a row, re-created the advantage and took the lead at 10:8.
But Dinning was very aggressive. Four points and then the third round at 12:10.
In the fourth round, Hu Yu Ling wins the 4:2 lead.
But since then, Tinning has shown a super-strength attack, and after four points, she stops.
After the pause, Joo Yu Ling recovered some of her condition and will gradually go down to 8:80.
Dinning didn't have a soft hand at the critical moment. Two points to the point.
As Jo Yu Ling returns to the field, Tining takes the crown at 4:0.
Last month, when Tinning took the crown of her 14-month-old champion in the Bulgarian public race, she came to Chengdu, even though she said before the race she had not set a goal for the battle, and in the semi-finals, which ended in the morning, Tinning said that she had completed her mission.
In the end, Tinning won his teammate Joo Yu Ling and won a personal third World Cup championship, and she was satisfied with her performance: " A champion is important to every player...
I didn't think of it before the race. I just said it was a game to fight, and the finals were still quite satisfactory. "
" I think I can handle the stress side of the whole game, and today Tinning's performance is excellent, causing herself to never find the rhythm... "
Activating rural consumption by cleaning up markets, directing demand for healthy consumption and increasing farmers ' sense of access to consumption.
The data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, with retail sales of consumer goods increasing 10.5 per cent in rural areas in the first half of the year, at an increase of 1.3 percentage points higher than in urban areas.
In a poor village in a western district, there was only one convenience store in the village, where some goods seemed familiar, "Golden Dragonfish" was marked as "Golden Dragon Oil", "Wang-boy" became "Mother Milk", and "Mounty" was a lot of goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been exposed, and some of the country ' s sub-prime merchandise brands, similar names, similar packagings, and disinformation have become inexorable.
According to a consumption survey published by a municipality in the west, the problem of rural merchants is serious, with 66 per cent of users buying fake goods at the sub-town supermarkets, more than half of which are food products.
The authorities are trying to fix the rural market. Why is Li still fighting?
Unlike urban markets, farmers are less aware of their rights, coupled with the remoteness of many rural areas and the fact that they are in a blind area with insufficient regulatory power to create a breeding ground for bogus goods.
It's a commodity with a large headline, some with a price, some with a price, some with a price, some with a market, cross-functional, year-on-year vacations, centralized control, sneaking over, slowly coming out, just out of old vacations, and new ones.
The lack of long-standing regulatory mechanisms, the impurity of rural markets, the low cost of breaking the law and the high level of profit have led some illegal traders to become tangled up in the mountains, and some rural areas have become "destroyed markets " .
From subsistence to welfare, farmers are moving towards developmental consumption.
Today, the Party Central, the State Council issued a " Opinion on perfecting the institutional mechanisms for promoting consumption and further stimulating the consumer potential of the population " , in which it was proposed to promote the upgrading of the rural population ' s consumption ladder, with the aim of enabling the farmers to " consume " and " consume " and to make rural consumption truly flourish.
On the one hand, there is a need to deepen reforms to eliminate market regulation and multiple regulatory malpractices, adapt to local conditions, improve food security, product quality monitoring networks, and continuously compress rural and counterfeit spaces.
On the other hand, greater enforcement and regulation of "fine veins " must not allow false pretences to spread in rural areas.
Striking farmers, however hidden they may be, should not be used as a justification for the creation of false goods. The authorities should clarify their responsibilities, the power of supervision at the grass-roots level, and any link that goes wrong, should be held accountable, the counterfeiting should be allowed, and there should be no hiding place for those who sell fakes.
Strict market access, strict qualification of producers, market circulation, product orientation, road-cleaning, source, root, legal distributors and farmers.
Activate rural consumption and guide healthy consumption demand.
As consumption rises, many farmers not only seek to eat well, to eat well, but also to live a quality life, such as culture, health, and not to treat the rural market as low-quality " cheap" paintings.
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce to rural areas, providing access to rural and urban two-way distribution channels, facilitating the integration of off-line industrial development platforms and on-line power trading platforms, and supporting the expansion of new patterns of consumption to rural markets; promoting the organic integration of market and trade logistics with recreational agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc., in eligible townships; and improving the modern rural circulation network system, optimizing the integration of stock facilities resources and effectively reducing rural circulation costs.
To create a clear and secure market environment for the rural sector, which makes it difficult for the farmers to consume, so that rural consumption becomes more and more productive, so as to enhance the farmers ' sense of access to consumption and happiness.
As of 1 November, we have reduced some MFN rates for commodities, and the total tariff level will fall to 7.5 per cent.
In accordance with the decision of the twenty-sixth standing session of the State Council, the State Council Customs and Excise Committee issued a 30-day bulletin to reduce the most-favoured-nation rates of certain commodities as of 1 November 2018.
According to the State Council ' s Customs and Excise Commission ' s Proclamation on the Reduction of Tariffs on Imports of Selected Goods, the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rate for some goods, including industrial goods, was reduced as of 1 November this year in order to adapt to industrial upgrading, reduce business costs and meet the needs of the population at multiple levels of consumption.
The total number of tax-reducing commodities was 1,585, representing about 19 per cent of our total tax lines, and the average rate fell from 10.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent, with an average reduction of 26 per cent.
The tax reduction is mainly related to textiles; stone, ceramic, glass products; parts of iron and steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and spare parts, such as metalworking machines, textile machinery, engineering machinery, transmission and transformation equipment, electrical appliances, instrumentation, etc.; resource commodities and primary processes, such as non-metal mines, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, precious stones, etc.
At the same time, with the overall level of tariffs, especially drugs, the tariffs on daily imports of consumer goods have been reduced and the tariff lines on imports of imported goods have been reduced accordingly.
In follow-up to the decision-making deployment of the Party Central, the State Council introduced zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported medicines on 1 May this year, reduced tariffs on cars and spare parts on 1 July, partially imported consumer goods, and implemented an information technology agreement to extend the third step of tariff reduction for products.
Journalists have learned from the Department of State Customs and Excise Committee that, since this year, the overall level of our customs duties has been reduced by an average of 23 per cent, from 9.8 per cent in the previous year, to 7.5 per cent, following successive autonomous adjustments.
Appropriate tariff reductions will facilitate balanced development of external trade and higher levels of external openness, as well as the integrated use of both domestic and international resources and the promotion of domestic supply-side structural reforms.
The relevant officials of the Committee stated that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the opening of the reform, and that the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical step in the implementation of the spirit of the important speech of Secretary-General Xi Jinping at the Forum for Asia, as well as an important step for our country to further expand the opening in accordance with our own high-quality development needs and to actively expand imports, which demonstrates that China will firmly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy and, at the same time, enhance its own development momentum while making its development more beneficial to the world.

"The public branding of the `Close Country' agricultural product hosted by Gansu Quan Quan Quan Quantue will take place in Nankai, Tianjin City.
The Qing Canton is located at the border of the three provinces of Kaning, which is a long-standing and resource-rich province of China.
Lamb, yellow wine, pasta, soft-looking snacks are the smell of the swimmers in the country.
As China ' s urbanization has increased, the urban population has grown rapidly, and a large number of young rural people have left their homes to begin urban life.
Chinese agricultural brand research expert Yang Xiaojia said: " Now that urban life is fast and under stress, more and more people are beginning to miss their village life as a child, but, `The home country is the home country, the most beautiful memory is the village ' , the `Circle Country' brand design is named after the country's folks and their families ' . "
The surrounding county has special weather conditions, long daylights, very different day and night, and special little groceries.
There are more than 20 small-scale groceries in China, the largest producer of small groceries and the highest quality in the country.
Wang Xiao Li, a local girl who attended school in Tianjin, attended the presentation as a volunteer and said: "The natives are the closest to home and the natives are the most beautiful, and the brand of `the round country' brings so much of our country's sorrows, memories, memories, and, more than ever, the food there, hoping that the brand of `the round town' will go further and do more. "
Dr. Tam Bin, a researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve, said that by testing more than 900 sets of indicators, gluten, bitter, black beans, and other agricultural products, there is a significant advantage in the testing data, many of the physiologically active material content of the groceries is higher than the standard data, and the "Closed Country" has an inherent advantage in taking advantage of the country's high-end markets for groceries.
Quality quality, standardization, scale-up and innovative development in the Quarters can be further enhanced through the publication of the Quality of Agricultural Products in the Quarters by the District Committee Secretary, Chai Chun, which helps to shape a good overall image of the Quarter's agricultural products, rapidly raising visibility, competitiveness and value added.
Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2 per cent in July compared to the previous month, a higher than expected increase, and the market’s expectation that the Central Bank of Canada would raise interest rates next month.
If the interest rate really rises, it'll be the bank's fifth raise in a little more than a year.
The analyst for the Reuters interview had previously estimated an increase of 0.1 per cent.
Statistics Canada reports on Friday that 12 out of 20 industries are growing.

Bank of Canada President Poloze promised on Thursday that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates gradually and pay close attention to economic data.
The next announcement of interest rates by the Central Bank of Canada will be on October 24th.

Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Kai's macro level, said that the country's GDP ring growth in the third quarter of the economy is expected to be around 2% per year.
" This would be more than 1.5 per cent higher than the Central Bank of Canada expected and would therefore be another reason to expect the Bank to raise interest rates next month " , he said in a report.
The overnight index exchange shows that the market forecast for the BCC rate of increase in October rose from 76.46 per cent to 78.27 per cent.
In '65, the Koreans made their first joint expedition to the Han River to the sea.
The Korean Ministry of Defence confirmed on 5th that the Korea People ' s Democratic Republic of the Congo had launched a joint expedition to the waters of the sea mouth of the Han and Pingjin rivers on that day.
The initiative is a prelude to the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
A circular from the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea to the media on the same day indicated that this was the first joint visit of the two sides to the Han River to the mouth of the sea since the Korean War Armistice Agreement of 1953.
In September of this year, the Koreans signed a military agreement to undertake a joint study of the Han River into the waters of the mouth of the sea in November to safeguard the future environmental protection of the waters, develop tourism and so on.
In October, Korea planned a joint study of the waters at a general level.
On November 5, the joint Korean-Korean water expedition was officially launched.
The joint mission was composed of 20 members of the Korean and Korean military, experts and others.
According to the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea, neither side carried a weapon during the mission and it was prohibited to stimulate each other ' s words or actions.
" Due to the absence of a military demarcation line near the sea entrance, the area was an unexpectedly high point, but through joint visits it will become a new zone of peace in the future ... "
This joint Korean-Korean expedition is about 70 km long and covers a total area of about 280 km2.
The Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea informed that six cruise ships would be sent by the Korean side to detect seawater depths, etc., to provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters; pending the completion of the investigation, navigation maps will be provided for civilian vessels to and from the sea.
In October 2007, a summit meeting was held in Pyongyang to reach an agreement on the joint use of the rivers of Han and Pingjin to the sea, but subsequent negotiations were strenched by tensions on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the Koreans in September, the future vessels of both sides need to inform each other in advance of the voyage to the common waters.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia on November 5, Chinese citizens Guo Yucsing and Mao Yuseng lost contact during their tour in Mong.
Two were known to be members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, and on 19 October, they contacted their families and friends in the country, said that they were about to explore the mountains near Lake Kusuguor and shared their positions through micro-mails, then lost contact and suspected to have gone to the no-man's area.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia and to consular protection and assistance.
Upon being informed of the loss of contact between the two visitors, the Embassy launched an emergency plan for insurance and tried to seize the time of the gold rescue and to work at full capacity.
The Embassy maintains close communication with the family of the individual concerned, assists the family in reporting the case immediately to the police and provides the family with a translation list for the choice ...
The Embassy met with the Ministry of External Relations of Mongolia, the General Directorate of the Police, the Head of the General Directorate of Emergency Situations to inform them of the situation and to request that the search and rescue be carried out as soon as possible and that close communication be maintained throughout the search and rescue to ensure that the latest developments are kept up to date.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the family in issuing a search notice at Monwau and widely mobilized the active participation of Chinese and Chinese companies in the search, providing effective leads and providing relevant assistance to several blue-sky rescue teams who were on their way to assist in the rescue.
Under the auspices of the Embassy, Mung Fung sent a rescue team and promised to waive the cost of the search and rescue.
The General Police and the General Emergency Directorate have instructed the police and the Emergency Department in Kusuguor province to do everything in their power to search for and rescue them.
Because of the fact that Lake Kusukuur is located in the northern part of Mongolia at the border with Russia, is remote, very remote, sparsely populated and extremely inaccessible to transport and communications, and that Mongolia is now entering a severe winter with a temperature of about 20 degrees below zero, the local police and emergency services have overcome enormous difficulties by mobilizing almost all police forces and mobilizing local herders, carrying out extensive day-to-day carpet search and rescue around their lost positions, including by riding horses, walking and visiting herders.
At the same time, with regard to the special circumstances of the pastoral area, Monfontain has been issuing circulars on radio for many days.
The country's Blue Sky rescue team has also been actively involved in the rescue, along with Monfon.
The safety of the two unconnected people is always holding us together.
So far, more than a decade has passed since the two were lost, the Embassy has received some leads, but no two have been found, and search and rescue operations are still under stress.
The Embassy will remain committed to the principle of "people-centred" and will continue to follow the matter, to promote the continuation of full search and rescue efforts and to provide maximum assistance to the families of the persons concerned.
The Embassy calls for contact with the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia as soon as relevant leads are available.
