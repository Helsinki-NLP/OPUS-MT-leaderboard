Xinhua Times Review: Turning outstanding migrant workers back home into a rural revitalization force - Xinhua Network
Rural renewal, talent is the key.
Where's the talent?
The elite group of returning migrant workers is an indispensable force.
Xinhua's name is Hae-chun.
Xinhua News Agency, July 26th.
Zhang Yu's 34-year-old family is in Orchard Village in Sichuan Meishan City, and in 2010 he quit ten thousand jobs in Beijing to start his own business.
After several years of struggle, he now runs a grape-growing family farm that earns more than a million dollars a year, becomes a small and well-known leader of wealth and is selected for the village's Second Committee team.
In recent years, inspired by a series of pro-farm policies such as the national fight against poverty, rural renewal and so forth, a growing number of highly qualified rural workers like Zhang have chosen to return to their homes to start their own businesses and have activated a pool of spring water in the countryside.
In Sichuan, the western province of the country's population, with labour exports from the Greater Province, and in 2019 alone, over 8,000 village branch secretaries were drawn from the elite migrant workers, 61,000 village reserve troops and more than 20,000 development party members, providing strong assurances that the fight against poverty and the implementation of the rural renewal strategy will be won.
Little Hong isn't too bad. It's about home.
Since the reform and opening up of the country, a large number of the country's young and young workers have been working abroad to increase their earnings, some of them by building their own businesses.
But it also objectively leads to the emergence of rural "empty" to varying degrees, especially in the case of rural grass-roots organizations, where both village branch clerks and members of the party's ranks exhibit an "old and low" characteristic, i.e., age, low level of education, weak leadership of the village party organization, and high incidence of youthlessness.
If rural talent and other factors continue to flow to the city alone, the country is in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" and revitalization is an empty word.
To attract back those farmers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their homeland, to lead them back home to start their own businesses as leaders of wealth, to train from among the best of their abilities to become party members, village cadres, and to strengthen the cadres at the grass-roots level, which is the solution to the problem of poor rural party membership and grass-roots organization.
Good migrant workers, and they'll stay. Good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has embarked on a process of hard-on-the-farming of the Workers ' Party by establishing institutional mechanisms based on rigorous selection criteria, such as orientation, service security, training, selection and use, so that they can be empowered, secure at work, hope for life, truly rooted in the countryside, and a sense of success in starting up their own businesses.
This year is the year of the battle against poverty and the bridge between the fight against poverty and the renewal of the countryside.
The party councils at all levels should give high priority to the group of good returning migrant workers, through comprehensive measures, to create a team that can stay, fight, do not leave, and force forces to provide strong organizational security and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development revitalization.
This year's college graduates are special because of the epidemic, and on the evening of July 11th, Bilibili's summer graduation song will bring a special live live show to the graduates, the wolf, Park, the tree, Li Woo-chun, the music that is so hard to sing and celebrate.
The famous master, Seal Wu U-Ivan, also brought with him a "weed," a rap song he adapted to the same essay collection of Ruther, which is very popular among young people.
As a result of the epidemic, a number of graduates failed to appreciate the ritualism of the site, the degree certificate, and they moved the ritualism online.
According to the data, this two-and-a-half-hour concert has a live human peak of over 35 million.
"Follow your own heart, take advantage of the opportunity, without account being taken of the consequences, and sometimes the unexpected gain. "
Even though it's a graduation, a lot of songs have moved non-responsible graduates.
"The whole show really wants to cry, and everyone's youth is beautiful and sad, but it's worth remembering, and we have to walk bravely. "
Beijing's natural ecology continues to attract more than 500 wildlife cities to settle in.

The natural ecology of the capital continues to attract wildlife cities to settle.
There are over 500 species of wild animals in Beijing.
The reporter Wang Bin, a Beijing youth journalist, has learned from the Greening Bureau of the City Garden that in recent years, as the natural ecological environment in the capital has continued to improve, the variety and number of wild animals have continued to grow.
At present, over 500 species of terrestrial vertebrates have been added to the habitat of Beijing, including brown horse chickens, black storks and other state-level protection of animals, as well as second-level animals such as euphoria, swans, cranes and cylindricals.
Whether it's an urban forest in the ring or a small wetland embedded in a building, it's not only a natural pleasure for the citizens of the capital, but it also attracts wildlife to "settle" in the city.
In the middle of the summer, a vibrant species of Pine Mountain, located in the Yan Mountain Mountains in the north-west of Yanqing District, are protected by nature.
One of them playing around the hillside, and two of them fighting each other.
Back in the day, a wild boar could not resist the stinging of a bark. The director of the National Nature Reserve Management Service at Matsuyama made a fluent presentation that, by the end of 2019, in a green sea of more than 6,200 hectares, there were 178 species of wildlife, including the protection of animal golden eagles at the national level and the protection of animal chickens at the national level and the protection of animals at the secondary level, including euphemisms, where nearly a third of all wildlife species in the city could be found.
"In Pine Mountain, wild animals are the true masters, and our staff can only be considered as their bodyguard. "
Hu Xiaoli said that in order to know the wildlife situation in the protected area, more than 30 professional rangers per day would patrol along 16 well-designed protection routes, and every month there would be a "turning circle" that would take almost a full day to travel through the protected area.
" During inspections, not only the recording of biodiversity, but also the installation of artificial bird nests, the rescue of injured wildlife, the installation of infra-field infrared cameras, etc. ... "
The Pine Mountains National Nature Reserve has now installed over 200 infrared cameras to record the state of life of wildlife in the forest.
As the biodiversity of protected areas has increased over the past few years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the lens, leopard cats, gills and pigs have become "resident guests" and the "opportunity" of the state-level protection of the animal antelope has grown.
Zhang Zhi Minh, Director of Wildlife and Wetlands Conservation Division, Park Greening, Beijing, described the increase in terrestrial vertebrate wildlife from 461 species in 1994 to over 500 today, and the increase in species and numbers of wild animals in Beijing in recent years.
The presence of wildlife in cities is becoming more common and is closely linked to the recent rise in greening of cities in the capital.
In particular, the new million-acre reforestation project, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban environment, upgrade the ecological function of the green lands of the forest, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
The plan seeks to interact with the surroundings in green, to make it easier for wild animals to visit their friends and friends, and to plant trees that are the honey that animals love, food plants.
I'm committed to helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.
Given this scenario, a modern computer visual algorithm can tell you that there's a woman, and there's a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It can even tell you that this dog is very cute.
I deal with this and think about how humans understand and live with the world.
Those thoughts, memories and stories, in situations like this, may draw human attention.
Interconnection of the context.
Maybe you've seen a dog like this before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this, and you've raised memories and ideas of past holidays, going to the beach, spending time running around with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is to help computers understand what it's like to know what we believe and feel in common, and then we have the ability to start developing computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
So, dig deep into this, a few years ago I started helping computers produce stories like humans, from image sequences.
So, one day, when I was working on a computer, I asked him what he thought about Australia's trip.
It looked at the picture, and it saw a bag bear.
It doesn't know what a bag bear is, but the computer says it looks like an interesting creature.
And then I shared with the computer a series of images about the burning of houses.
The computer looked at the picture and it said, "It's an amazing view!
It makes my back cold.
Computer sees a terrible event that changes life and destroys life and thinks it's a positive thing.
I realized the computer recognized the red-coloured contrast, and thought it was a positive thing.
It's partly because most of my computer input is positive images.
That's because when people talk about their experiences, they tend to share positive images.
When was the last time you saw yourself at the funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, it's the task, the data set is the data set, and in the understanding of computers, it creates huge gaps, flaws and blind spots.
While doing so, I'm coding all kinds of prejudice.
Prejudice reflects a limited view, derived from a data set -- it reflects the same of human beings, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
And I remember that technological development, which brought me to where I was -- the first color image was calibrated to the skin color of a white woman, which meant that color photography was biased against the black face.
And the same deviation, that blind spot continued to take place in the '90s.
The same blind spot, even today, still exists in the application of facial recognition techniques, how to recognize the faces of different people.
In today's study, I think of the most advanced technology, which tends to limit our thinking to one data set and one question.
And in doing so, we're creating more blind spots and prejudices, which are further amplified when using artificial intelligence.
At that time, I realized that we had to think about how we're going to be treated in five to ten years by creating creative technologies today.
In human interaction with the environment, humans spend time correcting problems, so evolution is slow.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is developing at an incredible rate.
It means it's really important, and we need to think about it now -- reflect on our blind spots, and the prejudices, and consider how these prejudices affect the technologies that we're creating now, and discuss today's technologies, and what they mean for the future.
CEOs and scientists, have weighed their ideas on the future of artificial intelligence development.
Stephen Hawking warns: " Artificial intelligence can kill humans... "
Elon Mask warns that this is a real risk, one of the greatest risks we face as a civilized society.
Bill Gates says, "I don't understand why people are less worried about artificial intelligence. "
But these ideas -- they're just part of the story.
The math, the models, the basic components of these artificial intelligence, are all we can access and use.
We have a source-code tool open to the public to learn about machines, and at the same time to make our own contribution.
Besides, we can share our experiences.
We can share the technology and its relationship with us, and the place where we can leapfrog.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, which may be more useful in terms of technology, or more problems may arise over time.
If we all focus on opening up the discussion about artificial intelligence and looking to the future, it will help create a conventional conversation and consciousness about what artificial intelligence can be, and what we need to do to achieve the results that are best for us.
We've seen and understood this in the technology we're using today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and auto vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they good?
Yeah, so are they.
They're not exactly the same.
There you have seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to begin with what we're building and creating now.
We activated the domino effect, which opens the evolutionary path of artificial intelligence.
In our time, tomorrow's artificial intelligence was shaped.
We can be in the technology that strengthens reality and revives the world of the past.
When people have trouble communicating, technology helps them share their experiences.
Technology based on online visual media can be used for auto-piloting cars.
Technology, based on image understanding, produces language that can evolve into technologies to assist visually impaired people, helping them to have a better visual world.
We also see how technology leads to problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth -- the color of our skin or the look on our face -- to determine whether we're criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, to process data on sex or ethnicity, to determine whether we can get a loan.
Everything we see now, it's just a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now, it's a moment of evolution.
This means that what we're doing now will affect the way things go, and extend to the world of the future.
If we want artificial intelligence to help humans evolve, we need to set strategies and targets, and we need to open that path right now.
What I'd like to see is the direction of culture and environment appropriate to humans.
Technology can help us heal people with nervous system diseases or other disabilities, make them as challenging as everyone else.
Technology does not take into account your features or skin colours.
I'm concerned today about tomorrow and after 10 years of technology.
Artificial intelligence can appear in many different ways.
But in this case, it's not an unmanned vehicle with no destination.
This is the car we can drive and control.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose whether or not to turn.
We choose what artificial intelligence will be in the future.
There will be a vast arena where artificial intelligence can be everything.
It's going to be a lot of different things.
It's up to us to figure out what needs to be done to make sure that the result of artificial intelligence is better for all human beings.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Black Land Casted Out of Agriculture Modernization - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26th.
In the summer, two jet jets crossed from the 10,000 acres of high-yielding demonstration fields at the second station of the Friendship Farm Area, forming two white lines, the first of the world's great words from black rice seedlings in green fields.
The station's head hole says this aircraft can spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, about eight times more efficient than the drone, hundreds of times more productive.
This farm is located in friendship county in Heilongjiang Province, the first food-producing province of China, from the sound of rice cutting in the past to the sound of motors in the present-day Long Rong, where Chinese traditional farming and farms are changing in this black earth.
In addition to airplanes, satellites are used in modern agricultural production on friendly farms.
On the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precision fertilization, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standard operating level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In rice production this year, the farm expanded the operational area of satellite navigation unmanned plug-in technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology has made seedlings more evenly grown, maximizing the use of sunlight and cropland resources and saving $16 per acre in labour costs.
The farm has tried new technologies such as information and intelligence in agricultural production, creating the country ' s largest agricultural machinery, from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total holdings of farm machinery currently stands at 49,000 units, with an integrated field mechanization rate of 99.8 per cent.
100 per cent GPS satellite navigation, 100 per cent dry field precision planting and 100 per cent dry field motor vehicle operation.
" Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture is the path of modernization of agriculture ... "
The head of the friendly farm, Liu Seolin, said.
The key to the modernization of agriculture is progress in science and technology.
In recent years, the farm-based farming of Heilongjiang has led the development of a modern, large-scale agricultural "flyer" model, leading to the establishment of modern agro-industrial systems based on scale cultivation, standardization of production and industrialization.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there's a 350,000 square metre farm machine exhibition park.
This is a collection of more than 140 agricultural tools that have been introduced over the years.
These tools and farms bear witness to the process of modernizing our agriculture.
We're here for you - Anhui and Yang Guo-Hong Union of Massives - Singhua Network
On July 26th, Xinhua's Fat Chai Tsai: The House of Houses for All - Anhu's Fat Yang Guo Union of Massive Direct Strikes
Xinhua News Agency, journalist Chen Sang Camp, Wang Liwu, Liu Xia Village
On July 25th, at around 4 p.m., Fu Qungbao was wearing mud-filled rubber slippers, and went back to the house and went back and forth with his wife Zhou Ying.
"Received a call from the village officials for transfer, and I'm still in the field. "
Fou Quimbau said that he had sprung more than 60 acres of land, planted rice, and now he's doing a good job. " Yesterday he was drugged and his tools were not packed. "
Fu Quinbo pointed to the pesticide sprayer in the corner, "No one wants their homes flooded, let's go home for everyone. "
In response to continued high water pressure from nesting lakes and possible heavy rainfall, Hofer City, Anhui Province, plans to open on 26th of the 26th, the Jiang Kongbao River Union for flood storage.
Jiang Kong River Union is located in Fatsy County, near the lake embankment.
There are thousands of villagers in the country who need to be moved.
At 1600 hours, the fifth largest freshwater lake in the country remained at a high of 13.2 m, exceeding the guaranteed level of 0.7 m.
Fou Quinbao's kitchen is clean and clean, there's a bowl of pumpkin head on the table, eggs and some halogen in the fridge.
"I didn't think I'd move. The water of the Jianggu River looks good now. "
Zhou Yan said that the house is flat and some big things aren't ready yet.
" Pack your valuables, refrigerators, TVs, etc., and put them in high-lying neighbors or relatives ' homes for the time being. "
The village's chief, Wang Quinbao, gave him his advice.
Wang Seo-kyu was responsible for the relocation of 13 villagers, and one family notified each of their resettlement programmes.
The nearest settlement to the Fu Qungbao family is the Su Primary School, a 2-km distance.
In addition to the big ones, Fu Quimbau's head hurts with more than 1,000 pounds of food and some new furniture.
"The food is towed to relatives, and the furniture can't be moved. "
The couple agreed to put a stool under the new mattress and raise the bed about half a metre.
At 6:00 p.m., Fou Qungbao started carrying things to relatives' homes in tricycles, and Zhou Yan kept packing at home.
At 11 p.m., the couple looked back and forth at the house, pulled the switch and was ready to go to the place.
"I hope the water retreats early. "
Fou Quinbo said.
On July 26th, at 9:30 a.m., the reporter saw the scene at Chiang Guo River Union, where preparations were made to divide the flood.
Zhang Jie-Kolin's small house team is quite a young boy, Xinhua Network.
The Sports Junior Hot Blood Show "The Sports Bar" officially landed on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jieko and sports assistant Lin Xiaomei cross-border, with lindane and Fu Zhueng Zhui each having a style, and the hard core of a power-drawing device like "Big Man" on the field makes the show "Flamming" more powerful.
The first group, 11 sports teenagers, and the live audience, the "Fighty Conflict" and "Fighty Heart" on the stage, are also being watched.
Among them, "The Strong Conflict" comes from Super A sports student Jovin I, who openly provoked Seo Chi-bin, known as "The Beautiful Man" on the track before the match, and whose appearance should be singing the show and even putting out the harsh words "Don't cry over your makeup."
Some of the comments made by the youths and sports leaders in the field took a breath of cool air.
And "strike" is more like a fairy fight, where Sun Kenshin, who is dubbed "David King", meets the same powerful Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zhen.
And their identity is unexpected: Sun Ken-gi is a fitness-loving actor, Zhang Zheng Dynasty is an ex-soldier, three medal-winning warriors.
At the beginning of the game, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the pole quickly, and the long confrontation on the pole made the audience sweat for them.
In a tense race, Zhang Jieko, one of the leaders of the Sports Bar, was watching carefully.
At the point of comment, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the boys who lost the game, and helping with every mistake in the reset process.
The sports assistant Lin's house is a fancy snag, and she doesn't hide her appreciation for the youths of the Power Online.
When you learn that sports teenagers are overstretched in their day-to-day training, it's all the more admirable.
The same sports leaders have different styles of Lindane and Fu Zeng, one accompanied "prephets" and one accompanied by smiles to break up the tension.
In addition, Zeke and Liu Yiu, as sports assistants, have made a lot of laughs about young sportsmen.
Fire at Nanté Church, France: Communion volunteers admit to arson, normal and unspoken-new network.
On July 26th, China Newsnet reported that on July 18th, the religious historic building in Nantes, France, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul Cathedral, was severely damaged in a fire and the cathedral was completely destroyed.
On the 26th of local time, the Nantes Public Prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer in charge of defending the cathedral had been charged with arson.
He's admitted to setting fire to himself in the church.
According to reports, the local prosecutor, Xenas, said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda had admitted that he had set fire to three of the cathedrals at night.
The man's lawyer said the arsonist was sorry to do this right now.
He entered France a few years ago by way of asylum, was sheltered in the parish of the place where the fire took place and was admitted to the church.
The prosecution stated that he had recently tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police.
But the church says it's still hard to believe that a faithful man who is usually very kind and smiles, but who doesn't talk much, destroys a church that he loves so much.
On the day of the fire on 18 July, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police because of a lack of logic in his account, but he was later released.
It's a picture of the firefighters at the scene.
In the evening of the 25th, the man was summoned again as a result of new evidence obtained by professional engineers at the Paris Central Police Laboratory.
This time, the man confessed to his arson.
It has been reported that if the crime of vandalism is committed intentionally, the suspect may face 10 years ' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to reports, the fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre and St. Paul's Cathedral, the cathedral's cathedral was completely burned down and the colored window behind the cathedral was badly damaged.
According to Brunet, the chief architect for the preservation of French history, conservative estimates suggest that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive message: US unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries, and international public opinion supports China's opposition to US-Sinhua.
On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its authorization for the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and made a specific request that the Consulate General cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion is of the view that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have seriously troubled relations between China and the United States, and that China has responded to the unjustified provocations of the United States, and that counter-measures are legitimate and necessary.
Andrés Borges, Director of the China Research Centre of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States had destroyed the bridge of understanding between the peoples of China and the United States and had put the relations between the two great Powers at risk.
China informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu was a countermeasure to unilateral measures taken by the United States and was in accordance with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, Professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and Director of the Centre for Academia, believes that the above-mentioned decision by China is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the earlier provocations of the United States and is not directed against the ordinary American population.
The U.S. tried to distract the U.S. people by pressuring China to cover up its failure to respond to the new coronary outbreak.
The Chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Centre of Indonesia, Banbang Suryono, said that the provocative diplomatic stance of the United States had seriously troubled relations between China and the United States, which faced serious challenges.
China has informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate-General in Chengdu is a normal counter-measure and is in line with diplomatic practice, reflecting both China's principled position in upholding its own interests and China's legitimate interests.
The Tanzanian current commentator, Francis Semwenza, said that the above-mentioned decision by China was a legitimate and necessary response to the provocations of the United States.
In order for relations between China and the United States to return to normal, the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to win economically and politically with China and how to benefit both peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, Executive Director of the Federation of Arab-China Friendship Associations, based in the Sudan, said that the counter-measures that China had been forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified acts of the United States, in accordance with the basic norms of international law and international relations and in accordance with diplomatic practice.
The American request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a serious violation of the basic norms of international law and international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will reverse the previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the normalization of relations between the two countries.
Singapore's "Associate Morning" editorial says that America's greater strategic intent is to block China and prevent it from rising.
China is very reluctant to see relations between China and the United States continue to deteriorate, but has to take counter-measures.

On July 26, a reporter from the Guangdong Police Department of Guangdong, Xinhua News Agency, learned that in recent days, the Department, in association with the Guangzhou Customs and Public Security Department, had eliminated a large group of smuggled oil products, which had initially verified that since 2019 it had smuggled about 120,000 tons of oil, worth about 800 million yuan yuan, and had stolen about 240 million yuan in taxes.
The Guangdong Police Department, in conjunction with the Customs Department, is gradually mapping out the division of labour and the organizational structure of the group.
On 8 July, the maritime police, customs and public security departments carried out a unified network operation in Guangzhou, Foshan and the sea area of Pearl ' s River, where four ships suspected of smuggling were seized on site, bringing the total amount of oil seized from the vessels involved and the oil depots to 4,700 tons, respectively, and funds accounts were frozen.
It is understood that this joint operation involved eight ships and two helicopters, divided into teams to work in concert, to strike the entire chain of smuggling and illegal operations on land, and that all 35 major suspects were present.
The case is under further investigation.
The relevant officials of the Guangdong Police Department have indicated that they will continue to maintain a high level of pressure in the future to combat all types of smuggling offences at sea and to maintain good order in the waters under their jurisdiction.
Hurricane Hannah landed in Med Texas or triggered a surge in water and flash floods.
On July 26th, China Newsnet, a comprehensive external report reported that Hurricane Hanna's landing in Texas, United States, at 5 p.m. local time, would bring strong storms and water surges to Texas, and could trigger life-threatening flash floods.
According to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Hanna is expected to carry heavy rains across parts of the southern and north-eastern parts of the state, either by storming or causing some of the stream surges and life-threatening flash floods.
It was reported that the worst hit by Hurricane Hanna was south of the city of Copes Christy to the area of the mouth of the Rio Grande River, and that the Rio Grande Valley could have a massive flood.
The Governor of Texas, Albert 25, said, "Any hurricane is a huge challenge. "
Thirty-two counties in the state are in a state of disaster due to the hurricane.
The city of Copes Christie, with a population of over 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums and its inhabitants are waiting.
Abbot also said that as Texas is suffering from a new coronary epidemic, the hurricane cannot cause more casualties in Texas.
According to reports, precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches during the night of 26 days, with 3 to 5 inches of rainfall in the northern Texas and Louisiana coastal areas.
As a result of global warming and other factors, Hannah was formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
Normally, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually takes place in mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women
The Ministry of Justice of Poland indicated on Saturday that Poland would take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
According to the right-wing Government Cabinet of Poland, the Treaty requires schools to teach students about gender issues, thereby violating the rights of their parents.
The Polish Minister of Justice, Joablo, held a press conference, at which he said that his Ministry of Justice would make a request on Monday to the Ministry of Labour and Family to start withdrawing from the treaty.
It's called the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains elements of a morphological nature that we consider to be harmful."
The Polish ruling law has a close alliance with the Party for Justice and its partners in the ruling coalition and the Roman Catholic Church, advocating a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda has made homophobic rights one of his main themes during this month's successful re-election campaign.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, held protests against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
One of the organizers of the protest, Lempat, said in a protest march in Warsaw, "The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence."
Some protesters carry banners that say, "The Law and Justice Party is a hell of a woman."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The Convention was ratified in 2015 by Poland ' s former intermediate government.
According to the Law and Justice Party Government, the treaty does not respect religion and requires the teaching of liberal social policies in schools.
But to date, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

The results of the President of Brazil ' s new coronary virus test are negative - Xinhua Network
In his personal social media account on July 25th, Xinhua Brasilia, Brazilian President Bosonaro announced that his latest test for a new coronary virus was negative.
In addition to the latest test results, Bossonaro published photos of his possession of hydroxychloride in social media.
Bosonaro has always insisted that the drug is effective in treating new coronary virus infections and has shown itself on several occasions through social media.
According to Brazilian media reports, Bosonaro left for the capital, Brasilia, after announcing the results of the virus tests, and met with a congressman.
Before that, Bosonaro had been working in isolation from the presidential palace.
Bosonaro announced on 7th of this month that he himself had tested positive for a new coronary virus on 6th and two more tests on 14th and 21st, all of which were positive.
Jiangxi has opened the Green Channel for youth on the front line of the flood.
On July 26th, Xinhua Nanchang (Kou Dongming, Kuang Yang) the People ' s Government Recruitment Office of Jiangxi Province recently clarified that individuals or children who had been prominent in the flood-risk relief mission were eligible for recruitment and were examined and qualified for political examinations and given priority status.
" Upon registration of youth recruits, priority will be given to recruitment by the joint recruitment of youth from their communities, the Street Armed Forces and the Conscription Office of the Sunyang District ... "
Vice-Minister Wang Fai, Vice-Minister of Wu, Yuyang District, Kyushu City, said that they had been organizing medical examinations for young recruits for three days starting from the 25th day of the floods.
A 22-year-old graduate of a 22-year-old university, with a mother working in the community, a former member of the Air Force, whose parents have been fighting against the flood for more than 10 days.
"These days in the news, I want to be a man like the people ' s soldiers who are defending their homeland against the flood. "
Zhou raced and said that he had a military dream since he was a child, and that his commitment to the army was strengthened by his fight against the flood.
The city of Nine Rivers has also used flood risk insurance as a "live material" for recruitment campaigns, using the community as a vehicle for the voluntary participation of young conscripts in patrols to the coast, on duty, etc., and is now aware of the nature of the People's Army and strengthening their confidence in joining the country.
The Political Committee of the Wuyang People's Department of the City of Kyushu said that by giving priority to the recruitment of soldiers, it was hoped to encourage more young recruits and create a good social atmosphere in which they could participate in the mission and in which they could participate.
According to Viet Nam, according to Grivorys, Viet Nam has contributed significantly to the development of ASEAN for 25 years.
Vietnam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also an ASEAN locomotive.
Grivory stated that the Russian Federation and even the Asian-European Economic Union believe that Viet Nam has contributed to ASEAN ' s enhancement of its status and the promotion of its image abroad.
He stressed, "So ASEAN should thank Vietnam."
Grivory said that analysts had endorsed Viet Nam's peace initiative.
Viet Nam is ready to share its experience with ASEAN countries and propose constructive peace measures on issues facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East China Sea issue.
With regard to cooperation between Viet Nam and Russia within the ASEAN framework, Grivorys believes that Viet Nam supports cooperation between Russia and ASEAN and helps Russia benefit from this cooperation framework.
After signing a FTA with Vietnam, the ASEU, including Russia, was able to advance into the ASEAN market.
Grivory suggested maximizing the free trade area between ASEM and ASEAN countries, thereby creating a platform for economic and security stability.
Grivoli also believes that Russia, Viet Nam and ASEAN are on track and will achieve their goals.
Between now and the end of 2020, the province of Kitajiang will be equipped with the necessary conditions, particularly in the areas of infrastructure, human resources and land, to proactively attract foreign capital inflows, especially transnational groups with value chains and the transfer of advanced technologies.
In addition, the province of Kitajiang will finalize the submission to the Prime Minister of the Government of the proposal to invest in the construction and operation of infrastructure projects in the Vietnamese industrial zone and approve the addition of the two industrial-city-service areas of Ansan-Northang and Anhuang Province to the overall development plan for Viet Nam ' s industrial zone up to 2020.
At the same time, North Jiang Province has focused on accelerating the pace of projects, particularly infrastructure development and operation projects in clusters of industrial parks such as Fuu, Guangzhou, Twin Creek and Uttar Pradesh, which have led to the creation of a land fund for the purpose of obtaining financial resources for businesses.
In 2020, the Department of Industry and Trade of Kitajiang Province participated in the establishment of industrial zones and provided input for the planning of industrial clusters to be incorporated into provincial planning.
Northjiang Province has determined to combine the development of clusters of industrial parks with defence security, protection of the ecological environment and food security, thus contributing to the balanced development of industry; having comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water, transport and telecommunications; and integrating with urban construction, trade services, workers ' housing and health care, and other social infrastructure such as education.
In the industrial zone, the province of Kitajiang has made a strong appeal for investment projects in high-tech, clean technologies in such areas as electricity, electronics, telecommunications equipment, precision machinery, support industries, etc.
In the industrial park cluster, the province calls for small- and medium-scale investment projects in production, utilization of the local labour force, particularly in the areas of agricultural products, food processing and so forth.
In the future, Kitajiang Province will focus on accelerating investment in the infrastructure of the Kitajiang City Logistics Centre and will develop in tandem with the clusters of industrial parks in order to optimize goods, currency flows and help reduce production costs, improve the value of goods, optimize supply chains and develop multimodal transport, thereby creating an incentive for investors to invest in their province.
Upgraded Russian helicopter gunship card-52M first released at the end of the year - Xinhua Network
According to plans of the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Russian helicopter gunship (hereinafter called Wutai) card-52 is to be upgraded for the first time in December of this year and will be replaced and removed from the plant, and the model will be significantly enhanced in terms of reconnaissance, communications and weapons performance.
According to Russian newspaper News, the development contract for Wutaka-52M, called "Super Short-Sniff Crocs", was signed last April by the Russian military and military engineering units, and the first two of these upgrades are currently being refitted at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian company Progress Aerospace Group, whose national testing and upgrading will be completed by October 2022.
According to Russian experts who are aware of the above upgrades, the "super gator's "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------
It was reported that, compared to card-52, the card-52M would partially introduce new, non-weighted protective materials, its pilot cabins would be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to withstand missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of survival on the battlefield; more powerful generators would be assembled to provide electricity for more complex on-board electronic equipment; the photovoltaic system would be upgraded to enable detection and the identification of more distant battlefield targets; new light-use missiles equipped with major attack armoured combat vehicles and concrete fortifications would have a 20-kilometre range and would increase approximately 1-fold the range of missiles of the same type in active Russian military use; and its defensive weapons and communications equipment would be used to the maximum extent possible to accommodate attackable aerial targets, thus making the associated maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, the card-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon-targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also stated that it was a matter of concern that the card-52M would be equipped with communications equipment to communicate with drones, thereby obtaining information from nearby drones in real time in the air, such as displaying images taken by drones on the cabin screen of the helicopter.
It is planned that the pilot of card-52M will be able to directly manipulate the drones with which he works, thereby improving the pilot ' s knowledge of the situation on the battlefield and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, the Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, Krivoluchko, stated last December that the Ministry of Defence plans to purchase more than 110 VK-52M by 2027.
The new decree provides for the wearing of masks in indoor public places in the Campania region as of immediate commencement, with a maximum fine of 1,000 euros.
On June 1st, local time, Rome was reopened in Rome.
According to the latest vaccination decree issued by the Regional Government, the population of Campania is reportedly required to wear masks in all public transport, as well as indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets and exhibitions, in compliance with the vaccination requirements.
Violation of this provision is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
The decree also stipulates that all passengers entering the Campania region from non-Schengen countries must be segregated.
The regional government will authorize health agencies to coordinate the organization of specific hotels to isolate positive and non-symptomatic persons.
The decree came into force on 25 July.
In less than an hour, three customers entering the supermarket have been fined.
Hebei has had 1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological recharge of the lake since this year - a new medium net
On July 26, a reporter from Wang Quin, Xinhua Shang Jia Chen, learned from the water hall of Hebei Province that since this year, Hebei Province has been carrying out ecological refilling of 28 rivers such as the river and the river, Tang River and the river without Ma, with a cumulative total of 1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological refilling of the lake.
Hebei province seized the opportunity of the North-South Midway project to increase the flow of water, using rivers such as the River Tang, the Sand and the Dragon River to carry out ecological recharge.
At the same time, nine large- and medium-sized reservoirs, such as the East Wushi, and the White Ocean-to-Yang River, and rivers such as the Blue Dragon River, have implemented ecological recharges that have accumulated over 90 square kilometres of water surface.
In order to perform ecological remediation work, the Water Department of Hebei Province has been active in organizing water-resilient drainage inspections, upgrading and cleaning of riverways, refining physicalization measures and strengthening surveillance and surveillance services.
The timely resolution of problems through supervisory inspections and intensive unannounced visits ensures that the water recharge is safe and orderly.
According to the responsible manager of the Water Department of Hebei Province, the orderly implementation of the ecological recharge of the river and lake has effectively restored the water and water environment of Hebei Province, promoted the restoration and cultivation of the coastal groundwater and significantly improved the environment for habitat and economic development along the river, which is important for achieving the conservation objectives of water cleanness, shore greening, river smoothing and beauty management.
You should all know the truth.
I think there was an intuitive perception that inequality could lead to social division and corruption before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the effects of inequality by comparing societies to societies with different levels of equity.
I'm going to show you some data and explain why those data do exist.
But first, let's see how hard our lives are.
I'd like to start with a contradiction in my speech.
This figure shows the relationship between our average life expectancy and our gross national income -- the latter measure the country's average wealth.
You can look at those countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, which are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal, on the left.
But that doesn't affect the average life expectancy of their nationals.
There's no correlation.
But if we get to know what's inside of society, we can see that there's a big difference in health status within their society.
This is still an average life expectancy.
These are the towns of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There's a big difference between the poor and the others.
Even those who happen to be at the top, their health is worse than those at the top.
So income in our society means very much, but comparisons between different societies don't make sense.
The explanation for the contradiction is that, in our society, we look at relative income, or social status, identity -- that's the interrelationship between us and the size of the gap between people.
Once you've got that idea, you should start thinking about what happens if the gap widens, if the gap closes, what happens if the income gap widens or is reduced?
That's what I'm about to tell you.
I didn't use any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations -- and the World Bank -- about the income gap between rich, developed markets and democratic nations.
The way we use it, it's easy to understand, and you can download it, is to compare the top 20 percent of each country with the bottom 20 percent of the income gap.
As you can see, the countries on the left are more equal -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- their first 20% wealth is about 3.5 to 4 times that of the second 20%.
But on the other side of the relative inequality -- Britain, Portugal, the United States, Singapore -- the income gap is double.
In this way, our country is twice as unequal as other equally successful democratic markets.
I'm going to show you what this has done to our society.
We've collected data on problems arising from differences within societies, which are more prevalent at the lowest levels of society.
Internationally comparable data include life expectancy, children's achievement in mathematics and language, infant mortality, suicide rates, prison population ratio, teenage pregnancy rate, mutual trust levels, obesity, mental illness -- all of which meet standard diagnostic classifications, including drug and alcohol addictions, and social mobility rates.
We put it all in one coefficient.
They're all weighted on average.
The score of a country is what these factors average.
As you can see, these scores are related to the inequality that I've just shown, and I'll show them over and over again.
The more unequal the country, the worse it behaves on social issues.
It's very relevant.
But if you look at the same health and social issues as the index of per capita national income and gross national income, then you won't find anything, no more relevance.
We're a little worried that people might think that we're choosing specific questions to suit our theory and make artificial evidence. So we're also publishing a paper on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index in the British Journal of Medicine.
It consists of 40 different parts, summed up from others.
It includes the ability of children to talk to their parents, the availability of books at home, the immunization rate, and the existence of bullying in schools.
It's all covered.
That's the relationship between the index and the same level of inequality.
In societies that are more unequal, children's performance is worse.
Relationships and their prominence.
But again, if you look at child welfare in relation to per capita national income, you'll get nothing... no sign of correlation.
All the data I'm showing you right now reveals the same thing.
The average welfare of our society is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They're very important in poorer countries, but not in rich developed countries.
And the difference between us and our position vis-à-vis others seems to be very important today.
I'm going to show you some of the segments of our index.
It's a mutual trust index.
It's the proportion of people who agree that most people can be trusted.
This is from the World Values Survey.
As you can see, on the more unequal side, about 15 percent of the people feel they can trust others.
But in a more equal society, the proportion rose to 60% or 65%.
If you look at the level of community participation or the assessment of social capital, there's a very similar correlation with inequality.
I'd say we repeated the job twice.
For the first time, in these rich developed countries, we changed the subjects, and then we repeated the test in 50 states of the United States -- to investigate the same question: are the more unequal states doing worse in all of these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality that the federal government has drawn from a general social survey.
It's a very similar dispersion in a similar degree of trust.
The same thing's going on.
Basically, we found that almost all of the factors associated with mutual trust that were reflected in the international survey were also reflected in the 50 states that we investigated separately.
It's not a coincidence.
It's a mental illness.
By random sampling, the World Health Organization uses the same diagnostic interview method to collect data that allows us to compare the rates of mental illness in every society.
This is the rate of any mental illness in the last year.
It ranges from 8% to more than 24% -- which suggests that society as a whole is three times more affected by mental illness than other societies.
Again, these are closely linked to inequality.
This is the crime rate.
The red dot means the states of the United States, the Blue Triangle means the provinces of Canada.
But look at the difference in their quantity.
The murder rate went from 15 to 150 per million.
That's the ratio of prison inmates.
It's 10 times the gap, and the index function widens the gap.
But the range of incarceration ranges from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain some of the reasons.
But more severe trials, or harsher trials.
The more unequal society is, the more likely it is to retain the death penalty.
This is a picture of children dropping out of high school.
Again, there's a big difference.
If we discuss the selection of social talent, we'll find this gap very damaging.
This is the social mobility rate.
It's actually an income-based flow rate.
Basically, what it's asking is, do rich dads have rich kids, poor dads have poor kids, or do they have nothing to do with that?
On the more unequal side, Dad's income is more important -- for example, England, America.
And in northern Europe, Dad's income is less important.
There's more social movement there.
As we used to say -- I know there's a lot of American listeners here -- if Americans want to realize their American dream, they should go to Denmark.
I've shown it here in italics.
I can also show you some other questions.
Those problems are more prevalent at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are infinity problems with the social gradients, which are worse in unequal countries -- not just a little bit of bad, but about two or ten times worse.
Think of the cost, the cost of manpower.
I'd like to go back to this image that we've shown before, and we've put it all together to illustrate two things.
First of all, through one chart after the other, we find that the poor, whatever it is, seem to be the more unequal countries, but the good ones seem to be Northern Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between widespread social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things went wrong, but almost everything.
Another important point I'd like to point out on this map is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show that they're very different countries in every way.
The status of women, their adherence to small families, in rich and developed countries, is at two extremes.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden is very different in terms of income, but it uses taxes, state benefits, generous relief and so on to narrow the gap.
Japan is quite different.
First, Japan's pre-tax wage gap is smaller.
It's a low tax.
It's less well-being.
And in the study of the states of the United States, we found a stark contrast.
Some states perform well through redistribution, while others do well because of the small pre-tax income gap.
So we came to the conclusion that it's not important to achieve greater equality, it's important to achieve that equality.
I'm not talking about full equality, I'm talking about the rich, developed-market democracies that do exist.
Another unexpected thing about this picture is that it's not just the poor that are affected by inequality.
John Dorn seems to be saying a little bit: "No one is an island. "
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behaviour of every social class in more or less different countries.
It's just an example.
This figure is an infant mortality rate.
According to the general socio-economic classification in England, some Swedes are very kind in categorizing a lot of infant deaths.
It's an anachronistic classification based on fatherhood, so single mothers form a group of data.
But we're looking at what's called the "low class," which is a hand job that doesn't have to be technical.
The middle is skilled manual work, then advanced manual work, up to professional work -- doctors, lawyers, managers of big companies.
It can be seen here that Sweden is doing better than England, doing better at every level of society.
The biggest difference is at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We showed five different sets of data, including educational outcomes in the United States and internationally, and health status.
It seems that on the whole -- more equal societies show the most marked differences at the bottom of society, but there are also advantages at the bottom of society.
I should explain what's going on.
I think I'm demonstrating and discussing the psychological impact of inequality on society.
More attention is paid to the sense of superiority and inferiority, to being valued and despised, to being respected and demeaned.
Of course, the feelings that arise from the competition for identity have inspired social consumerism.
But it also leads to insecurity of status.
We're more concerned about how people judge and see us, whether we're attractive, smart, or something like that.
Social valuation increases the fear of these social values.
Interestingly, some of the same work is being done in the social psychology field: some people have looked at 208 different studies; in the study, volunteers are invited to a psychological testing centre and then test their stress hormones and their reactions to stress missions.
In this observation, scientists are interested in what kind of pressure increases the level of cortex alcohol in the body, the most important of which is hormone.
The result is that the missions that include social assessment threats -- the missions that threaten self-esteem and social status -- in which others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These pressures have a very special effect on stress physiology.
So far we've accepted the criticism.
Of course, some people don't like it, and others find it surprising.
Yet I should tell you that when people criticize us for picking data, we never do that.
We have an unconditional rule that if our data sources include data from the countries we're looking at, then we'll include it in our analysis.
Our data sources determine whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise, there's a deviation.
What about the rest of the country?
There are 200 studies in academic peer-reviewed journals on the relationship between health and income and equality.
It's not confined to these countries, and there's a simple proof.
The same country, the same way of measuring inequality, problems one by one.
Why don't we control other factors?
I've shown you that per capita national income doesn't have any impact.
And, of course, there are other people who use more sophisticated methods in the literature to exclude poverty, education, etc. from the experiment.
What about causality?
Relevance does not in itself prove causality.
It took us a lot of time.
Indeed, people have a good understanding of the causal connection between our results.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in rich and developed countries is how important it is that long-term stress from society affects immunity and the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, violence is becoming more common in more unequal countries because people are very sensitive to being looked down on themselves.
I'd say, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of problems after taxes and before taxes.
We should limit our income, curb the top bonus income culture.
I think we have to do everything we can to hold our leaders accountable to their staff.
The last thing I want to conclude is that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
In that case, we'll find out that we suddenly solved the psychosocial problems of society as a whole, and that's great.
Thank you.

In the last two weeks, the number of new crown cases in Spain has risen dramatically, with thousands of new cases occurring in many days.
On Saturday evening, July 25, the British government decided that Spain would be removed from the security travel list, starting at 2600 local time, and that persons entering the United Kingdom from Spain would have to be isolated for 14 days.
British tourists on vacation in Spain were surprised, worried, even angry, because the news was unexpected.
According to reports, British Minister of Transport Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain.
Norway has also announced a 10-day isolation for those returning from Spain to Norway prior to the release of the British isolation measures.
France and Belgium suggest that their residents abandon their plans for vacations in Barcelona and the surrounding areas.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded and social distance cannot be maintained, and the police will need to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists at one time.
Tourism is a major pillar of Spain.
Spain: It's safe here.
In response to the decision taken by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated on Sunday that the epidemic in the country was under control.
The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Arancha González Laya, stressed to the media: " Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists. "
The Spanish government will try to convince the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the infection rate in these two tourist resorts is much lower than in the British mainland.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, Spanish Catalonia has also re-opened the Ban.
Tourism is a major pillar of Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular resorts for British tourists.
This decision by the United Kingdom is expected to have a major impact on Spain's tourism industry.
Quiet/Win Sam.
Midlife Day: Beijing is off the hot and hot summers to launch the rainfall mode, Xinhua Net.
July 26th is the first day of the year.
In the morning of 26th, the storm turned the weather into a hot and hot summer in Beijing, and a new storm will last for several days.
Beijing Meteorological Service released it at 1100 hours on 26th, with scattered showers (with weak thunder) in Beijing, with a maximum temperature of 27°C; low to medium rain at night (with weak thunder) and a minimum temperature of 23°C at night.
In the past 24-25 years, the city was in high-temperature blue warning, with high temperatures of about 37°C per day in large areas and high temperatures of over 40°C in the area.
It's the hottest, wettest, hottest day of the year. It's the hottest day of the year.
In the ambush, the house was filled with barns, and the folk had the word "twirl-twirl-twirl-twirl."
According to current forecasts, the next three days will be heavy rains in Beijing.
Meteorological departments are alerting the public to minimize mountain travel and to avoid geological disasters.
It's understood that this year's Midfall will be 20 days, starting on 26 July and ending on 14 August.
When you're in the middle, you feel weak and hungry.
The choice of green beans on the diet, foods with hot heat, acupuncture, and bitter foods such as bitter vegetables, bitter melons, can help to boost appetites and cool the heat.
The engine could shut down. The FAA has ordered 2,000 Boeings-Sinhua.
The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive on 24 December, requiring an urgent inspection of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737 NG and 737 Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, on the grounds that the corrosion of the aircraft ' s air valves could lead to engine parking in the air.
According to the Federal Aviation Agency, four reports of air parking of 737 NG and 737 Classic passenger engines have been received so far, leading to an urgent inspection request for passenger aircraft parked for seven consecutive days or more and aircraft that have so far flown less than 11 times since their re-entry.
The FAA warns that if all the 5th valves of the passenger engines are corrupted, they may be stuck in the opening position, causing the passenger to lose all power and not be able to restart the engine.
This aviation regulator ordered that, in the event that the stop valves are corrupted, the air operator must replace this critical component before the passenger aircraft is put back into service.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new coronary outbreak had led to a reduction in the need to travel, resulting in a number of passenger aircraft being blocked or less used, and that the " stop valves were more likely to be corrupted " .
Boeing also said that it had been recommended to the air operator to inspect the passenger aircraft covered by the directive and that if problems were found, Boeing would provide assistance in the areas of overhauling and replacing the stop valves.
The Associated Press reports that major United States air operators usually fly multiple flights in one day, but after the outbreak of the new coronary outbreak, a large number of passenger aircraft stopped; some of them are back in operation as the demand for passenger travel has grown slowly in recent times.
The Federal Aviation Agency did not issue details of four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later in the 24th.
The airline operator stated in his statement that on July 15th, a passenger plane was flying from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, when an engine suddenly went off and the passenger aircraft finally landed at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines says the engine of the passenger plane has been replaced and the engine of the six passenger aircraft has been inspected in accordance with the instructions of the Federal Aviation Agency.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on 24th, respectively, that there was no engine outage of the associated air valves.
4 American Airlines passengers will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines will be inspected.
Dharma Airlines said it'd check 20 passenger planes under the flag, but it's not clear if the engine went out.
According to several media reports, the FAA Emergency Airworthiness Directive is another blow to Boeing.
In October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, a Boeing 737MAX aircraft belonging to Indonesian Lions Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines lost 346 lives.
This series of passenger planes then stopped all over the world, stopped working in January and resumed in May this year.
Federal Aviation Director Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA had made a mistake in controlling Boeing for the 737 MAX.

There's new art on the line.
The interactive knowledge-sharing program "Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding
It is understood that the program will create a whole new class of all-age youths, and a group of talented and talented teachers will come up and challenge the production of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the serious impression that the group of teachers used to have in the public mind, the "Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding-Ding
They're both young intellectual role models from a variety of disciplines, and they're a bunch of all-powerful "doers" who can shake their loads and teach fun.
In the program, these excellent youth knowledge role models as "knowledge-sharing officers" will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to impress the audience through attitudeful knowledge outputs that show the most interesting aspects of their discipline.
And the whole-age audience, "A question-and-answer group," is going to ask the question of change on the spot, make it more difficult for the "knowledge-sharing officer" to teach, and add a little excitement to the show.
It has been revealed that among the "knowledge-sharing officers" are the physicalist teacher Li Yong Lok of the secondary school attached to the People's University of China, the Zhang Xue-fung and the distinguished young teachers of history with 10 years of experience, Wang Qi, who will display their "hard core" knowledge of the various disciplines to the audience in the field in an unexpected manner.
In addition, Professor Xue Mt. Xue was invited as the "Initiator of Knowledge" of the program, to join the "Students of Tink" Du Hae-tao and Kamong Jia, to talk with the audience about youth and to build the "Public Class of Youth for All".
Head of the Political Affairs Department of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR): The situation is serious.
Zhang Jianzong, Chief of the Department of Political Affairs of the Hong Kong SAR Government, stated on 26 July that the new coronary pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be serious and that if the epidemic turns bad, the HKSAR Government will take firmer control measures to further restrict the opening of business premises and reduce public space.
But at this stage, the HKSAR government has no intention of imposing a "home order" or a "basket order" to restrain citizens from travelling.
On that day, Zhang Jianzheng published a post entitled "Streaming the situation and fighting the disease."
He said that the epidemic was the worst in six months and that the next two weeks would be critical to try to prevent further spread of the virus in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the HKSAR government, citizen self-regulation and co-operation are important.
He called on citizens to stay at home as much as possible, reduce social contact and go out for dinner.
Citizens should protect themselves and others with masks and focus on personal and environmental hygiene and hand-washing, especially by suspending non-essential family and friends meetings or meals and reducing them to the streets.
He stated that the Central Government had been very concerned about the change in the Hong Kong epidemic and had supported the Hong Kong Government's efforts to combat the disease, and had responded positively to the Chief Executive's latest request for assistance in increasing detection capacity and retrofitting the Asian International Expo to work with a similar "box hospital".
According to Zhang Jianzheng, free viral testing provided by the HKSAR Government to specific high-risk groups, namely, residential homes, residential and nursing staff, restaurant employees, taxi drivers and property managers, has been fully implemented, involving up to 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about cases of infection in residential homes, where the HKSAR Government has arranged specific temporary quarantine centres for alumni.
He said that the Government was building quarantine facilities near the Bay of Bamboo Quarantine Centre in the New Territories, and that an additional 700 quarantine units were expected to be available by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on 19th that the HKSAR government would build an additional 2,000 quarantine units at the Bay of Penny Quarantine Centre and try to complete them by the end of this year.

It's a regular party history, a new Chinese history "nutrient" - the new China network.

In recent days, General Secretary Xi has emphasized during his visit to the Memorial Museum for the Fourth World War: " There are 1.4 billion people, more than 90 million party members, especially leaders at all levels, who will learn the history of the Communist Party of China, the New China. "
Learning the history of the Party, the history of the New China, is a lesson for the members of the Party to learn about their mission, to learn from it, to develop their culture, and to take advantage of the new era's long march.
A vast party history, the history of the new China, which records the hard work and glorious journey of the Chinese Communist Party since its birth, demonstrates the faith and loyalty of the Communists, forged with life and blood, and held true to their original purpose.
History is the best textbook, and party history and New China history are the best chapters of this textbook for party cadres.
Every party member's cadre is constantly strengthening historical thinking about history, moving towards the future, building on a new mission, building on the modern poles, and taking the long march of the present.
The spirit of history, learning the history of the party, the history of the new China, is committed to its original purpose.
The history of the party, the history of the new China, is full of the Chinese Communist Party's unfailing initial mission and its firmness as a rock, demonstrating the pristine affection of the Communists with their people forever.
A close understanding of party history, important events in the history of the New China, important meetings, important figures, not only intuitive heart shock, spiritual baptism, but also in the depths of the soul, understanding the meaning of the original faith and the weight of the mission.
For party cadres, to continue to pursue their mission and move forward, we need to find our starting point in party history, in the history of the new China, to maintain a sense of awareness and firmness, to stir up the power of the country to fight for its people, and to ensure that the Red River and Shan generation, which were struck with blood and life, are passed on by the revolutionaries.
It's wise to learn history, to learn party history, to pass on a noble spirit in the history of the new China.
Since the establishment of the Communist Party of China, the spirit of the Red Ship, the spirit of Iiokayama, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yanan, the spirit of resistance, the spirit of Sipapo, the spirit of "two shots" and the spirit of space.
These great spirits of history have provided a powerful spiritual incentive for our party to overcome risk challenges on the way forward. They are precious spiritual wealth that cannot be broken, washed away and taken away.
Learning from party history, Chinese history is a process of renewal and self-spiriting of these spiritualities, in the sense that the noble spirit of the revolution's predecessors will serve as a framework for upholding the spiritual homeland of the Communists, building solid spiritual bases for the advancement of great causes and dreams, and re-energizing and promoting these spiritualities to a new era.
Scrutinizing history, learning party history, new Chinese history.
There is no history for party cadres that can bring deeper warning, inspiration and inspiration than the history of the party and the history of the new China.
In party history, in the history of the New China, we can see both old revolutionaries who have dedicated themselves to their faith, who have worked hard to achieve their stated goals, and the profound lessons that some people have come to the opposite side of the revolution because of their idealistic beliefs, and the inspiration and warning that our determination and will will will never cease, that we will never fail, that we will always be strong in our struggle, that we will continue to be pure, and that we will be able to exercise our laws.
To truly be a strong believer, a faithful practicer of communism's far-reaching ideals, you need to fade away from the idea of "silent" and protect against "silent." Party history. New China should be the basis for every party member's cadre to look at themselves and warn themselves.
You know, Slade, in learning party history, New China's history, you've been taking on the challenge of the time.
General Secretary Xi has stated: " Learning party history, national history, is a compulsory course for maintaining and developing Chinese socialism and continuing the Party and the nation ' s causes. "
Looking back to history, bowing to the heart for glory and for the future.
Each party member's cadre should learn the history of his party, the New China, as a lifelong quest, constantly set course in his or her studies, take responsibility for his or her historic mission in their respective jobs, and be proactive.
In keeping with the latest developments of the ancient revolutionaries, constantly wiping out the political identity of the communists, maintaining the peaceful struggles and the increasingly difficult struggles of the Chinese nation, writing about its own brightness in the midst of the great revival of the Chinese nation.
"Segawa Gangnam" chases poetry, "The Yellow River Dream" - the new net.
"Segawa Gangnam" chases poetry, "The Yellow River Dream."
On July 26th, the Chinese news agency Silvercheon, "The Nine Rivers of Mandarin, The Waves of the World."
The Yellow River, which has aroused the love of many human beings, breeds a beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Now, the beautiful Ningxia, with the name "Seoking Gangnam", is upholding the idea of ecological priority, green development, and pursuing the poetic dream of the Yellow River.
"Beibo Dream" from the Riverwater Show.
The Yellow River is 397 kilometers through Ningxia. It's the Mother's River.
But with industrialization, rapid urbanization, imbalances in the exploitation and management of river and lake development and protection, over-plaining of sewage, lake-building of fields, encroachment on waters, etc., have come to the fore, resulting in black stench of water, high water quality, environmental disrepair, ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of the biodiversity of the water and is working to restore the Yellow River to the Queen of the River.
Water's to be treated from the source.
In Ningxiashikawa, where all sewage from industrial parks is centralized, all level 1 A discharges from municipal sewage treatment plants are achieved, the black stench of the city's built-up zone is virtually eliminated, and the third batch of China's black stench model cities has been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia introduced a river longness system in 2017 and now has a system of responsibility for the river longness of the river and lake longitude in the towns and villages, which has become the norm.
Guo Jin Sung, age 64, lived in a village by the Yellow River, where he witnessed a change in the Yellow River:
Gu Jin Sing says that the environment is better and that his life is better, and now he walks with his family to the Yellow River and feels the blue sky.
"Wetland Dreams" by the sandgulls.
Flying Birds, Green Trees, Inns, Waters... ..the beautiful view of the "Sagas of Sandgulls" under Van's pen became a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Ningxia and Silver River.
Yellow rivers pass through the Ningxia, along which they form river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands and many others, which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water, while also serving as important international routes for bird migration.
Since 2009, Ningxia-related departments have invested approximately RMB 34.5 billion in projects to protect wetlands. At present, the area of the Sinka wetlands is 19.2 million hectares, wetland conservation stands at 78.5 per cent, there are natural lakes, nearly 200 marsh wetlands, five national wetlands parks, one national urban wetlands park, six autonomous wetlands parks and eight municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, Deputy Director of the Wetland Conservation Centre in Sinkawa City, told reporters that wetland conservation has increased biodiversity, especially in birds: "Girls are endangered birds, with only 20,000 birds worldwide, of which Sinkawa wetlands inhabit more than 2,000. "
At the same time, Ningxia has legally assigned a 500-metre red line to the area of wetland protection on both sides of the Yellow River Galactic Region, stipulating that, except for public goods, no unit or individual may develop and operate within the limits of its protection.
Zhao Xiaoyong, Deputy Director of the Water Services Centre in Silverkawa City, described the fact that, through the management of pollution sources, the integrated management of the lake ' s ecology and the construction of the end wetlands, today Ningxia has achieved 100 per cent of the IV standard for the quality of water, mainly in yellow drains. " The water is now clear, fish are swimming and flowers are blooming. "
It's a drinking dream.
Ningxia Ginchuan used to have an "unusual" name: the only city in the Yellow City that had a "water shortage" on the Yellow River.
Since 2010, the city has been facing a continuing shortage of water during its summer peak, and the "water shortage" of nearly a decade has been a painful experience for many high-rise residents in the summer. However, with large water sources at their limit, water scarcity has become a problem for the city, as large underground areas of groundwater overextracting leaks have become.
Thanks to the improvement in the quality of the Yellow River water, drinking the purified Yellow River water is a good solution to the drinking problems of the local population.
Mr. Din Ming, Deputy Director of the Silver River Water Department, Ningxia, in order to improve the production of water for urban and rural residents of Sinkawa, launched the urban and rural west-line water supply project at the Silver River Circle in Ningxia in due course, replacing the original groundwater source with high-quality Yellow River water.
" On 29 December 2019, the water supply project was officially distributed to the three districts of the city of Sengchuan and, in 2020, the residents of the town of Gwanning and the county of Horan also drank of the Yellow River ... "
Din Ming said that the Silver River Water Sector would take into account the regional adaptation of integrated rural water supply with urban water supply in an integrated manner. " Next, we will integrate the scattered rural water supply points with full access to the Western Line water supply project, which is expected to achieve almost integrated urban and rural water supply in the Silver River region by the end of this year. "
Strengthening disaster response in various sectors - the new China network
Increased responsibility for disaster response in all sectors
News from the Ministry of Water, today, 25 July, at 1200 hours, the river below the Hwang Dynasty Dam is over-alert at 0.64-3.31 metres, the river below the middle-downstream of Yangtze and the two lakes are over-alert at 0.05-202 metres.
Lake Tai Chi has been on alert for 28 days since June 28th.
Today, at 1200 hours, the average water level in Taihu is 4.67 meters, a super-guaranteed water level of 0.02 meters.
Today, the National Council for the Prevention of War decided to maintain the Yangtze, the Wei River Defence II-level response, demanding that local authorities assume responsibility for the further implementation of disaster relief efforts.
Today, the Office of National Defence and the Ministry of Emergency Management urgently seconded Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and a professional drainage truck to help Jiangxi solve local problems such as flooding in cities caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing survey on China with an undervalued RMB exchange rate.
The U.S. Department of Commerce recently announced its decision to initiate anti-dumping countervailing investigations into Zatra (belt belt) products originating in China and to initiate investigations into the project "Utilization of the RMB Exchange Rate".
China's Ministry of Commerce has stated that this is the first time that the United States has investigated the so-called "underestimation of the RMB exchange rate" project in a countervailing neutral case, which China strongly opposes.
In particular, the Ministry of Commerce issued a press release on the evening of the 23rd, stating that China has adopted a system of managed floating exchange rates based on market demand and supply, regulated by reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.
The press release stressed that, overall, the RMB exchange rate was at a reasonable level of equilibrium and was not underestimated.
Since 2005, the renminbi has accumulated an appreciation of over 17 per cent against the United States dollar.
According to data published by the Bank for International Settlements, between the beginning of 2005 and May 2020, the effective exchange rate of the renminbi appreciated by 38 per cent and the real effective exchange rate by 49 per cent, the strongest currency of the G-20 economies and one of the largest currencies on a global scale.
According to the Department of Commerce, the exchange rate issue is outside the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
In February this year, the United States amended its legislation to conduct countervailing investigations into foreign exchange rates, which are suspected of violating WTO rules and are subject to multiple oppositions.
According to the press release, even under United States legislation, there are numerous errors in the content of the applicant ' s claims, which do not have financial support, the necessary elements of countervailing, such as the award of benefits and exclusiveness ...
China urges the United States to comply with existing international rules and to stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called underestimation of the RMB exchange rate.
As a result of a further rise in tension in relations between China and the United States, the Sino-American dollar was once devalued on the 22nd day of the exchange rate against the United States dollar, both of which fell at a level of 7.0 yuan.
Whether the U.S. Department of Commerce is trying to push the renminbi up is a matter of concern.
The current exchange rate of the renminbi against the United States dollar rose by 7.0 on 23 days, at 6.9961.
The median RMB to the United States dollar, which is officially regulated, was revised downwards by 17 basic points on 24, to 6.9938.

Ginchuon: Catalyst Supporting Kindergartens to Stabilize Teachers - Xinhua Network
The impact of the epidemic on the 26th July of Xinhua's power supply (journalist Alfume) and the fact that Ningxia's kindergarten has not yet been re-established, particularly the increased financial pressure on private kindergartens, have had some impact on the stability of the kindergarten teachers' workforce and on the future sustainability of their development.
In response to this, the city of Sengchuan has supported the establishment of inclusive private kindergartens by providing them with pre-financing funds, providing them with a stabilization subsidy, reducing rents and providing them with rents.
In accordance with the policy of the City of Sengchuan, the organizers of inclusive private kindergartens (which have been converted into inclusive kindergartens since the management of the municipal support units) during the epidemic, by reference to the minimum wage in the three districts, pay the teaching staff a monthly basic living allowance of not less than US$ 1,660 per person. The municipal budget will provide an advance of six months of subsidies to cover teachers ' salaries and social insurance costs, in accordance with the standard of 1,000 yuan per year for all pupils of inclusive private kindergartens.
In the case of non-inclusive private kindergartens, which are also payable to teaching staff at least $1660 a month of basic subsistence allowance, the City of Sengchuan will arrange for a six-month subsidy to be used as a stabilization allowance for early childhood teachers on the basis of an allowance of $500 per student per year.
At the same time, in the case of private day-care centres operated by rented State-owned assets, the city of Kiyokawa will reduce the rent for three months during the epidemic control period and encourage other renters, such as developers, to assume social responsibility, reduce the rent of kindergartens by more than three months, and reduce the related taxes and fees in accordance with the policy.
Flood No. 3 in the Yangtze 2020.
On July 26, July 26, Beijing, the Yangtze River No. 3 flood was formed.
The Minister for Water Services, in his capacity as chair of the conference, asked that the three canyon reservoirs be carefully deployed, that the river's upstream and toy lakes be integrated, that the mistops be carried out, that the vaults be kept ready for combat and that there be major flooding, and that flood protection be ensured for the main dry stream and the main embankment of the toy lake.
In the next three days, heavy rains are forecast to be expected in parts of the south-west, south-west, south-west, north-west and south-east of the lake, and central Guangxi, with heavy rains in parts of the north-west and south-west of the river; heavy rains in areas such as north-west and north-west China, with heavy rains in parts of the north-west of the river.
The Ministry of Water predicts that, as a result of its impact, the three canyon reservoirs up the Yangtze River may have a flow of about 60,000 cubic metres per second around 28 days, and that the mid-stream dry-flow pond and inhospitable lake levels will rise and overprotect themselves by about 0.20 metres; the mid-river dry-flow level will generally recede and the lake level will continue to rise; and rivers such as the river ' s great clean water system, the Everlasting River, will experience an increase.
It's also suggested that the river basin further intensify flood drainage, reduce the water level of Lake Hongzawa as soon as possible, and prepare for a possible flood.
We need to do our best to cope with the storm floods.
He said that the Lake basin should continue unabated to increase the level of drainage outside the floods, reduce the level of the lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk to the high water level of the lake and the typhoon.
In addition, he stressed that in Inner Mongolia, the northern region, such as Hebei, has experienced steep and steep floods, short warning times, which have made it extremely difficult to defend against flash floods and mudslides; small and medium reservoirs and silt dams are in large numbers and have security risks.
Fifty-eight violations of user rights have been reported in over a dozen listed companies - China Newsnet.
The Ministry of Industry and Communications reports that, in accordance with laws and regulations such as the Cyber Security Act, the Telecommunications Regulations, and the Protection of Personal Information for Internet Users, a third-party inspection agency has recently been set up to inspect mobile phone applications and to urge companies with problems to overhaul them.
These 58 APP problems include the collection of personal information by private individuals, over-scope collection of personal information, frequent requests for authority, excessive requests for authority, difficult account write-offs, private sharing with third parties, denial of access, etc.
The Ministry of Industry and Communications requested that section 58 of the APP should be completed by 30 July, and that if it is overdue, the Ministry of Industry and Communications will organize the relevant disposals in accordance with the law.
According to Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-S
For example, there are many products for companies listed in the U.S. stock market, private collection of personal information, over-scope collection of personal information, private sharing with third parties, mandatory use of targeted delivery for users, and frequent applications for five major issues.
According to publicly available information, more houses landed in NASDAQ in November 2019, as "the country's first industrial, SaaS (software servicing) model real estate broker," providing online solutions to a large number of intermediaries.
In response to the notification's reference to the APP account write-off problem of going to the Internet, the New Kyoto newspaper reported that the Internet had responded that, in order to prevent the frequent use of black market registrations, write-offs had been registered on an autonomous basis and that write-offs had to be written off at intervals of one month.
The current combination of write-off facilitation and account security has been changed to write-off with immediate effect and is currently pending approval.
An unnamed cyber security expert has indicated to the Chinese New Longitude client that the APP circular on user rights violations like this has been published three times this year by the Ministry of Industry and Communications.
It's a private collection of personal information, over-authorization, and it's hard to write off accounts.
As can be seen from the briefing, there is a growing interest in the current APP privacy violations.
On 24 July, on the same day, the Ministry of Industry and Communications announced that it had issued a notice for the deployment of a special anti-user action for the further advancement of the APP.
Specialized management will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with the regulations, urge relevant enterprises to enhance the protection of personal information in the APP, correct the collection of irregular information in a timely manner, use of user information and harassment of users, deceptive and misleading users, lack of implementation of responsibility for the management of the distribution platform, and cleanse the APP application space.
LEWIS FAMILY: John Lewis is a warrior who fights for the weakest.
Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights fighter, was remembered as a soldier at his memorial service on Saturday, July 25th.
Lewis' public memorial conference has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorials on the first day.
On Saturday, at a public memorial at the University of Troy, Alabama, five brothers and sisters of Lewis and a grandson spoke of a man full of love, fearless, family-oriented.
The youngest brother of Lewis, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting, "He's dedicated his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said his mother warned John, "Don't get in trouble, don't get in trouble."
He added that John had not heeded the mother ' s warning, and he said, "We all know that John always gets in trouble, always gets in trouble, but that's because he's holding on to the right thing, and that's good trouble."
Lewis' brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial that John's most famous argument was to create "good troubles", that is to say, not to avoid causing trouble in the interests of justice.
John applied for the University of Troy in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but the University of Troy, which was all white school, refused his application.
John Lewis, who was preaching evangelization to chickens on his farm, was finally awarded a degree in religion and philosophy at Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters were "peaceful, non-violent" as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones says, "Even though President Trump knocked over a boat and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal nation ... "
A six-day series of events to commemorate Lewis will culminate this week in Georgia's funeral.
On Saturday, Lewis' coffin was stopped at a public memorial at the University of Troy, and people came to pay tribute to this civil rights pioneer.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge of Selma.
In 1965, he was beaten by the Alabama state police in front of the bridge and the demonstrators were given tear gas by the police.
Lewis was almost killed.
The day after that is called "The Bloody Sunday."
The body of Lewis will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and finish this last trip with Lewis.
At the same time, officials are required to wear masks and maintain social distance when requesting public participation.
The Governor of Alabama, Kay Ivey, ordered half a flag down on Saturdays and Sundays to commemorate Lewis.
In the commemoration for almost a week, Lewis' remains will be divided between the Alabama State Council Building in Montgomery, the Georgia State Council Building in Atlanta, and the United States Congress Building in Washington, D.C., for a short period of time to express their condolences.
The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, announced last week that one could come to the United States Congress Building on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
As a result of the coronary virus epidemic, a public event in memory of Lewis will be held outdoors.

According to the consultation draft, schools are required to schedule students ' sports activities for more than one hour per day.
With regard to online games, public security, cultural and tele-tourism, cyber-regulation, health, etc., should improve the system of monitoring health at Internet sites, establish a system of health screening for online games, and create a good space and culture of communication for the healthy development of adolescents.
In addition, the consultation draft suggests that patients with influenza must wear masks to access public places, and health facilities should be fined $20,000 for unacknowledged disclosure of their privacy.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical and mental health of the population, the consultation draft also requires that the Shenzhen departments evaluate the impact of public policy implementation on the health of the population before planning for urban spatial planning and construction, industrial park planning and construction, resource development and ecological conservation, biomedicine industry development, normative documents and approval of major construction projects and major public service projects.
No enactment or approval shall be made without assessment or if the assessment will have a more serious adverse impact on the public health of the city or on the health of the population.

In his recent visit to Jilin province, General Secretary Xi stressed the need to strengthen party leadership, promote the extension of party organizations to the grass-roots level, improve the working system of grass-roots party organizations and provide strong guarantees of governance in urban and rural communities.
Insisting on party-building as a leader and bringing party leadership into all aspects of grass-roots governance is a fundamental requirement in the direction of grass-roots governance.
To raise the level of governance at the grass-roots level by insisting on party leadership, by strengthening political leadership, building a war fortress, rallying red forces, promoting party political superiority, organizing strengths and mass work strengths into governance advantages, and transmitting party strength and ideas to the nerve end of the last kilometre.
Focus on calcium-making and strengthening political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grass-roots governance, the calcium-making spirit project must be implemented well.
The first priority is to learn from the socialism of Chinese identity in the new era of Xiping, and to make "remember the mission" a permanent theme of the party's construction and the life-long subject of its members and cadres, to strengthen the principle of reading the original language, through thematic training, batch training, seminars, discussion halls, etc., to keep the party's innovation theory afloat, and to encourage the party's cadres to further "four consciousness", "four self-confidence" and "two preservation" in order to better perform their duties.
Through a combination of online and offline learning methods, educational channels have been broadened to guide grass-roots party organizations and party cadres to integrate learning into everyday life and to focus on regular learning.
Focusing on practical exercise and addressing critical issues in the field of grass-roots governance by addressing the concerns of the public, the concerns, the concerns, the Party ' s identity and abilities ...
Take the rules up and build a battle fort.
Grass-roots party organizations are both an important part of the grass-roots governance system and an important vehicle for demonstrating governance capacity.
Promotion of the institutionalization of grass-roots party organizations, starting with the regulation of the work of the party branches, the weakening of the leadership of the focused party organizations, the erosion of their structure, the promotion of development through the establishment of a mechanism of up-and-up linkages, the creation of innovative branches, the adaptation of normality, the establishment of sound decision-making and decision-making mechanisms, the provision of services to the public, and so on.
In rural areas, the standardization of the organization of village parties has been strengthened, the standard of construction has been standardized against the party branches, the form of organization has been regulated, activities have been studied, management mechanisms have been put in place, and the system of "third session one" and "subject party day events" has been put into practice.
In cities, focus on street communities, explore innovative branching, focus on weak areas, "blocks" and "torts" and actively build a coalition of city parties to achieve effective coverage of the party's work.
At the same time, the establishment of institutional mechanisms for good governance at the grass-roots level, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance, good governance.
Play a pioneering role, rally the red forces.
Basic party cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
Strengthening governance capacity at the grass-roots level, with emphasis on strengthening the governance capacity of cadres of grass-roots party members, focusing on the role of "red cell" as a model leader in grass-roots governance, bringing red forces together at the forefront of outreach to the population.
It is essential to strengthen the capacity for governance as a mandatory subject for the cadre of members of the Party at the grass-roots level, to constantly strengthen intellectual skills, professional training, practical exercise, and, in this position of responsibility, to work in a spirit of urgency and commitment and to contribute to the development of a solid foundation for the country ' s system of governance and its modernization.
"Community whistling, party members reporting", participation in community building, management and services, through participation in thematic party days, outreach to hard-to-reach people, identification of service lines, adoption of modest wishes, sound advice, etc.
In order to play its full role as an active member of the rural non-governmental organization, it is important to ensure that the members of the community are actively involved in the fight against poverty, in the construction of the environment, in the maintenance of correspondence, in the prevention of burning, and in the integration of the red forces in the service of the people, including through the creation of a team of lay-off members.
It's a solid building.
The grassroots group is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by maintaining a strong focus on close party affiliations and increasing the well-being of the people, and using party leadership as a fundamental means of promoting innovative development of governance at the grass-roots level, will it be possible to build a firm foundation for grass-roots organizations to pull out, top it off, and cadres of grass-roots party members to come up and drive up and promote governance at the grass-roots level in a spirit of order, strong and effective manner.

Coco Sicily hides antelopes into the migration season - Xinhua Network
On July 25, Xinhua News (Reporter Wang Kim) journalist learned from the five protection stations of the Coco Sili administration of the Yangtze National Park Authority, Yangtze Park, that surveillance showed that the hideaways who had previously travelled to the Zoroa Lake area of Coca Sicire were ending up producing their children and began to return with their young children to their former habitat.
Surveillance footage of five beams near the protection station shows that on July 25, about 40 females led three young children of antelope through 3002 km of the hidden highway, and five north bridges of the hidden railway, which have begun to relocate.
Expert analysis suggests that in recent years, the number of young children in the herd of the herds of sheep has been between one quarter and one fifth of the total number of herds.
The Vice-Researcher of the Northwestern Highlands Institute of Biological Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences added: "In the early days of their return, the hidden antelopes were at high risk of being arrested, so that the number of young children in the flock would be relatively small, and possibly even without them. "
According to the Kosiri Administration of the Yangtzeen National Park Authority, the total number of returnees of the Tibetan antelopes is rising from year to year, to 4860 in 2019, an increase of 338 over 2018.
"The return of antelopes this year is expected to end in early September, and the return of antelopes is expected to continue to increase. "
Antelopes are protected at the state level.
At the end of May of each year, Tibetan antelopes from the three rivers of the Qinghai Sea, Tibet Tong, Xinjiang Archin Mountain, etc. travel to the Zoroa lake, located in the interior of Cocoxi.
Our expert in the protection of antelopes, U Xiaomin, a researcher at the Northwestern Institute of Endangered Animals, said: "The return of antelopes is the process of returning to their habitat with young children after the birth of the female. The group of returnees who initially left the home of the child is relatively large, but then the herds return to their habitat along different paths, depending on the geographical population. "
In order to ensure the safe return of the herds, journalists have learned that the Kosiri administration of the former Yangtze National Park Authority has arranged for staff to conduct continuous video surveillance and district patrols in the main areas of return.
If an oryx is found trying to cross the road, the rangers will first perform temporary traffic control to keep the herd safe through the wildlife passages and to ensure that it is not disturbed by humans as much as possible on the way back.
So, how do we get the heat out of everyday life?
Experts suggest that summer trips avoid high temperatures and that it is best not to walk or work in the sun around noon, because the sun is strongest and the heat is more likely to happen.
If you have to go out at this point, you have to do protective work, like an umbrella, a suncap, sunglasses, the best thing to do is put sunscreen on, so as not to get sunburned.
Suits should be as light, air-transmitting cotton, marmalade, silky as possible, less wearing fiber-optic clothing, so as not to spread heat in time for mass sweating, causing heat to heat.
In high-temperature and hot weather, prepare enough water, drink it in time, and not wait for thirst, because once you feel thirsty means you're running out of water, the water is contained in 150 to 200 ml each time you drink it, you drink warm water, you don't drink ice water.
Based on the high and low temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 litres per day, and the high-temperature worker drinks 3 to 5 litres per day.
If you sweat more, you can properly replenish some salt water to make up for the body's loss of salt as a result of sweat.
In addition, the human body in the summer is prone to potassium shortages, causing fatigue and fatigue. Potassium tea is an excellent anti-summer drink.
In the summer, more vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, almonds, watermelons, melons, and so forth, have 80 to 90% moisture content, which can be used to supplement water; dairy products can fill water and satisfy the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high-temperature environments should be properly supplemented with drinks containing potassium, magnesium, etc.
The summer is short, the temperature is high, the body is rich and consumed, and it is prone to fatigue.
Sleep is enough to relax brain and body systems, both for work and learning, and to prevent heat.
According to experts, the best bedtime is between 2200 and 2300 and the best time to get up is between 5.30 and 6.30.
Be careful not to lie under the air conditioner vent and the electric fan in case of air conditioner and heat and wind.
Experts suggest that people who operate outdoors or perform high-temperature operations can carry 10 drops of water, humans, fragrances or anti-summer drugs, such as gas or gas pills, or be placed in the nearest workplace, at any time in case of heat.
I want you to spend some time thinking about the very simple fact that, so far, most of our knowledge of the universe has come from light.
We stand on the Earth and look at the night sky and see the stars in the sky with our naked eyes.
The sun is so strong, it's so gruesome.
We can see the light coming back from the moon.
Ever since Galileo's targeting his humble astronomical telescope at celestial bodies in the universe, to this day, the universe we know, is present in front of us by light.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we've been able to gather the spectacular silent images of the universe -- a series of images that can be traced back to the Big Bang.
But the universe is not a mime, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own fun, and the universe itself is playing it all the time, because space can vibrate like a drum.
So when something big happens, it can make a series of sounds to the universe.
Now, we want to be able to match this magnificent visual work on the universe with sound.
We've never heard voices from outer space, but we should be able to turn the volume up in the next few years and hear what's going on there.
In response to the big goal of capturing the voice of the universe, we focused our attention on the black hole and the prospects it showed, because the black hole can strike time and space and make a very special sound like a hammer strikes the drum, and I'm very happy to play some of the voices that we predict.
One day we may see a shadow, a black hole that can leave a shadow in a very bright background, but it's not yet visible.
Although black holes can't be seen, they can be heard, because they hit space and time like drums.
The idea that the universe can make a drum sound comes from Albert Einstein, and many of our thoughts come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this picture, except for those lines that were painted on it.
But if we are free to fall in the universe, even without these guides, our trajectory will draw these lines, because we will find ourselves moving along straight lines, along straight lines that don't bend through the universe.
Einstein also realized that -- this is the most crucial part -- that if you put energy and matter into the universe, the universe bends.
That's Einstein's great broad relativity.
Even the path of light will be bended.
When bending to a certain degree, it turns around the orbit of the sun, like the Earth around the sun, and the moon around the Earth.
This is the curve of nature in the universe.
But Einstein doesn't realize that if you compress the sun into a ball six kilometres in diameter -- that is, you compress a million times the mass of the Earth into a ball six kilometres in diameter -- you create a black hole, which is so dense that if the light was too close to it, it wouldn't be able to escape -- leaving a huge shadow in the universe.
But Einstein always thought the black hole was just a mathematical singularity.
He didn't believe there was a black hole.
He believed that nature would prevent the formation of black holes to protect us.
It took decades to use the term "black holes" and realize that black holes are real objects -- in fact, they are stars of great mass in the state of death after a catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun doesn't collapse into black holes.
It's not really big enough.
But if we did some ideological experiments -- Einstein was very fond of it -- we could imagine crushing the sun within six kilometers, and then putting a little Earth in orbit around it, like 30 kilometers from the black hole sun.
The Earth will glow itself, because now the sun is gone, and we have no other source of light -- so our little planet will have to glow itself.
You'll find that you can even place the Earth in orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole and make it orbit happily.
This black hole is actually about as big as Manhattan.
Before it destroys the Earth, it could swell to Hudson Street.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that's compressed to half the size of Manhattan.
So we moved the Earth closer to the black hole -- 30 kilometers -- and we noticed that it was orbiting around the black hole in perfect orbit.
There are rumours that black holes will devour everything in the universe, but in fact you have to be very close before you actually fall in.
But impressively, from our point of view, we always see the Earth.
It can't hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light coming out of the Earth falls into a black hole, but some of it bends and we see it.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the story of the Fort Galactica, and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun doesn't collapse into a black hole; it's not big enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them devours the galaxy, it'll look like this.
We'll see the shadow of a black hole thrown into the Milky Way with hundreds of billions of stars and the dust belts of stars.
If we fall into this black hole, we'll see the light reflected around the black hole, and we won't even feel that something huge is happening when we begin to enter the shadow.
If we try to start the rocket and get out of there, it won't be good, because we can't escape, and even light can't escape.
Although black holes look dark from the outside, they don't, because all galaxies can fall into black holes with us.
And even so, because of the relativity of time inflation, our clocks seem to be slower than the time of the galaxy, and it looks like the galaxies outside are accelerating, just before we were destroyed by a black hole.
It's like experience of dying, you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a complete experience of death.
You can't tell anyone you saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we've never seen such a shadow of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they can't be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomy picture -- imagine two black holes that have existed together for a long time.
Maybe they used to be stars and then collapsed into two black holes -- each of them 10 times the mass of the sun.
Now we're gonna compress them up to 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times every second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at the speed of light.
In the process, they not only bend space, but also create space vibrations in the tail stream behind you, a real time wave.
When the black hole hits the universe, it squeezes and stretches space.
These vibrations spread in space at the speed of light.
This computer simulation was done by NASA's Gordard relativity group.
It took almost 30 years to solve this problem.
It's one of many groups.
It shows two black holes spinning around each other, these are imaginary curves.
As you can see – it may be a little blurry – you can see a red wave being launched, and these are gravity waves.
They are the sound of a real universe, and these voices will be transmitted from these black holes out at the speed of light as they merge, until the two black holes come together and become a silently spinning black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the crushing and stretching of these spaces.
You really can hear those voices.
Of course, you'll be helpless to find your head squeezed and stretched, so you may not understand what's going on.
But I'd like to play for you the sound of our predictions.
This is my team's research -- a relatively brief calculation model.
Imagine a smaller black hole falling into a larger black hole.
The sound you hear comes from the collision of small mass black holes with space as they approach large mass black holes.
If they're far away, they'll have a very small voice.
But the sound became like a drum hammer knocking on space, causing it to vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what the sound will become.
We know that during the fall, small-quality black holes will become faster and louder.
Eventually, we'll hear the little black hole fall completely into the big black hole.
I've never felt the sound so loud - it's actually magnified here.
When I was at home, I felt a little bit of a discomfort.
Sounds like, ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound that our team simulated.
I'm not here to show you images, because black holes don't leave any useful traces, real space doesn't show you those virtual curves.
But if you hear this sound while you're on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run.
Better get away from that sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they're shaking hard.
And then they'll be one.
The sharp sound is a sign of the black hole's integration - it's a sharp sound when it's over.
This is our prediction of what we're going to see.
Fortunately, we're perfectly safe at the governor's beach.
There's no doubt that two black holes in some part of the universe have been merged.
And it's no doubt that the space around us can also feel these vibrating through a million light years, or from a million years ago, which spread at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But they're so small that we can't hear them.
There are experiments in the world that take a lot of effort to build -- one of which is a LIGO -- that will detect space vibrations at a distance of four kilometers less than one atomic nucleus.
This is a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be exceeded in the coming years -- it will be used to detect spatial vibrations.
Another research project on the universe is about to start in the next 10 years, called LISA.
LISA will see black holes of super-mass -- black holes of millions or billions of times the mass of the sun.
From the images from the Hubble Telescope, we see these two galaxies.
Looks like they're still hugging each other.
They may have a super-black hole of enormous mass at their center.
But they're not static, they're actually integrating.
These two black holes will collide, and their convergence will take billions of years.
So gathering their voices is beyond the reach of our human senses.
But the LISA can see the final stages of two super-mass black holes that began to merge a long time ago, 15 minutes before they did.
This detection is not limited to black holes, but it can be used to detect any major disturbances in the universe - the greatest of which is the Big Bang.
When the word was created, some mocked and said, "Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This short animated film by a friend of mine in Proton Studios shows an outside view of the Big Bang.
We would never really want to do that; we want to be inside the universe, because there's no such thing as being outside the universe.
So imagine you're in the middle of a big explosion.
The universe is everywhere, everything is around you, space is swaying in a disorderly manner.
14 billion years have passed, and that voice is still around us.
Galaxies have evolved, and a group of stars have formed in galaxies, and on a planet, at least one of these planets exists, suitable for living.
Here, we're madly building experiments, making calculations, writing computer codes.
Imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes colliding.
It's been traveling through the air all along.
We didn't even show up here.
It's getting closer - 40,000 years ago, we drew on the walls of the cave.
If the sound we're going to get is from the Big Bang, it sounds like this.
Technically, it's noise.
It's a white noise, a confused bell.
But it's everywhere around us, as long as it's not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it'll be like music to our ears, because the quiet echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe we look forward to.
So in the next few years, we'll be able to raise the volume of this music a little bit, so that the universe can be shown to us in audio.
But if we can detect those earliest moments, it will also take us further from understanding the Big Bang, allowing us to ask some of the most difficult questions, but also the most remote ones.
If we play the universe backwards, we can know that there was a big explosion in the past, and we can even hear its noisy voice, but is our Big Bang the only big explosion in the universe?
I mean, we'd have to ask, have there been any such big explosions before?
Will it ever happen again?
I'd like to say that if we take this question up to the level of rethinking that TED advocates, at least in the last minute, we can ask a few questions that we may never be able to answer.
But we have to ask, "Can our universe be just an episode in a larger history?
Or are we just a branch of a multiverse -- every branch of the universe has experienced its own Big Bang -- maybe some of them have buzzing black holes, maybe not -- maybe some of them have conscious lives, maybe some of them don't exist -- and they don't belong to our past, or to our future, but they're connected to us in some way?
So, we can't help but speculate that if there is a multiverse, there is life in the other branches of this multiverse?
This is life in our multiverse.
Is there any other life in the multiverse, or are they also speculating about our existence, thinking about their own origins?
If that's the case, I can imagine them, like us, doing calculations, writing computer codes, building experimental instruments, trying to detect the faint sound that comes from their origins, and wondering who else is there.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Graduate art exhibition moved into the mall for public goods exhibition - Xinhua Network
In the summer of the cloud graduation season, a rare undergraduate art show began on the weekends.
But it is not in the gallery, nor in the campus, but in the public space of the city of Chai-yang and is open to the public free of charge until August 23rd.
Journalists learned that this 2020 graduate art exhibition collected 50 pieces/groups of work from 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, China Media University and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space was extended from two to six floors and used the lampbox in the building to display the graphics and bake the greatest possible amount of the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
In the midst of the epidemic, this exhibition is particularly important.
"We choose to take the graduation to the cloud to the bottom of the line, and we hope that more people will see young people's exploration and understanding of the world, and that the healing power of art for society and the mind will be amplified."
She revealed that the exhibition was a collection of graduates of several art colleges, from which they selected suitable commercial spaces, in the form of traditional shelf drawings, sculptures, new media devices, interactive drawings, VR landscapes, and the most varied and rich in the years.
Among them, Lee Yunshaw expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a combination of mechanical and manual writings in the "first battle of 2020" ; Liu Jia-hyun explored the themes of "encrypted currency", "credit creation", "trade" through a series of "Sund Money" works in Taifung; and Zhang Jia-yung's "cat forest" and "trading" to Zhao Da-chang were animals often associated with human beings, where young artists could see understanding human and animal relations; and Zhu's "Window of Faith" was a reminder to young people growing up, "when a career came to fruition, remember the simple and sincere."
Among the few graduates of the personal exhibition, there is Li Hyuncai from Tianjin School of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was a little worried about the epidemic and had been tested for nucleic acid three days earlier, with an alcoholic cotton and a test report. "
His work, yesterday, was complicated and had to be personal.
At the same time, he was tasked with helping his classmates repair damaged works.
"Show it until 4:30 a.m. and then fix it. Time is tight, and it's a little sad to forget to take a picture with the work. "
He wants to come to Beijing and see his show when the epidemic becomes more stable.

That morning, Bosonaro, age 65, tweeted a photograph of him wearing sneakers, without masks, sitting at a table with breakfast, smiling face, thumbs up with one hand and a box of hydroxychlorine drugs with the other hand.
He said, "Good morning, everybody! New coronary test: negative."
However, Bosonaro did not indicate when the new coronary virus was tested.
On 5 July, Bosonaro showed signs of new coronary pneumonia, on 6 July he was tested positive for the virus, and on 7 July he announced on television that he was diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia.
On 14 and 21 January, Bosonaro tested the new coronary virus twice, and the results remain positive.
During the isolation, Bosonaro showed his hydroxin on several occasions via social media, saying that hydroxin was very effective for the new coronary pneumonia, that it was well administered, that it was in good health, that it was due to hydroxychlorine, and that Brazilian medical institutions used hydroxin to treat the new coronary pneumonia.
According to Brazilian media reports, to date, 5 cabinet ministers and 10 governors in Brazil have confirmed new coronary pneumonia.
A small Swiss aircraft crashed in the Alps, killing all four of them.
According to the European Union News Agency, on July 25, Swiss police informed the media that a small plane crashed in the Swiss Alps on July 25.
All two Swiss and two Austrians were killed in the accident.
Police in Wallis, southern Switzerland, reportedly stated that a small plane crashed more than 3,000 metres above sea level near the Alps mountain peak in Valais, and that rescue workers had arrived at the crash site and confirmed that all four persons aboard the aircraft had been killed.
Valais police said witnesses called the police at 12.25 p.m. on 25th, saying they saw a small plane crash from the sky.
A few minutes later, witnesses again informed the police that there was smoke coming out of the crash site.
Upon being called by the police, the police quickly coordinated the fire officers, medical and rescue personnel and took the helicopter to the scene of the accident.
When the rescue personnel arrived at the crash site, they found that all four people on board had been killed.
The police verified that the victims in the accident included two Swiss men, aged 50 and 66, and two Austrians, aged 46 and 50.
The police said that they were currently working with the Swiss Transport Safety Investigation Commission to investigate the cause of the crash.
Heavy rains in 33 Chongqing districts, flood yellow and orange alerts - China New Network

According to official CBA news, the CBA Qingdao Quarter is finally meeting the first entry fans today.
On July 31st, the season CBA's final match will be officially resumed for the fans when the field viewers include mobile staff and medical doctors, teachers, public security officers and others who have made a remarkable contribution to society during the epidemic.
As a result of the epidemic, the CBA tournament resumed on June 20, almost five months after a break.
Although there was not much audience for the 26th afternoon, it was clear that there were people applauding, and there were people who were silent.
It's been a long time since the players turned on each other and the fans fought in the courtroom.
In the post-season game, if the fans want to watch the game, they'll have to pay attention to this.
This open-air game is held at the Diamond Stadium of the Qingtao Sports Center (the Qingdao Stadium). The sale of tickets is based on a live online ticket, a live online ticket entry system, and all viewers must be 12 years of age or older and possess a certificate to test for nucleic acid within 48 hours.
50 grand in reward for the sand dam landslide.
On July 26th, Hubei Daily News (journalist Lin Jing), Enshi City announced that Chen Guang, a geological disaster site monitor who had made an important contribution to the early warning of the sand dam slide, had sent him a $50,000 bonus.
At the same time, the members of the entire city are called upon to learn from their dedication, commitment and commitment.
On 21 July, a landslide occurred on the sandy dam in the Mau village of Enshi city, which led to the formation of a lake of Qingjiang, 58-year-old Chen Guang, the first person to warn of this slide.
On the afternoon of 17 July, Chen Gwang learned of the breaking of walls in the villagers' homes and immediately went to the scene.
As soon as he came out of his house, five or six hundred meters, he saw the village highway split four or five centimeters, extending along the road to the cornfield, about 50 meters in length.
Chen is alert. Send photos of the road openings to the country's geological disaster monitor contact group.
Following an on-site inspection and judgement by the relevant officials of the Tanburg Nature Planning Institute, the possibility of a landslide was high, and the decision to evacuate the crowd was taken.
Chen's timely early warning won 36 hours of valuable time for the safe evacuation of 315 families and 1,339 people in the affected areas.
No one was killed or injured in this major geological disaster.

The University of Australia has developed a new drug that is expected to be used to treat the new corona-induced veins - Xinhua Network.
Researchers at the University of Monash, Australia, New Zealand (journalist Chen Woo) on July 26, are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and strokes and hope that it will be used to treat blood vessels that are caused by the new coronary virus.
Researchers have found that an enzyme in a plate accelerates the condensation of the plate before a heart attack or stroke.
As a result, they develop a drug that temporarily inhibits the condensation of the plate, thereby avoiding angiogenesis and preventing heart disease and strokes.
According to researchers, this drug only inhibits the condensation of the plate when there are signs of a heart attack or stroke.
Because studies have shown that similar arterial congestion is one of the leading causes of death among new coronary patients, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the future for the treatment of such patients.
At present, the drug has worked well in animal model trials and researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The results were published in the American journal "Scientific Conversion Medicine".
He was the first audience to enter after the CBA rematch allowed the audience to watch.

More than 6000 five-sided sunglasses, 48 square metres per piece, one round and one round, like a silver sun-to-sun field, reflect the sun to a heating tower at more than 200 metres in the center, generating electricity.
Reporters saw this scene at the Hammy Melting Tower Photothermal Power Plant, a mid-electric project in the town of Chau Lake, Ighu district, Xinjiang city.
" So-called melting tower photothermal power generation is the formation of thermal energy from solar light through mirror reflection into the heating tower, and the conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy through traditional power generation technology ... "
Zhang Yong, Deputy Managing Director of China-Electro-Hami Solar Thermal Power Company, explained that it was designed to be similar to the solar stoves used in rural areas of north-west China, bringing together the sun.
Construction began in October 2017 and the plant was connected by the end of last year, covering 6,600 acres, with a total planned installation of 14,500 sunglasses.
" The greatest advantage of conventional solar power generation technologies is that they can store the accumulators of thermal energy and also generate it at night ... "
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project would allow the generator team to operate continuously and steadily, free of light changes; it would also allow rapid participation in grid peaking based on grid load peak demand.
When fully completed, the project will produce 190 million degrees of annual electricity generation, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal annually, reduce more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, approximately 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a source of clean energy for the local community.
Besides, there's another silver "Sunset Sunflower" in the Stone City Light Volt estate in Hamish City.
Hamif has more than 2,300 acres of solar photovoltaic power, and the 714 power plants that have been built follow the Sun and maintain a 90-degree straight angle between the sun and the PV.
" We use a two-axis tracking PV technology and, through integrated control, all generating equipment will maintain the efficiency of the power generation by adjusting the angle to the Sun ' s altitude ... "
Monge, the station's long section, said that in light-lighted weather conditions, the technology could increase the efficiency of photovoltaics by about 20 per cent over the traditional ones.
In the first half of this year, the power plant has produced more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing local demand for electricity.
The Stone City Photovolt Industrial Park is currently the largest single-body Xinjiang, with the most photovolt industrial demonstration of the type of PV components, with 38 PV-based projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
Electricity generation completed in the first half of the year exceeded 110 million degrees, an increase of 6 per cent over the same period in 2019.
Hamish is one of the best places for solar energy in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is over 6,200 megaJourn per square metre, with around 3,200 full-day sunlight hours.
In recent years, the city has been developing the photovoltaic industry so that it can grow sunflower fields.
Solar power generation of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built, and the city's photovoltaic capacity exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of the year, an increase of about 14 per cent over the previous year.
At the moment, Xinjiang has more than 330 PV stations with a installed capacity of over 10 million kilowatts.
Photovoltaic power is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, replacing more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
The police report the details of the missing female university student tour to Qinghai.
On July 26th, Xinning, the news came to the attention of the online community about the "lost connection of a college girl on a tour to Qinglewood."
On 26th, the Public Security Bureau of the Tibetan Autonomous District of Gemu, Haisy, Qinghai Province, informed that Huang was still in a state of disconnection and that many police officers were actively pursuing search work along Huang's lost territory.
On 10 July 2020, the Security Division of the Public Security Department of Galmu City, Heshi State, was informed by their superiors that a student from a university in Nanjing, Huang Cho, had been travelling on Z164 from Nanjing to Galmu on 5 July, and that on 9 July he had lost access to a machine in Sonan Daj, south-west of the Qing Shua River, Tsumalai Autonomous District of Yukhi, Qinghai Province, and requested assistance in his search.
According to the investigation conducted by the Gaelming City Public Security Bureau, Huang Tsai entered Qinghai province on 6 July at 1954 hours and arrived in the city of Galmu at 0400 hours on 7 July.
On the same day, at 0800 hours, one of the lost members of the group left for the G109 State Road by way of the Yellow River Hotel in Galmu City and arrived at 1200 hours at the guard station in Côte d ' Ivoire, the taxi driver returned alone, and at 1500 hours on the same day he arrived in the area of the clear water area near the Sonan Darje protection station, which was closed until 1800 hours on 9 September.
In a further investigation, the police found that on 13 July, at 1707 hours, Huang was passing through the Naikie checkpoint.
Since the Natra checkpoint in the Tibet Autonomous Region, which was set up at the South Mountain Pass in the city of Germín without video surveillance, is unable to locate the person and the vehicle in which he was travelling, the police have to conduct a search along the road and coordinate the discovery of Huang Yai at the various checkpoints along Tibet's way and immediately contact the Gagín City Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest, on 26 July, at 1 a.m., the Gaelmu City Public Security Department organized rescue forces to carry out a search at the Frozen Spring protection station along the Qingchu road, Sonandaje protection station, and actively contacted Sichuan police, Tibetan police, Nanjing police, working together, and the search and rescue work is continuing.
The local police are hoping that a wide range of netizens and members of society will provide timely information to the Galmu police and the Nanjing Gangning police in an effort to locate the missing person.
At the same time, the experts suggest that tourists should behave, rationally, civilizedly, keep an eye on roadside warning signs, do not venture into no-man's-man's-land, encounter an emergency, and report to the police in a timely manner.
The American media revealed the unprovoked demand that China shut down the Consulate General in Houston - China's new network.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Zhu Yan Jing, Author: Zhu Yan Jing
The American press has revealed the unprovoked demand that China shut down the Consulate General in Houston.
On 24 January, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the United States Embassy in China that the Chinese side had decided to withdraw its authorization for the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and had made a specific request that the Consulate General cease all operations and activities, as a counter-measure to the US ' s sudden request to close the Consulate General in Houston on 21 December.
The U.S. government's action has attracted attention and political motivations have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why should China shut down the Consulate General?
According to various media sources, it is not clear why the United States would choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the media put it bluntly: for the election.
CNN reported on 23 March that the American request to close China's Consulate General in Houston raised questions about its political motivation.
According to the article, the United States government's catastrophic response to the New Crown outbreak has resulted in President Trump's low opinion rate in the run-up to the election.
White House officials have privately claimed that China's hard-line strategy was designed to save Trump's support rate and to divert the White House's responsibility for the failure of the outbreak.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States Government for "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of a major conflict".
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that, at a time when the United States economy has been severely hit by the epidemic in the run-up to the United States election season, Trump believes that playing the Chinese card has a political advantage.
The current state of affairs is "a spiral-up, a war against each other", driven in part by the United States Government's domestic considerations, which only exacerbates tensions between China and the United States.
CBS reports that the prospect of Trump's re-election has been strained by the outbreak, which has repeatedly accused China.
There's almost every day a new act in the United States against the absurdity of Trump's so-called "China exploits America".
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing a link between the two countries."
According to the Associated Press, the demand by the United States that China close its Consulate General in Houston has increased tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the south of the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do United States citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret that the United States had asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, stating that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to the Associated Press, this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy magazine website considers this move to be part of a series of provocative initiatives that will only worsen US-China relations."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an East Asia expert at the American think tank Brookings Institution, as saying that since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of anything to compare with the United States operation against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
According to Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, this move was unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
According to analysts, this move could cause persistent damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 as the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China has an embassy and five general consulates in the United States.

In his speech at the parade, Putin said that the state of modern technology of the Russian Navy's equipment had continued to rise in recent years, and that in 2020 the Russian Navy would receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with a unique high-speed ultrasound system.
In addition, the Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief, Yevmenov, said in an interview with the Russian Ministry of Defence agency Red Star that the Russian plans for the construction of ships had been effectively implemented and that the number of new vessels to be received by the Russian Navy in 2020 had been larger in recent years.
In 1696, the tsar, Peter, began to form a fleet of marines, opening up the history of the Russian Navy.
The last Sunday of July every year is Russian Navy Day.
Since 17 July, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have been actively involved in the prevention and control of the epidemic, in response to the call of the General Union of the Autonomous Communities.
North and South Tianshan trade union cadres, employees, workers, model workers, walk into the streets, among the population, carrying out activities such as delivery of food and medicine, disinfection, promotion of awareness of the disease, service to the public, and practical action to highlight the union's "hard nuclear power".
In recent days, a group of condolence groups from the General Trade Union of Tianmachi City of Urumqi sent a much-needed supply of disease-control and life supplies to staff at 12 isolation points.
After the outbreak, Tianshan invested more than 1.05 million yuan in the first time and was allocated, as a matter of urgency, to 23 trade unions directly at the grass-roots level.
Deputy Secretary-General of the China Xinjiang Construction and Construction Commission, Trade Union President Zhao Sang-chung, after receiving the company's notification of the outbreak, offered to stay on duty to protect his employees.
He sends cookers, food and daily supplies to the employees living in the unit dormitories and newly employed workers, and organises the delivery of essential supplies to them every two days.
"On 21 July, a survey was carried out of the cadres who were on the front line of the epidemic and conducted a line-by-line and door-to-door process involving the first-line population of 704 workers in the Urumqi area to supplement the purchase of vaccination supplies and household goods. "
The leaders of the Xinjiang Transport and Communications Union have told journalists that they are fully committed to the prevention and control of the epidemic, are steadily advancing the development of transport and are creating a climate of solidarity in the fight against the disease.
It's hot in the summer, and trade unions at all levels focus on the first-line workers in the area where the epidemic is being controlled, and they're taking care of it.
On 19 July, the Urumqi District General Trade Union launched a "Cool" condolences campaign to the first line of the epidemic. The county police station, the card points and the health system received condolences such as beverages, fruits, etc.
"Trade union cadres need to further strengthen their political positions, strengthen their responsibilities, take care of the warmth of the people, and encourage their commitment to action.
Trade union organizations must play their role in bringing workers together, providing protection against the epidemic, actively defending the health and well-being of workers, and bringing care to the first-line workers. "
The head of the Central Trade Union of the Autonomous Region said:
Full roll-out of Direct Recruitment Officers in 2020 - Xinhua Network
On July 26th, July 26th, Xinhua (journalist Jaikilon) the Political Work Department of the Military Commission and the Defence Mobilization Department of the Military Commission have recently issued a joint announcement to deploy a direct intake of non-commissioned officers from general higher education graduates in 2020.
This year's Direct Recruitment Officer covers more than 270 military field generalizations in 64 categories, including computers, automation, machinery, with a focus on increasing the intake of drones, navigation, aerospace, electronics, small languages, etc., which is nearly 2,000 more than last year.
This year, the job of a non-commissioned officer coincides with the recruitment of conscripts, which began on 1 August and ends on 30 September.
Young conscripts can consult the National Recruitment Network (http://www.gfbzb.gov.cn) about the conditions for direct recruitment of candidates and the distribution of admissions among the various regions, the online submission of registrations in accordance with the professional range and conditions of admission, and follow-up admissions such as medical examinations, political examinations, etc., in accordance with the uniform requirements of the military service authorities of the place of recruitment.
Qualified young people who have been unable to be recruited as non-commissioned officers due to professional and planned restrictions may be recruited for compulsory recruitment, and the number of years of schooling in the regular higher education system is considered the same as the length of service at the end of compulsory military service.
This year, the recruitment of non-commissioned officers is organized in a unified manner by the people ' s recruitment offices of provincial or municipal governments.
In accordance with the routine control requirements of the epidemic, this year's direct recruiter does not, in principle, arrange to report himself to the battalion, which will be organized in parallel with the conscripts.
The direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers will begin on 1 September 2020 and the Force will issue a non-commissioned officer order on 1 December 2020.
The receiving units of the Force will develop scientific recruitment and professional training programmes and organize them in a serious manner; once the training is completed, the recruitment of non-commissioned officers will be consistently and accurately assigned to the technical and technical posts of their counterparts, in accordance with the principle of consistency between the professional counterparts.
Spokesperson at the Embassy in the United Kingdom: Chinese Government is a firm defender of cyber security - China New Network
On July 26, the Chinese Embassy's website reported that on July 25, the spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom responded to journalists about the wrong statements about the cyber attack.
He stressed that the Chinese Government was a firm defender of cyber security and had always been firmly opposed and opposed to any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
Questions were asked by journalists: according to the media, a Chinese-related hacker organization interfered with the network system of a British company, attacked British-American technology companies with proprietary data, and invaded the European Union government network.
The Chinese Government is a firm defender of cyber security and has always been firmly opposed and opposed to any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, retrogressive and diverse in its range of actors, and there should be sufficient evidence when investigating and characterizing cyber incidents, and there can be no unwarranted speculation.
The speaker said that past events such as Prism Gate had proved that the United States had been conducting the largest worldwide cyber-smuggling operation.
It is in the common interest of all States to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
He noted that China's achievements in science, technology and innovation were not stolen, not stolen, but rather fought hard through self-reliance.
In 2019, China submitted approximately 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) channel, with an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a major innovation and intellectual property power.
Data from the Central Branch of the People ' s Bank of China, Urumqi, show that in the first half of the year, new loans to Xinjiang farmers and micro-enterprises increased over the full year of 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People ' s Bank used a variety of monetary policy instruments to guide the banking sector to increase lending and provide adequate financial support for disease control and rehabilitation.
Most of the Urumqi free nucleic acid tests are almost complete, with a second test in high-risk areas - the new network.
Zhang Wei, Director of the Urumqi Health and Safety Commission of the City of Urumqi, reported on July 26, China News Network Urumqi (journalist Sun Tinven Zhao Yamin) that at present, most of the Urumqi city's free nucleic acid tests are almost complete.
Experts from the Department of State and the Autonomous Region, experts from the city of Urumqi, are further assessing the development of the epidemic on the basis of the results of nucleic acid tests and epidemiological surveys.
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Press Office held a press conference on the Xinjiang epidemic and the situation.
According to him, between 0000 and 2400 hours on 25 July there were 22 new confirmed cases of coronary pneumonia in the city of Urumqi (of which 5 were referred for confirmed cases of non-symptomatic infections) and 38 new cases of non-symptomatic infections.
As at 2400 hours on 25 July, 135 cases had been diagnosed in the city of Urumqi and 147 cases were infected with no symptoms.
The new non-symptomatic infections on the 25th were also screened largely through free city-wide nucleic acid tests.
According to Urumqi Health Commissioner Zhang Wei on 26th day, most of Urumqi's free nucleic acid testing has been largely completed.
He added that, in the experience of other parts of the country, there were a number of factors affecting the results of nucleic acid tests, such as the sensitivity of the test agent, the time of infection and detoxification of the person being tested, the co-operation of the person being tested at the time the specimen was taken (the difference in the degree of cooperation may have resulted in the absence of the specimen) and the detection of the environment, and the operational proficiency of the test personnel.
For a variety of reasons, nucleic acid testing can also result in pseudonegative results.
False negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the results of the nucleic acid test are negative.
In addition, persons suspected of having been in close contact with confirmed cases usually require two nucleic acid tests to remove them.
For those who have been to high-risk areas of the epidemic, two tests of nucleic acid are also required to exclude the possibility of a negative nucleic acid test if hemorrhaging and respiratory symptoms occur.
In view of the above, and in the interest of the health of the entire population of the city, the city of Urumqi will, as of today, conduct a second free nucleic acid test in priority areas such as Tianshan, Shaybak district, along with a "recovery".
According to the information received, the Shaybak district in Tianshan is a high-risk area.
The Shanghai International Film Festival revealed extraordinary industrial confidence - a new network.
2020-07-26 06:52:39 Source: Written report Author: Wang Seok-seok Responsible Editor: Wang Seok-seok
Underline, the clouds are hot, and the Shanghai International Film Festival has revealed extraordinary industry confidence.
Yesterday, the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival 2020, organized in the context of strict vaccination measures, opened the scene of the twenty-third Shanghai International Film Festival with an industry summit entitled "All-round to build a new era".
This year ' s Shanghai International Film Festival is significant as the first international video festival since the continued spread of the global epidemic and the normalization of our epidemic prevention and control.
The Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is a sign of confidence, and a sign of determination, based on good disease prevention and regularization -- our confidence in the fight against the epidemic, our confidence in the people ' s festival, our global video and creative centres, and our confidence in the Shanghai Cultural brand.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with its innovative and progressive posture, is a fresh start.
As a result, every step needs to be taken to serve the public spirituality of the population and to serve the quality of the development of the film industry.
Especially this year.
In order to cherish the hard-won epidemic control situation, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly enforced the disease prevention and control requirements, and, on the other hand, launched a multi-boarding of activities along the lines of creating intelligence for Chinese films to meet the needs of the movie obscurantism.
On the first day of the opening, from the bottom of the line to the Industrial Forum, film festival-related activities were strictly implemented in the context of the prevention policy.
The forum activity is controlled by 50 people, separated from each viewing room, with a strict control rate of 30%.
As the Film Festival Organizing Committee held, "the safety of people's lives and physical well-being first" is a prerequisite.
Underline activity has been significantly reduced, and the clouds have been a lot of fun.
To implement the important idea of "People's cities, people's cities, people's cities, people's cities" as a festival of the people, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival has been innovative, transformative, using initiatives like the online cloud show and the master Ben Cloud Sharing to meet the diverse needs of fans.
On the first day of the opening, the film festival's official partner, Ming-Chu, and the East Myeong-Chu, each of them, will have multiple "twilights" and "twilights" back to the fans.
That evening, the Golden Lord's Open Forum and Master Jasquawk Ben were also video-taught, learning from powerful countries and many platforms such as Mangai App, so that people could watch the latest developments in Chinese films.
Yesterday, at the inaugural forum, the Deputy Director-General and member of the Central Radio and Television General Group made a statement and opened the film festival, the Shanghai City Council Standing Committee, the Minister of Information, Zhou Huilin, and the Deputy Mayor attended.
White House outbreak expert Fouche: Cautionary optimism about the vaccine being developed in early 2021.
Fouche 25 made this statement at a video conference on the Internet organized by the International Leadership Foundation.
He warned that it was not clear how the new coronary outbreak would develop in the autumn and winter, or what its ultimate impact would be, and that the only way to end it was for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, the number of new crown confirmed cases in the United States had reached 4.176,000 and 146,000 deaths by the time of the twenty-first century.
Foxy says that some parts of the United States are struggling to fight the rebound.
Although epidemics vary from place to place and require tailored responses, a diversified anti-prevalence strategy does not mean that there is no close link between regions.
The outbreak in one region will eventually affect the rest of the world.
"This is not the time for complacency," said Fouche, "Our work is not complete, we must intensify our efforts, and we must remain vigilant to the uncertainty of the future."
American Chinese medical expert, founder of the AIDS cocktail therapy program, said at the conference that America's new coronary epidemic had not yet reached its peak.
"Every one of us must do our part to slow down the spread of the virus. "
The public is called upon to use its own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the development of new crown therapy drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting international exchanges between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region, working to upgrade the status of the American Asian-Pacific community and foster international youth leaders.
On the same day, U.S. Secretary of Transport Zhao Xiao Lan, U.S. Congressman Monghuwen and President of the International Leadership Foundation, Dong Ji Ling, addressed the conference.
They paid special tribute to Asia-Pacific medical workers and volunteers on the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to immunization norms such as "social distance" in order to contain the spread of the epidemic.
Dalian: No new local confirmed cases of coronary pneumonia 24 new cases of non-symptomatic infections - Xinhua Network
On July 25, the news came out on the 25th of the city of Dalian. Between 1500 and 1400 hours on July 24th, there were no new confirmed cases of coronary pneumonia in Dalian City, 24 new cases of non-symptomatic infections and no new suspected cases.
Between 22 and 1400 hours on 22 and 25 July, 12 confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia were reported locally throughout the city, all of which were treated centrally in isolation at the 6th People ' s Hospital in Dalian City.
According to Zhao Company, Deputy Director of the Health and Health Commission of Dalian City, in the light of the epidemic, Dalian City organized the presence of medical staff from the third-level hospital throughout the city in street communities, opened more than 600 sampling sites in Dalian Bay, workers ' villages, along the light track and in some of the priority areas of the new district of Kimp, and made every effort to promote the screening of personnel for nucleic acids, with nearly 2,000 medical personnel taking samples of nucleic acids per day.
As of 1400 hours on 25 July, the city as a whole had taken more than 210,000 samples.
Ten out of 12 confirmed cases in Dalian City are employees of Dalian Kaye World Seafood Co. Ltd.; 46 out of 54 cases of non-asymptomatic infections are employees of the company and relatives of their relatives; and 85 per cent of all positive cases of nucleic acid testing are attributed to employees of the enterprise and relatives of their relatives.
As a result of the study, Dalian City decided to tighten strict controls on close contacts with all employees of Dalian Kaye World Seafood Corporation, as well as close contacts with those in close contact, and to implement 14 days of centralized quarantine medical observation, with at least two tests of nucleic acid.
At the same time, the city of Dalian decided to further expand the scope of the centralized quarantine medical observers, with 14 days of centralized medical observation and at least 2 tests of nucleic acid for those in close contact with the nucleic acid test positives, both with cases and without symptoms of infection.
At Dalian Airport, on 25th day, a circular was issued that the entire city ' s personnel were in principle not bound by necessity, but required to be separated, with proof of the negativeness of the detection of nucleic acid within seven days; the bus terminal of Dalian was suspended from 1200 hours on 25th, with the date of recovery to be notified.
Brazilian studies show that hydroxin is ineffective in treating new coronary pneumonia for mild moderate disease - a new mesonet.
In recent days, a Brazilian study has shown that hydroxin is not effective for new coronary pneumonia patients with mild moderate disease.
The study was published in New England Journal of Medicine.
Researchers in Pakistan have conducted clinical trials in three groups of 667 patients in 55 hospitals across the country; the main objective is to analyse whether this has helped to improve the condition of patients with mild and moderate coronary pneumonia, compared to the treatment of hydroxin alone or in conjunction with other antibiotics.
The results show that not only is hydroxychloroquine untreated, but it can have damaging side effects on organs.
The study was carried out by several authoritative hospitals in Brazil, such as the Hopital Israelita Albert Einstein Hospital, the HCor Hospital for Heart Disease, the Syrian Lebanese Hospital, and others, in collaboration with the Brazilian Clinical Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Network for Serious Care Research (BRICNet).
On the 25th of local time, Brazilian President Bossonaro announced the results of the fourth nucleic acid test on social platforms as negative.
During the infection, Bosonaro was on hydroxin and was actively promoted on several occasions.

On the 25th, the Festival of the Red Tourism Festival 2020 and the First Red Cultural Industry Fair opened in Changshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry is also faced with a small number of young people, homogeneity of tour projects, single channels of commercialization, etc.
In particular, this year's epidemic has been a major setback for the country's literary industry and serious challenges for the red tourist attractions.
For example, the use of technology such as drone filming, VR bathing experience can meet the visitors' need for "unattendance and arrival" tours; the introduction of live webcasts to promote the famous eugenics in the red scenery can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of "cloud" technology, the creation of theme-oriented, well-oriented and well-intentioned fine displays, and the full display and enhancement of the teaching function in the red scenery; and the innovative dissemination of red culture to "live " revolutionary relics, to make red tourism popular, to pass on the red scene and to raise the attractiveness of red scenery sites.
This cultural festival, which is popular at the time of the festival, is based on the introduction of the Red Library specialty using 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and intelligent city demonstrations, as well as on the promotion of red-language attractions, as an attempt to put smart wings on red tourism, with the expectation that the Hunan Red tourism is getting hotter.
The U.S.-China trade negotiators are meeting in August.
Hong Kong's South China Morning News, 25, quoted an anonymous source who reported that trade representatives Rae Hae-chul, the head of the Chinese trade negotiation team, and the co-leader of the US team, Liu Tsun, Vice-Minister of State, and trade representatives, are expected to meet formally in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States.
It has been reported that while China has significantly increased its purchases of American agricultural products over the past few months, China still has a distance from the commitments made in the trade agreement due to, among other things, the New Crown Virus outbreak.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other's consulates in the United States and other disputes could undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States, which entered into force one month after its signature on 15 January, provides for a six-monthly meeting of a high-level trade framework group from both sides.
According to the source, this meeting will be an "an important turning point" for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
But the same person said that if US-China tensions led to less willingness to talk at this time, the two sides might agree that the teleconference of May 8 between Hae-chul and Liu Tsuruo had met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of the year, relations between China and the United States have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes over the origins of the New Crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
The President of the United States, Trump, boasted at the beginning of the year about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, but his attitude has recently changed.
At the White House press conference, he said that although China had recently purchased a record number of American corn and bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade deal means less to me now than it was when it was made."
An anonymous Beijing government consultant has also argued that due to poor US-China relations, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place and that "trade issues have lost their weight in US-China relations".
But he revealed that China's economic and trade-related units still met on the 23rd day to discuss a number of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We've tried to buy them, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jinning, Vice-President of the United States-China Trade Commission, said it was "more important than ever" to keep the initial phase of the deal alive, and that China had made progress this year in further opening its financial markets to American companies.
The Plenum analyst at the independent research company said, "It's better to talk than not, though it might be a matter of routine."
On 26 July in Beijing, a reporter from Xinhua News Agency (journalist Wei Yukun) was informed by the Ministry of Emergency Management that the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the National Food and Material Reserve Agency, would urgently re-route 1.35 million knitted bags, 1.2 million square metres of rags, 130,000 square metres of rags, etc., to Anhu's six types of central reserves of anti-flood rescues.
According to the responsible head of the Department of Emergency Management, the Yangtze River basin is currently experiencing high water level fluctuations in mid-downstream, and the Yangtze River Flood No. 3 of 202026 is forming upstream of the Yangtze River, increasing local risk.
The meteorological services expect heavy rainfall in the centre and downstream of the Yangtze River in Guizhou in the next three days.
It was described that since the invasion, the Ministry of Emergency Management had deployed a national integrated fire rescue unit to pre-position a specialized rescue force in priority areas, participating in a total of 10,064 rescues against floods, more than 130,000 firefighters, 17,778 fire trucks, 11887 boats, 37777 people in distress, and 107,000 people evacuated and transferred.
Chief Representative of the China District of NASDAQ, Xianxiang: It's now the best time node for Chinese companies to travel to the United States of America - Economic Watch - Professional Financial News.
Economic Watch, Zhang Bin, journalist, the U.S. market has imposed more stringent controls on the medium-size stock due to the successful coffee fraud, combined with long-term pressure on valuation, pressure on the medium-sized stock market in the U.S., the Internet, and the recent opening of the Chinese-sized stock market in Kyoto.
And recently, the Shell, Idea Motors and others have gone to the United States with a high level of enthusiasm.
Is this the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States in the midst of the epidemic and the Sino-China crisis?
" As far as the recent IPO case and the companies that are going to go to the United States are concerned, IPO is essentially unaffected, but the market is now very good, and even now this is the best time point for Chinese companies to go to the United States of America in the last 10 years. "
The Chief Representative of the China District of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange said at the Snowball Summit of Leaders of Listed Companies in 2020, that he would be the leader of the World Bank.
In April this year, the United States Securities Commission (SEC) and the United States Public Company Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued a "Statement on the Critical Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information - A Discussion on the Current Challenges of Access to Information by United States Listed Companies with Substantial Operations in China".
This statement indicates that, despite the significant increase in international cooperation and coordination in recent years, United States regulators continue to face problems with access to information, and that SEC and PCAOB continue to face legal and practical challenges; in contrast to this document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies facing audit obstacles and their auditing institutions, with a large number of equity firms listed.
In addition, in May this year, the Senate of the United States Congress passed the Foreign Corporate Accountability Act, which introduced additional disclosure requirements for foreign companies to be listed in the United States.
It seems that the medium-size crisis has not affected the appetite of investors.
"When this news first came out, everyone was asking if they could go to the U.S., but then we found that these problems were not a problem on the investor's side, and that investors might ask these questions and even become a standardization issue on their recent IPO tour, but that was not seen as an important factor for investors not to vote in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that you look at the current situation as usual.
This, of course, may appear to have been the worst in the last two years, but in terms of investors' appetite, it has not been affected in any way.
So the next wave of IPOs will continue from now until the end of this year or before the American elections. "
On May 9th of this year, Kim Shanyun was officially listed in NASDAQ in the United States as the first Chinese enterprise to travel to the United States of America after the outbreak.
"Kin Shan Yun's listing gives the Chinese company behind the IPO a great deal of confidence. "
It's a sign.
(b) In terms of total initial fund-raising, 20 enterprises raised $2.725 billion, up by more than 52.4 per cent from the same period last year;
According to Xiong-seong, Chinese companies that traveled to the IPOs in the first half of this year are of high quality, with hard fundamentals and high-quality companies that have grown up, and are more favoured by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, he continues to be optimistic about Ming China's IPO.
"In the short term, the rush to the IPOs continues; in the medium term, the Chinese companies have more options. A shares, Hong Kong shares, United States shares, all will consider the U.S. general elections and US-China relations as factors of market choice and timing; in the long run, everything will return to normal, with market fluctuations being cycles, both political and economic, and eventually to normal, with the stock market always moving ahead with volatility. "
At the same time, he said, "There are a lot of uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that can be seen by investors, other factors are relatively minor, and investors need to invest in good Chinese companies."

That evening's concert was opened in the sound of the piano bell at the beginning of "Ra-two", which was the first time that the National Theatre's "Sounds like Summer Flower" concert was dedicated to the audience.
Zhang Xiaoqiao, with his deep understanding, has developed the first theme of his work, which is full of sorrow and disquiet. Under Yang's command, the orchestra and the piano create an endless hearing and enjoyment in a race and compromise.
After the second act of "silentness" and the third of the great carnivals, hundreds of viewers gave a big round of applause, and online viewers gave their heartfelt praises in the form of curtains and comments.
Then Zhang Xiaotao gave back to the audience with a song from Shaw Bang.
After a brief stage change, Yang directed the National Theatre Orchestra to play the last of the large orchestras by Rachmaninov, "Symphony Dance" , in which the composer presented a more introspective emotion and incorporated his new inspiration and memory of the past.
In Yang Yang's calm and calm treatment, the sad and rising atmosphere of this work has spread, and the Rakhmaninov's last spark has been derelict.
The pre-audience section of this concert once again brings an unexpected surprise to the audience.
The news anchor just came to the back of the National Theatre's dressing room to reveal the "place" in front of the masters of Tejeev, Lang Lang, and then went to the public space of the National Theatre, where he quickly engaged in a conversation with Yang Yang, Zhang Xiaoe and the National Theatre's tuner in front of the three nine-foot pianos with stories. He just discussed with them the maintenance and maintenance of the piano in the eyes of a senior piano lover, the music of Rahmaninov, the life of musicians in peacetime and the preparation for the show, and at the end of the presentation, he just worked with Zhang Xiaoqing's "Shuman" dream song to make the eyes full.
That night, at the National Theatre's Tahouk Open Theatre, the military song was so bright that the military brigade singing music would begin in the loud and open "Don't forget the beginning."
It's the first show since the National Theatre's "Tai Lak" concert.
According to the information received, on August 1st, the commander Zheng Jian will also continue to bring to the National Theatre Choir the "Soldiers and Motherland" - the National Theatre to celebrate the 8th Military Festival concert as a show on the line of the "Sunflowers" series, broadcast live on the Internet, and pay tribute to the warriors defending the homeland in their classic songs.

People ' s Daily Journal commentator: Focus on managing your own business and building new advantages for future development — learning to follow up on the important speech made by General Secretary Xi Jinping at the Entrepreneurs ' Symposium — Xinhua Network
Xinhua News, Beijing, July 25, The People's Daily, July 26, commentator's article: Focusing on your own business, building new advantages for future development
Currently, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain acute and complex, and the challenges to our development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic strength, building confidence in winning, and concentrating on doing our job is the key to addressing our risk challenges.
At the recent entrepreneurial colloquium, General Secretary Xi stressed that, in the current external environment of increased protectionism, a depressed world economy and a shrinking global market, we must concentrate on doing our part, taking full advantage of domestic super-large market advantages, moving towards a new development paradigm dominated by large domestic and international cycles that are mutually reinforcing, raising the level of modernization of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promoting scientific and technological innovation, accelerating key core technological challenges and shaping new future development advantages.
The mind of the perspicuous, the master of power wins.
In an external environment in which economic globalization is deepening, markets and resources "outside" play an important role in the country's rapid development.
Now, the world is undergoing profound change in the impact of the epidemic, facing additional uncertainties and uncertainties, and economic globalization is being reversed and reversed.
One of the most important aspects of preparing and working for a longer period of time to cope with changes in the external environment, which will drive our economy to take a long and steady course, is to use the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as a strategic basis for development, to take full advantage of its strengths and to give impetus to our economic development and to the recovery of the world economy through a booming domestic economy and the opening up of the domestic cycle.
We need to be profoundly aware of the importance of building a complete domestic demand system for our long-term development and long-term security.
The Party's Central Review has clearly articulated a strategy for the expansion of domestic demand, which is needed to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to sustain the long-term and healthy development of the country's economy and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of big economies is internal recyclability.
With the world ' s most complete and largest industrial system, strong productive capacity, well-developed complementary capacities, over 100 million market owners and more than 170 million highly educated or skilled people, and a vast domestic demand market of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, we are in the midst of a new industrialization, informationization, urbanization and rapid development of agriculture, with great potential for investment.
Public ownership is the dominant, multi-ownership economic development, the distribution of labour, the coexistence of different forms of distribution, and the socialist basic economic systems, such as the socialist market economy system, which stimulates the dynamism of various types of market subjects, liberates and develops social productivity, promotes efficiency and equitable organic unity and sustains common prosperity.
We need to firmly grasp the strategic basis for expanding domestic demand, making production, distribution and circulation more dependent on domestic markets for a virtuous circle, defining the strategic direction of supply-side structural reforms, and promoting a dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at higher levels.
To accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, to vigorously promote science, technology and innovation and other aspects of innovation, to accelerate the advancement of strategic and emerging industries such as the digital economy, smart manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, to create new growth points, poles of growth, and to evolve a new development paradigm dominated by large domestic and international cycles that are mutually reinforcing.
Openness leads to progress, and closure is bound to lag behind.
General Xi has repeatedly stressed that the doors open in China will not be closed, but will only be opened more and more.
Focusing on large domestic cycles is by no means a closed door, but rather a stronger and more sustainable development by harnessing the domestic demand potential to better connect domestic and international markets, making better use of both international and domestic markets, and both resources.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and expanding openness, and the smoother the internal cycle, the more conducive it is to creating a new pattern of openness and to creating new advantages for participation in international cooperation and competition.
Despite the current rise in protectionist thinking at the international level, we stand on the right side of history by insisting on deepening reforms, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting an open world economy and building a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has been through many tribulations in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, growing up in it and rising up from it.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the Party Centre, with Comrade Xi at its core, the remarkable strength of the Chinese socialist system, the strong mobilization capacity and the strength of the combined power, the unity of all the nation's entire ranks, we will be able to overcome all the difficult and difficult obstacles, maintain the momentum for the country's economic and social development, fully build a small and prosperous society and successfully begin a new journey towards the full construction of a modern socialist State!
The balance gains went down after 90 instead of "retributive" savings?
As the balance gains went down, instead of running away from the balance, the "retribution" started saving money?
According to the Report on Saving after Balance 90, published by the China Institute of New Economic Studies in the days before the joint payment, in the first half of the year, after 90, it was more like saving money: per capita savings were nearly 40% higher than in 2019.
Interestingly, "after 90" tends to start with a pen of small money, 60% of which averages less than $20.
Saving money with the balance is also a "90s" habit of saving money.
According to the data, of the 700 million surplus users, 134 million are "after 90" .
China has 174 million "after 90", which means about three out of every four "after 90" in China are saving money with the balance.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of the IMF, such as the surplus, has fallen from above 2 per cent at the beginning of the year to about 1.5 per cent.
Even so, it doesn't affect the pace of saving after 90.
And in the context of the increase in the surplus savings effect, a lot of young people who are used to the surplus are turning directly into "Kimmin".
As of July 13th, the new "Kimmin" on the proceeds had more than doubled over the previous month, and more and more young people were making progress in paying for the treasure.
According to analysts, the flow of funds from surplus to stock markets was also an important reason for the clear decline in the IMF share in June.
The report also shows that "after 90" girls tend to save more, on average 20% more money than boys; 60% of users holding funds on the payment platform are men, and women tend to choose a more robust approach to financial management than men.
What's the plan after 90?
The payment data show that after 90s there's a habit of targeting money, and travel is the biggest user of the money.
As a result of the epidemic, many of the "90s" have saved money to prepare for post-empire travel; cinemas have resumed operations and have provided new avenues for moving from savings to consumption.

France ' s military input into space -- Xinhua Network
The French Minister of Defence, Florence Palley, on 24th, said that France would add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defence budget and develop a military force in space in order to guard against the "unfriendly act " that might be carried out by other countries in outer space.
Palley told the newspaper Provence that between 2019 and 2025, the expenditure budget for the French military space project would increase from the Euro3.6 billion (approximately US$ 4.2 billion) previously proposed to Euro4.3 billion (US$5 billion).
Under the French Military Planning Act for the period 2019-2025, which was approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation and communication satellites, launch three electromagnetic interception satellites and upgrade its space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Marlon announced last July that a military command for space and an aviation and space force would be established within the French Air Force.
Palley said she would officially announce the formation of this space force when she visited a military school in Salon, Provence.
Paley says this space force is part of the Air Force, with 500 men by 2025.
She said, "The idea that space served the common good of science is gone. Space is now a place where nations compete for global hegemony."
Pali reiterated Marklon's previous statement that the French had no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are not in any way engaged in an arms race... but it is my duty to fully understand the threat we may face... "
Palley re-states the surveillance of a French-Italian military satellite in 2017.
She said, "Peave." It's a Russian satellite.
The Russians deny that.
Paley said that France "will soon" will have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and locking in the back of those unfriendly moves.
According to the French media, France's quest for a space force stems from the request made last February by United States President Donald Trump to the United States Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a Tai Chi Air Force.
Trump signed the Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the creation of the sixth-largest United States army, the Air Force.
Some experts are concerned that these U.S. initiatives have accelerated the militarization of U.S. space and could trigger a new arms race in space.

The shared accommodation market has been reported to be heating-up since March.
According to the China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020 (hereinafter referred to as "the Report" ), released by the National Information Centre of the present newspaper (journalist Yang Chae Qui), which shares the economic research centre, the volume of our shared accommodation market transactions fell by 72.1 per cent in the first five months of 2020.
However, the shared accommodation market has warmed up since March, with a gradual recovery in market turnover, order volumes and reception numbers.
According to the Report, there has been a significant decline in transactions in the shared accommodation market, owing, on the one hand, to a sharp decline in demand for controlled travel accommodation, a sharp decline in the volume of orders, a 65 per cent decline in the total number of orders over the previous five months and a 63 per cent decline in the number of recipients over the same period; on the other hand, weak demand has also led to a more marked decline in overnight prices, with the average night price for the previous five months falling by 16 per cent over the same period.
However, market turnover increased by 78 per cent, 199 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively, in March and April; orders rose by 141 per cent, 152 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively; and host populations increased by 81 per cent, 112 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively.
According to the report, the shared accommodation industry has developed well in the long term, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In response, the Deputy Director of the National Information Centre for the Sharing of Economic Research Centre said to workers' daily journalists in Fengxia that the development of shared accommodation requires stronger policy support, on the one hand, better policy advocacy and a better business environment, on the one hand, and greater policy direction and support, on the other hand, in terms of stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism accommodation services, innovative service approaches and strengthening government cooperation with platform enterprises, on the other.

On July 26th, China's famous centre for vascular surgery - the Shanghai Long Sea Hospital of the Naval Medical University - signed a contract with the Shanghai Hospital for vascular surgery, affiliated with Xiamen University, to establish a collaborative centre to promote cooperation between the two parties in the field of vascular surgery, particularly in the area of acute aneurysms.
As a result of the formal collaboration between the vascular surgeons of the two hospitals, the Zhongshan Hospital stated that remote consultations would be conducted, a treatment programme would be developed with the Zhanghai Hospital on-line, job-training programmes would be selected, weekly exchanges of surgical techniques would be carried out jointly, a study would be conducted, etc.; in complex cases, a medical specialist would be invited to the Zhanghai Hospital, depending on the patient ' s needs, in order to have access to the country ' s top medical resources in the province of the south-west.
The two hospitals will also work together on innovative scientific research for surgical operations, the generalization of aneurological diseases and early screening, etc.
Organized by the Beijing Health Promotion Society, the Acoustic Seminar at Nakayama Hospital, University of Xiamen, was held in Xiamen on the same day.
At the same meeting, the two reputable hospitals of the above-mentioned hospital signed a contract for angiosynthetic collaboration centre, which announced a collaborative effort to improve the level of treatment of vascular-related diseases in the south-west of the city.
The Shanghai Long Sea Hospital's only institute of vascular surgery and the only clinical medical centre for vascular system diseases in Shanghai City, as well as the first national priority in vascular surgery, led the establishment of the Chinese Association of Physicians's Professional Committee on Intra-Vitrovascular Science, which is the leading team in the industry.
Professor Wong Xiaojin, Director of the Angiology Department at Nakayama Hospital, Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
Angular surgery, the first independent subject in Fujian province, was provided at the Nakayama Hospital, with a long-term commitment to the treatment of aortic and peri-vascular diseases, and was approved for the construction of a provincial clinical focus in 2018.
In the treatment of aneurysms, there is considerable experience in the treatment of aneurysms in emergency cases, in addition to the treatment of abrasive aneurysms and aneurysms.
" The history of the development of the vascular surgery at the Nakayama Hospital, affiliated with the University of Xiamen, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation are so remarkable in the region that this time we have set up a coordination centre which, in addition to the aorta, will provide a full range of medical, pedagogical and scientific cooperation in the treatment of diseases such as the lower limb artery, the cervical artery and so forth. "
Professor Von Wie, Deputy Director of Angiology, Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said:
The Chinese University Hospital and the Shanghai Long Sea Hospital signed a contract in 2018 for the establishment of the Indigent "Li Myung-shin Medical Clinic".
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of the College's Angiosurgery, in an interview with the Chinese News Network, said that the College's Angiosurgery also had a long history of sharing with the Longhai Hospital, where two hospitals had formally formed a collaborative unit to re-engage on new steps.
He said that the College would regularly invite experts from Shanghai to conduct surgical exchanges, study rooms, discussion of difficult cases, etc., while conducting further remote consultations, which were currently planned once a week; in addition, it would select personnel for further exchange and strengthen the development and development of the academic workforce.
At the meeting, journalists learned that vascular disease was the leading cause of death in China, and that the aortic arteries, as the main path of the various organs of the human body, flowed from the heart to the whole body and played an important role.
The occurrence of aneurystic diseases is often accompanied by high risks, high mortality rates and the difficulty of treatment, with the roughest section of the aortic a diameter of up to 4 cm, leading to a high-risk haemorrhage if an aneurysms are formed, fractures occur, or an inner-vascular fracture creates a layer.
In recent years, as people ' s lifestyles have changed and the pace of life has accelerated, China has become the world ' s first-largest country with high blood pressure, and the number of arctic diseases has increased. Today, along with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is developing in a small, rapid and efficient manner.
Doctors can make a proper "transformation" of the blood flow by piercing their thighs and putting it in the aorta so as to avoid shocks to aneurysms or fractures and achieve good therapeutic results, with some operations even requiring local anesthesia.
More than a dozen national experts were invited to the seminar to discuss new developments in the treatment of aortic diseases, to conduct cutting-edge technical training and to discuss difficult cases in the form of a conference saloon.
At the meeting, journalists learned that, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is now developing in a small, rapid and efficient manner.

The longest high-iron tunnel in the San Gorge is connected to the Central New Network.
2020-07-26 17:34:48 Source: China News Network
This is the construction site for the Tunnel of the Three Cans.
It's from the Central Bureau of Iron and Steel.
On July 26, China Railways Chengdu Group Limited was informed by China News Network Zhongqing (journalist Han Zhongqing) that Zheng Huan Xiaotuan Tunnel, about 18.9 km long, was fully connected on that day.
It is understood that the small three canyon tunnel is not only the longest high iron tunnel in the three canyons area, but also the longest single-hole two-line high iron tunnel designed to reach 350 km/hour per hour as part of a project currently under construction in the country.
Zheng Wangai, located in Henan, Hubei, Chongqing three provinces, is located in Zhengzhou, where Zheng Guang, Xu Langao, and is located in Zhongqing, in the southern province of Huanzhou, is an important part of our high-speed railway network, along the river and in Hunnan.
Zheng Mangtai Tunnel 26th full line.
It's all the way through the scene.
Zheng Wangai was established in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, to the south-west city of Pyeongshan, to the south-west city of Yangyang, Hubei province to Huangzhou district of Huangqing City, with a new route of approximately 818 km long and a design speed of 350 km/hour and about 184 km inside Chongqing territory.
Among them, Zhengzhou-Yingyang began operations on 1 December 2019 and Chongqing is stepping up construction efforts.
The 26-day-lined Tunnel of the Three Cans is the full-line control project for Zheng Mangil, which is located on the border between Phuong Dynasty County and Wushan County in Chongqing City, approximately 18.9 km long and 890 metres deep.
The tunnel began construction in February 2017 and was fully connected on 26 July 2020.
According to the Royal Army, which is responsible for the design of Zheng Wangao Iron Tunnel, the engineering company of China's China Iron II Company, the surveyor, the geology of the location of the Tunnels in the small three canyons is very complex, facing risks such as rock solubility, mud surges, massive deformation of soft rock, a high-risk tunnel of class I, which is extremely difficult to design and construct.
"In the course of the construction of the project, we have adopted a special design for more than 30 types of dissolved holes, using geological survey methods, discovery techniques and advanced drilling methods, such as the design of a bridge that is 24 metres long and extends over 10 metres vertical length and 55 metres deep, and avoids the fall of tunnels. "
According to the Bureau of Iron Tunnels in the construction site, the tunnel was constructed in a combination of decoupling methods, through the construction of cross-hole smoothing, slurping, reinforcement of tunnel structure support and construction of sewage treatment stations, which both ensured the orderly advance of the project and avoided damage to the water bodies in the small three canyon landscape, while successfully overcoming such difficult geological problems as 7 km of massive deformation of soft rock with a maximum daily flow of 157,000 cubic metres of mud.
The construction of the Zheng Huanggau railway line will make it a new easy and fast passenger route from the south-west to the centre of China, north-east and north-east of the country. It will be important to improve the capacity and quality of the north-east-to-railway route in the south-west, improve the layout of the regional road network, speed up the development and urbanization of tourism resources along the routes, promote coordinated regional development and promote the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say it's unconstitutional to collect immigration data from the U.S. Census for the distribution of seats in the House.
Some civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties have filed lawsuits against the U.S. federal government alleging that President Trump's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census would not work and would be unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
The executive lawyer of the American Civil Liberties Union, Sarah Brandon, said to the Voice of America, "This is not going to work."
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of the person surveyed in the census was difficult to achieve and was "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties organization filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Some of the cities in New Jersey, Georgia, have joined the suit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the suit on Friday.
"The United States Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years... we must take an accurate count of everyone living in Arlington County and not let this illegal attempt to scare people away and reduce the number of our immigrant communities succeed. "
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
The Justice Minister of Alabama, Marshall, claimed that the executive order was a "winner" in the state.
He said, " When allocating seats in the House of Representatives of the National Assembly and in the electoral college in each state, it is necessary to determine the number of residents living in the canton and the number of legally resident residents ... "
The Supreme Court of the United States prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship in the 2020 census last year.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing the United States Census Department's business minister, Ross, to regulate the data on the unlicensed population from the census so that the administration could exclude these unlicensed populations from the census figures of the states and thereby determine whether each state would increase or reduce or maintain the number of members of the House of Representatives.

In response, the construction of industrial projects -- headlines -- Hunan Daily News Network -- China Voice Online
Hunan in the middle of the summer, the heat waves.
And the passions that will be unleashed by building an industry project across the province, after a three-volt heat, are inspired by the sharp guidance of "Industry over Power, Hero for Project".
Hunan's development always depends on building projects and developing industries.
In the face of the extraordinary first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the party centered on Comrade Xi, the whole province insisted on playing a game of chess, fighting the disease, fighting two hard battles, using industrial projects as a "precedent" for the implementation of the "Six Stable" six-prong.
From a 1.9% decline in GDP in the first quarter to a 1.3% increase in the first half of the year, the hard times, the hard work, the obvious.
On this precious report card, industrial project construction is the key to accelerating the recovery and stability of Hunan.
It's okay, it's irreversible.
Industrial project construction needs to be put in the big picture. It's strong, aggressive, aggressive, knowledgeable, change-oriented, change-oriented.
Against the backdrop of the complexity and gravity of the current international situation, it is necessary to study the new features of the current situation in a quiet manner, with a greater sense of regularity, scientific precision and better integration into a new pattern of development, dominated by the large domestic and international cycles, which are mutually reinforcing.
More emphasis on upgrading industrial infrastructure.
In the first half of the year, not only did I have a large number of heavy investment projects in new and emerging industries that began to break ground and sow hope, but the industries with more traditional advantages accelerated their deployment points in terms of digitalization, intellectualization, greening industrial transformation.
The Liyang Oscon III Science Park project is retrofitting existing production lines, with high-end printing of circuit board smart production lines, and the new plant in Hunan Province dedicated to the intellectual transformation and construction of modern plants, as well as a vivid picture of the emergence of the old tree... focusing on the country's major strategy and two new ones, on strengthening the dominant industries, actively developing new industries, expanding technological innovation and national production alternatives in order to build on basic conditions and build on transformational energy.
More emphasis on fostering new business models for the development of new economies.
The sudden onset of the new coronary epidemic has given rise to the growth of the cloud economy, unleashing the potential of the digital economy and providing new opportunities for industrial change: in the first half of the year, I saved computers and office equipment manufacturing, electronics and communications manufacturing by 12.6 per cent, retail sales by wholesalers above the limit by 32.2 per cent over the same period, and food companies by 35.6 per cent over the same period.
New machines are being created in the crisis, new dynamics are being created, the digital industry is being actively promoted, the industry is being digitalized, and the digital economy and the real economy are becoming more integrated.
Increased focus on optimizing and stabilizing supply chains in industrial chains
Engineering machinery is the main force in the Hunan industry, but two thirds of the associated businesses are out of the province and there is room and potential in the chain.
Strengthening industrial chain thinking projects requires not only the sustained accumulation of front-line firms and technological breakthroughs at key links in the chain; they also need to be nurtured locally so that strong chain-reconnecting chains can trigger chain lock-down reactions, promote the synergistic layout of the relevant supporting industries and accelerate the building of an autonomous, controlled and secure supply chain of industrial chains.
It's a good business environment in Hunan, a hot land of market opportunities, a land of pleasure.

It's about researching industry, nurturing it, developing it, putting business to good use. It's gonna win more investors' favors.
The wind is still ahead, but the state of the storm has become the norm for building industrial projects across the province to advance high-quality development.
At this critical time, it is important to learn to follow the spirit of the important instructions of the General Secretary of Xi and to respond effectively to external uncertainties with the certainty of his work, to sustain the construction of industrial projects, to spread the sweat, to ensure the successful completion of the 13th Five-Five and the complete construction of a small and well-being society.

The overall level of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature" - a new net.

The overall level of employment and prices shows that there's a temperature in the economy.
Economic Journalist, China Economic Network Reporter, Shin Lin
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, China has taken a comprehensive approach to the prevention and control of the epidemic and the economic and social development of the country. The situation is improving. The economy has recovered steadily, and employment and prices, which are closely related to people's lives, have generally stabilized. China's economy has handed over a temperatureed economic performance card.
The survey unemployment rate rose in the first two months of the year.
In February, in particular, many enterprises were largely cut off from production, demand for workers was reduced, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and unemployment in urban surveys increased.
With the gradual improvement in the situation with regard to the prevention and control of the epidemic, the whole society has returned to the order of life in production.
The Party's central government is committed to the overall thrust of a steady and well-attractive approach to employment, further strengthening macro-policy responses, strengthening employment priorities across the board, and actively promoting job-strenching support.
We have stepped up our policies to stabilize jobs, put in place a combination of relief and respite measures, phased relief of three contributions to social insurance units, allowing for the extension of social insurance contributions, expansion of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises, return of unemployment insurance to the benefit of the job-training policy, inclusion of subsidies in enterprises for the employment of priority groups, study allowances, etc.
As the implementation of employment policies has fallen, the demand for jobs in enterprises has steadily recovered, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the unemployment rate in urban surveys has gradually declined, with the unemployment rate in June being 5.7 per cent.
According to Zhang Yi, Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of the National Statistics Institute, employment policies continued to work in the second quarter, with a gradual return of workers who had left their jobs due to the effects of the epidemic and an increase of about 10 percentage points in urban labour participation in June compared to February, close to the same level in the same period last year.
The data show that total urban employment increased by more than 19 per cent in June than in February, with most industries reaching pre-disease levels; the average weekly working hours for employed workers in enterprises amounted to 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours from February and a slight increase of 0.1 hours from January.
Prices also affect thousands of families.
In January this year, the CPI increased by 5.4 per cent over the same period, up from years of growth.
In February, the CPI rose slightly, but it's still in Area 5.
The increase in the CPI ratio is high, with both pre-spring consumption demand pull factors and spring miscalculation and lower than the same base.
However, the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly evident.
Epidemic control affected the country by delays in logistics in January and February, delays in the supply of goods, increased transport costs, etc., as well as a significant increase in the price of some of the basic necessities of life as a result of hoarding and looting by some citizens.
In order to respond to the disruptions caused by the control of the epidemic in the price situation, the authorities included vital items in the emergency transport guarantee and ensured the smooth transport of goods.
The market supply of vegetable guacamole is strongly guaranteed by a series of policy initiatives.
In response to the rapid increase in the price of pork at the beginning of this year, following the introduction of a policy of guaranteed and stable prices at the central level, there was rapid implementation in various regions, with a marked improvement in the supply of pork reserves, an orderly restoration of the capacity to produce and produce and a gradual normalization of the distribution order.
Since March, the price of pork has been declining continuously, driving food prices back to 10.6 per cent in May, and in June, the price of pork has risen slightly, owing to a slowdown in the production of pigs, a decline in imports and a rise in the demand for group consumption.
Seasonal variations in the price of fresh vegetables are evident, with an average increase of 3.4 per cent in the first half of the year.
As a result of the higher comparative base for the same period last year, fresh fruit prices continued to decline over the same period, falling by an average of 13.3 per cent in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the population is effectively guaranteed and the economic and social situation remains stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transport logistics and increased local coverage, market supply and demand have improved.
Since March, the CPI ring has declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has fallen from 4.3 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in June. Price levels have generally recovered.
In the second half of the year, our prices will continue to remain moderate, with little overall inflationary pressure, but will still have to contribute to the restoration of productive living order in the context of disease control and normalization.
To respond effectively to natural disasters, such as floods in the main agricultural areas, such as food, fruit and vegetables, and drought, to strengthen market regulation, and to fight firmly against market disorder such as the hoarding of surprises and price hikes.

Today, the opening ceremony of the 2020 Hong Kong Red Tourism Cultural Festival and the inaugural Red Cultural Industry Fair is held in Xingshan.
The opening of the Red Tourism Culture Festival was opened by the Provincial Council Standing Committee, the Minister of Communication of the Provincial Council, Zhang Hun Sen, and a statement was made by Vice-Governor U Guiying.
The Hunan Red Tour Culture Festival has been successfully held for 16 years. It is a famous brand of national red tourism.
The festival was co-sponsored by the Ministry of Communication of the Provincial Council, the Department of Culture and Tourism, and the Municipal Council of the City of Zhao.
Wu Guiying said that the holding of the festival was important for following up on the important directive of General Secretary Xi Xi to make good use of the red resources, build on the red tradition and pass on the red genes, and further grasp the development of the red tourism industry, promote the recovery of the market and bring the red forces together as a broad synergy in building a new lake of great beauty and happiness.

As an artist, communication is very important to me.
Through my work of art, I try to make it clear that human beings are not separated from nature, but that everything is connected.
The first time I went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, I saw an iceberg for the first time.
I'm afraid.
My heart thumps fast, dizziness, trying to understand what's in front of me.
I can only find it strange that the icebergs around me are almost 200 feet above the surface, and this is a snowflake covered in another snowflake, formed year after year.
The formation of icebergs is when they break from the glaciers or from the ice shelf.
Every iceberg has its own unique personality.
They interact with their surroundings and their circumstances in a clear way.
Some of the icebergs refuse to compromise and stick to the end, while others can't stand a burst of ice in a flash of passion.
When you see an iceberg, it's easy to think that they're all isolated, they're independent, they're separate, they're more like what we humans sometimes think of ourselves.
But it's more than that.
As the iceberg melted, I breathed into its ancient scent.
As the iceberg melts, it releases fresh water rich in minerals that nourishes everything.
I started filming these icebergs as if I was taking portraits of my ancestors, and I realized at these moments that the icebergs existed in that way, but never again.
When they melt, it's not death; it's not an end, it's a continuation of the path to life.
I've filmed icebergs, some of which are very young -- thousands of years old.
Some ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last picture I'd like to show you is an iceberg that I shot on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
It's a very rare opportunity for people to actually witness an iceberg roll.
So that's what it says.
On the left you can see a boat.
It's a boat about 15 feet.
I want you to be aware of the shape of an iceberg that's deformed on the surface of the water.
Here you see it rolls, the boat moves to the other side, and a man stands there.
It's an average size Greenland iceberg.
It surfaced about 120 feet high or 40 metres high.
This video was taken in real time.
Like this iceberg, they show you different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)

Question: Qinghai Lake "Flower Sea Lives": "Sweet" to help farmers raise their incomes
Author, Hu Guilong, Pan Yujie.
" The high altitude, the high temperature of the day and the night, the low air pollution, the strong light that breeds the most tenacious and generous bee, the high activity, the high protein, the nutritional value, the low sugar fat, and the high activity of the bee ' s bee. "
On 26 June, Qinghai Province, Zhang Jian-hoon, Deputy Director of Industry and Information Administration of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Region, stated that ...
On that day, a live feed of the "Single of the Hearts of War" was held on the shores of Qinghai Lake, with representatives of the Chinese Bee Products Association and entrepreneurs, the Humming Farmers and others gathered to promote the Qinghai specialty products, selling online almost 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau Maple, for a total of nearly $3.8 million.
It shows bee products at the bee farmer's site.
According to the news, the live delivery campaign was supported by the Beijing Hode Beacon chain network, the fast-hands, the country's famous bee-sale retail businesses, live, the electric power company platform, which led to "business plus the bee farmer plus grower" exchanges, and the continuous distribution of "spring coupons" to consumers via online and offline channels, which are expected to yield a total of nearly $5.28 million a year.
In response, Chennai, President of the Hode Bee Industry Corporation, Beijing, said, "It's worth it: "This will increase the visibility of the Qinghui products, attract more consumers, prefer the pure natural bees without adding to them, and drive the bee farmers to grow."
At present, the company has entered into a strategic production cooperation agreement with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industries Ltd. and the Qinghua Bee Corporation, which seeks to contribute to the growth of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
Here's a picture of the Qinghui River by the Qinghui River.
This spring, the farmers' journey to "honey-seeking" has been hampered by the need to set road crossings to prevent and control the epidemic, and many bees have died because they missed their flowers and lacked food, and their incomes have been severely affected.
"One year to the end, the bee farmers traveled long distances from Yunnan to Sichuan north to the northwest, where they slept in the open and inhospitable.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them ... "
She's calling it.
"Bees are `environmental scouts', and bees in heavily contaminated areas cannot survive. " The Vice-President of the China Bee Products Association, Zhao Xiaochuan, described bee pollination as an important link in the ecological chain and an irreplaceable contribution to the protection of plant diversity and the improvement of the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination increases the quality of crops, especially in areas that are widespread and poorly managed.
According to research, pollination can increase the production of oilseeds by 15-30%.
Here's a picture of Zhao Xiaochuan (right) introducing the Qinghui products to the Standing Vice-President of the China Bee Products Association.
" The economic, ecological and social benefits of bee pollination are far greater than the value of the bee product itself, and the bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological conservation, which has been poorly known ... "
Zhao Xiaochuan said:
Today, the number of beekeepers is getting smaller, and in addition to the year-rounded beekeepers, many poor households with limited mobility have chosen to share in the co-operatives with beehive boxes.
" The State has financial support, we have contacts with technicians to help guide the farmers, lack of knowledge and judgement about the market environment, and need the help and coordination of the Government, enterprises and industry associations to open up the market ... "
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope you will pay more attention in the future to help the bee-rearing community," Yana said, "Our bee products are also strictly screened and controlled according to national standards, ensuring quality and protecting consumer rights while helping the bee farmers."
As a result of sustained rainfall, since 22 July, the earth has been fractured in the wake of the fort slides in the middle of the village of Wuhui, Chongqing Province, resulting in a wide-scale slide and deformation that has completely cut off 13 metres of water in front of the dam and estimates that the reservoir has a capacity of approximately 550,000 cubic metres.
In order to ensure safe navigation, Chongqing's maritime department decided to impose temporary traffic controls on the Yangtze Stoneboard to the Audience Beach waters.
Chongqing Meteorological and Hydrological Service monitors that since 25th, heavy rains have been prevalent in the centre-west and north-east of Chongqing, with heavy rains in some areas and heavy rains in the field.
On the night of the 26th, the river dam will have its highest level of water, which is close to the alert level.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, Chongqing maritime authorities decided to impose temporary traffic controls on the Yangtze Stoneboard to the Audience Beach waters ...
Following an urgent consultation between Chongqing City Defense Office and meteorological, hydro, hydrological and other departments and agencies, the Chongqing City Anti-Drying Command has decided to release early warning information on river floods, level III, and initiate an emergency response to the Qin IV emergency.
The Chongqing City Command for Drought Control and Prevention demands that concerned members of the Chongqing North, Sabang Dam, Yunnan, Wulong Districts and Chongqing Townships pay a high level of attention to the rain situation, particularly the Yangtze, Kayang River, the Umang River, the change of water, the advance analysis and assessment, the issuance of early warning, the strengthening of patrols, the resolute and decisive evacuation of the population in the threatened areas, the timely mobilization of emergency relief teams and supplies, the rapid and efficient management of the disaster, and the avoidance of mass casualties.
Minister Counsellor Zheng Chong, Minister Counsellor, Embassy of Viet Nam in Laos, together with representatives of the Lao Buddhist Association, the General Association of Vietnamese in Laos, representatives of the provincial government of Vientiane, the Lao Association of Veterans, etc., participated in the ceremony.
The ceremony was held in a solemn atmosphere, and delegates continued to celebrate the great achievements of the great men and the special bonds of solidarity of the ages.
In his address, Minister Counsellor Zheng Zheng said that this was an opportunity for both Vietnamese and Laos to join in the memory of the two countries ' revolution and to express their gratitude for the great sacrifices they made for their independence, as well as a good opportunity for the two peoples to recall that the two countries worked together to fight the common enemy, achieve national independence, national unity, build national development and consolidate relations between the two countries.
Seventy-four years ago, on January 23, 1946, 28 fighters of the Viet Nam Combat Coalition died heroically while attacking the Phonehe stronghold.
The victory of this attack was a historic victory for both countries in the early stages of the revolutionary struggle for national liberation.
Ms. Chung stressed that the peoples of the two countries will always remember the great sacrifices they made in the cause of the struggle for national liberation, while stressing that the youth of the two countries will continue to build on the bravery and strong traditions of their predecessors and to make their due contribution to the continued flourishing of old-age relations and the prosperous development of both countries.
Milestone crossing!
International Milan Unlocking 3000 Armours - New Net
On July 26, Beijing time, in the early hours of the 26th, a landmark battle took place in Milan International.
According to Italian media statistics, the game of the guest field against Genoa was the 3000th International Milanic League, and the Blue Black Army was the first team to unlock this milestone.
International Milan has been the only team ever to fail since the game was changed in 1929, and the only team ever downgraded.
According to Italian media reports, the international Milan-Genoa match is the 3000th game in Blue Black Army history.
In this landmark battle, the International Milan Pass won three goals in Genoa.
This is Lucacume's second round, and Sanchez, who's playing for him, has a goal.
From the very beginning, the game entered the rhythm of international Milan, and the strong attack finally turned into a goal in the 34th minute.
In the middle of Biraki left road, the Lucaku middle-run ball broke through the door.
In the 82nd minute, following the breaking of the right road in Moses, the Sanches middle road was shot; before the end, Lucaku completed the second degree of May, countered by Brozovic at a long distance, and Lukaku pushed the empty door after crossing Romero in the restricted area, with a score of 3:0.
At 3:0 in the international airport of Milan to Genoa, the score went up to 2, and the leader Yoventus was 4 in a race, still holding his hopes.
So, in the 3,000 A.A. contests that have crossed nearly 90, Milan won 1,489 of them, leveled 834, lost 677 and won 49.6 per cent.
In the meantime, the team scored 5038, threw 3102, and the field scored 1.68.
The Blue Black Army won the league 18 times and never downgraded.
The statement stated that the drone had fallen inside Lebanese territory while carrying out its mission near the Blue Line on the Israeli-Lebanese border.
The statement does not mention the reason for the drone crash.
According to Israeli media reports, this drone may have crashed as a result of a malfunction.
It was reported that the Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, Ganz, during his visit to northern Israel that afternoon, had indicated that Israel would continue to take action against Syria and Lebanon in order to ensure its security interests.
Israel has long regarded Hizbullah in Lebanon as a major security threat and has accused the Iranian side of sending weapons to Hizbullah in Lebanon through the Syrian land corridor, while the situation around the Israeli-Lebanese border has been tense.
Israel has repeatedly carried out air strikes against Syrian targets on the basis of attacks against the organization.

"The Winner" of the Big Wars by Liu Yunyu, Yin Fei, Liu Yun Long, Su-ching, Li Li Li Quan and others, landed at 7:30 p.m. on July 16th in Guangdong Watching the Dynamic Theatre.
The play talks about a Chinese Communist Party underground member, Tang Fei, who was hiding at the Japanese police station, who joined Soviet agents to assassinate the Japanese operative's head and to crush the Japanese army's shocking plot.
"The Winner" is based on historical facts, drawn from Soviet military archives that have been sealed for years.
During the Moscow Defence War, the Soviet Red Army advanced to the far east, when the Japanese Kandong Army, the "Northwards" considered fit and willing to fight.
In order to get rid of the enemy, the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Soviet Socialist Republic of China have joined forces to implement the Mudanura project.
According to this historical background, the famous writer, Dunbara, has been grinding a few times, causing the drama to burn its head.
Yoo Yun-lung is the producer and the lead man in the "winners" this time.
In the play, he played Tang Fei as Chief of the Crime Section of the River Police Department, as a happy and even a stuttering cop, and as a member of the Communist Party underground.
The leading actress in the competition, Cai Man, is the head of the Lin River Security Department, and he has a deep appreciation of the Japanese superior Shifuhara, and he has a delicate relationship with Tang Fei.
Su-young has tried a lot of different roles in recent years, ranging from Luo-yun in "We Were Young" to Yeo-jin in "The Jubilee."
This is the first time that Suqing and Yoyo Yun-lone are partners, and the stuttering sheriff has a very new look.
In addition to the two main players, Li Li Liquan, Chai Bo, Rehan, Shin Sorority, and many other powerful actors joined in the show.
It's known that the "winner" is also very good, with teams taking pictures nearly 2,000 km across Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Liaoning 3 provinces.
In order to restore the urban landscape of the Northeast, which was so strange that time and time, the studios were working day and night, working on every detail of the milling scene and the prop, making the middle scene beautiful and historic.
Floods in the two western governorates of Yemen killed 16 people - the Sino-Sinonet
News from Xinhua News Agency, Kuwait City (journalist Nee Yunpeng Wang Wei), Sana ' a: According to local Yemeni media, on 26 July, heavy rains were reported in Hodeida and Al-Hajja governorates in western Yemen, resulting in at least 16 deaths in the last 48 hours of flooding.
According to reports, flooding caused by rainfall in Hodeida province killed 13 people and three people in nearby Haj province died in flooding.
In addition, dozens of houses in northern Hodeida and southern Haj provinces were destroyed by floods and some roads and agricultural lands were destroyed to varying degrees.
The military conflict that lasted for several years has caused the health system in Yemen to near collapse.
According to statistics from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, more than 1 million people have been infected with cholera in Yemen and more than 2,000 have died since 2017.
Yemeni medical institutions fear that continued flooding will lead to a resurgence of the cholera epidemic.
"The Jedi Strike" is on the air.
Liao William, Dong-woo, Yang Hin-chun, Wang Yebo's online film "The Jedi Strike" is officially featured in the Aki Art.
The film tells the story of the poor fighter Venus returning to the ring and fighting for dignity, and shows a hot, bloody dream-and-dream trip.
The movie "The Jedi Strike" was driven by Thailand's main case, using "Thai Box" as the starting point for the dream of Venus, the story of which was based on adaptations of traditional Chinese cultural values, whether Venus's determination to play a false fist for his master or his efforts to revive the fight for dignity, with the support of friends and lovers, demonstrated the male pursuit of family and dreams in traditional Chinese culture.
Together with the classic Hollywood movie story model and the strong combination of Chinese and Thai professional teams, the Jedi strike not only has an international effect, but will also impress different types of audiences.
At the same time, the Jedi strike was a massive display of Thai boxing and training, the intensity of the scene and the heat of blood.
In the video, a game designer, Zhang Xiaoqian, played by Dongwoo, helped Venus, played by William Liao, to return to the ring and take down the crown, combining the new fancy high-tech with the hot-blooded race, and showing a fraternal friendship between her and Venus, which seemed "different."
In addition, the love between Venus and Crystal is very touching, and the silent support that Jing has been for Venus and the strong commitment of Venus to Jing has brought to the audience a sense of the "ironish love" on Venus and has added a lot to this poor boxer.

In the green, a new round of transformations is being launched. 17.5% of the shares of Shanghai State capital are being transferred.
On July 26th, the Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) issued "an indicative announcement that state-owned shareholders intend to transfer part of the company's shares and duplicate cards by means of an open call for concessions".
The announcement indicates that, in order to further deepen the reform of State enterprises, optimize the restructuring of the State's capital allocation and improve the structure of the greenfield equity, the Haut-Haïtien Company Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "up-Haïtien") and Shanghai City Throw Company Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "up-Haïtien") intend to transfer part of the company's shares by means of an open concession, with the total share to be transferred not exceeding 17.5 per cent of the total stock of the greenfield.
The price of the shares to be transferred is not less than the average of the weighted average daily price for the first 30 trading days of the indicative bulletin date (27 July 2020); the value of each net asset audited by the company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investors in the greenfield are still uncertain, and according to the announcement information, it is estimated that 17.5 per cent of the equity transfer in the greenfield will require the payment of approximately $14 billion.
It is worth noting that, after the completion of this transfer, the greenfield is expected to remain free of controlling shareholders and the actual controlling person, but the structure of control is likely to change significantly.
Since its creation, there have been a number of institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, operating under a purely State-owned system in accordance with market rules; from 1997 to 2013, the establishment and continuous improvement of the public-owned, employee-owned equity system; from 2013 to 2015, the introduction of strategic investors into a mixed system of mixed ownership of State-owned and non-public-owned capital; and from 2015 to the present, the general public has been listed as a public corporation.
The greenfield ' s current mix-up is similar to the G. In December 2019, the H.M. Joo-Hyuk took over 15 per cent of the G.I.A. (000651.S.Z.) shares with 41.662 billion yuan, and G.G.G.G. withdrew to small shareholders, after which G.I. implemented a senior management incentive scheme, with no physical control of the structure of the enterprise.
In Shanghai, which is owned by the Shanghai State Investment Commission and is owned by the Chairman of the Greenfield Holding Board, President Zhang Yu Liang stated that the Greenfield initiative was an important step towards comprehensive reform of State enterprises, in accordance with the central requirements of the Party, to accelerate a new phase of reform of State enterprises, and that it demonstrated a new approach to reform that was tailored to local conditions and tailored to the needs of the public, by introducing new strategic shareholders to listed companies, by supporting businesses to further increase their level of marketability, increase their freedom of management and accelerate the full release of the reforms.
The first trans-provincial car tour in the country was launched by Xinhua Network.
On 25 July, at 12.20 p.m. on the 25th of July, Xinhua news agency (journalist Lee Ping), more than 200 Shanghai tourists travelling in D771 vehicles arrived successfully in Lanbrook City, Zhejiang Province. This was the first time that the Ministry of Culture and Tourism had resumed a cross-provincial (district, city) team tour since 14 July.
In the city of Lanbrook in the Midwest of the Zhejiang River, the city is rich and rich, and it is home to a number of famous attractions, such as the village of Zhejiang, the village of Zhejiang, and the village of Zhi Xiangu. Over 200 Shanghai tourists will have a glimpse of these attractions on a two-day and one-night journey.
Lee Lee, Deputy Managing Director, Shanghai Railways International Tourism (GSO) Ltd., said that under the latest policy, the company was focused on cross-provincial needs, approached Lanbrook City first and introduced the products Shanghai to Lanbrook and Summer Two Days, which were sold out less than a week ago.
Aunt Sun from Shanghai says she hasn't been out this year because of the epidemic.
"As soon as you see a team trip at home, share the information with your friends and never come to Lanbrook before and look forward to this trip..." said Auntie Sun.
It is understood that in September last year a strategic cooperation agreement was signed between Lanbrook City and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Shanghai Group) Ltd. for the project "Big Iron Rueland Creek" and that it is planned to open 12 high-terrain tours to Lanbrook in a year.
I hit myself in the face?
U.S. White House consultant, "Bite Back" states, getting back to work too early - a new net.
It's too early for White House consultant, "Bite Back" states to get back to work.
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30 per cent of global cases.
For months, United States President Trump had repeatedly asked the states to return to school until recently when they changed their attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, while his adviser, who was a "backbite", had called it premature for some state governments to return to work.
In a press conference on 22 November, the White House presidential adviser, Karen Conway, stated that some state governments had not complied with the resumption criteria and had prematurely reopened places like bars.
Conway also mentioned that earlier statements that the President had "absolute power" to decide on the re-entry of the states were false rumours.
"The President is a federalist, and he believes in the autonomy of the states. "
She defended Trump.
However, Conway's rumours were told personally by Trump at the White House outbreak briefing on April 13th.
In this self-absorption operation, the netizens mocked it as "rewriting history."
Kelly Ann Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to get back to work so he can hold a rally.
It's not the first time Kelly Ann Conway's in dispute.
On April 15, Conway spoke out in an interview with Fox News: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to have understood "19" as a version number, which the netizens are crazy about: read the papers without common sense!
Recently, we saw the impact of cyber attacks on the business world.
The leak of data from firms like Morgan Chase, Yahoo, Despouy and Tagjit caused hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars.
A few more attacks like this, the world economy will collapse.
The public sphere is not immune.
From 2012 to 2014, the U.S. Personnel Management Office had very serious data leaks.
Security clearances and fingerprint information were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
As you may have heard, some government-funded hackers are trying to use stolen data to influence election results in some countries.
The last two cases were a large-scale theft of data in the German Bundestag, and an e-mail theft in the National Democratic Committee.
Cyber-threats have affected our democratic process.
And there's a growing trend.
The more advanced computer technology, the more vulnerable the tools we use to protect data.
In particular, a new computer technology, called quantum computers, uses microparticles from nature to significantly increase the computing power of computers.
It's so powerful that it can break through many of the encryption systems we're using today.
So are we hopeless?
Shouldn't we start packing up electronic survival gear to meet the end of the coming data?
I don't think it's that far.
Quantum computers are still in the lab, and it's going to take years to do it.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in encryption.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of safe communication.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we've unlocked new skills to create quantum effects that don't exist in nature, and I'm very excited.
The idea of using the basic laws of physics to advance encryption technology is exciting.
Today, selected companies and laboratories, including mine, have moved this technology to the stage of practical application.
That's right.
We're going to use quantum against quantum.
How do we do that?
First, let's get a quick look at the encrypted world.
You need a briefcase, and you have some important documents for your good friend, James Bond, to lock it up and keep it safe.
Because these materials are top secret, we're going to use a super-advanced briefcase.
It's equipped with a special password lock, and once it's locked, it converts the contents of the file to random numbers.
So all you have to do is put the file in, lock it, and by this time the file has been converted to random numbers, and you send this briefcase to James.
When the briefcase isn't delivered, you call him and give him the code.
Once he gets the briefcase, enters the password, deciphers the file, it's perfect, and you've successfully passed an encrypted message to James Bond.
A funny example, but it shows the three points of encryption.
Password -- what we call encryption keys.
You can imagine it as a code.
The phone that gave James the code.
We call it a secret key pass.
It'll make sure we get the key safely to the designated location.
And locks for encryption and decryption.
We call it encryption algorithms.
By using the key, it converts the contents of the file to random numbers.
A good algorithm can do that, and without the key it's hard to crack the code.
The importance of algorithms is that if someone gets the briefcase, opens it, without the key, without the encryption algorithm, they can't read what's in the document.
All I get is random numbers.
Most of the security systems rely on secure key delivery, passing the key to the right place.
However, the rapid growth of computing power jeopardizes many of the key-transmitting methods that we currently use.
For example, we now have a very wide-ranging system -- RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 40 million years to crack a 426-bit RSA key.
And in 1994, only 17 years later, the code was broken.
As computer performance grows, so does the code we need.
Now we often use a 2048 or 4096-bit password.
As you can see, the battle between the decryptors and the decryptors is under way, all trying to beat each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers will be able to break into complex mathematical algorithms faster, which are the basis of the encryption system that we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our safe castle into a touchdown cardhouse.
We'll try to protect our castle.
In recent years, a number of research institutions have emerged to study the use of quantum effects to enhance encryption.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the three key points of encryption, the high-quality key, the secure key pass, and the strong algorithm.
However, advances in science and engineering have jeopardized two of their priorities.
It's the key that's at the top of the list.
Random numbers form the basis of the key.
But today, they're no longer really random.
At the moment, we generate the key, based on random digital frequencies, software-generated, which we call pseudo-random numbers.
There will always be some, perhaps not so obvious patterns in the numbers generated by programs or mathematical methods.
The lower the randomity of these numbers, or, in terms of terminology, the lower they contain, the easier they are to be predicted.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked in creative ways.
They shot the tiger for a while, and they analyzed it.
Internet criminals use reverse engineering to create a pseudo-random digital generator behind the wheel.
So they have a good chance of predicting the turn of the wheel, making a lot of money.
The key is also not safe.
Having a real random digital generator is important for creating a secure password.
For years, researchers have been trying to create a real random digital generator.
But most designs are either not random enough, not fast enough, not easy to repeat.
But the quantum world is really random.
It's very important to take advantage of this real randomity.
Devices that measure quantum effects can generate constant, random digital flows very quickly.
The casino crime we were talking about is no longer possible.
Several universities and companies from around the world are focusing on making real random digital generators.
In my company, our quantum random digital generator was born on a two-metre-long optical table.
Then we narrow it down to a box size.
By today, you can load it on a PCI card, plug it into a normal computer.
This is the fastest, really random digital generator in the world.
By measuring quantum effects, it generates a billion random numbers per second.
Today has been widely used around the world to enhance the security of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
But even with a real random digital generator, we're facing a second major cyber security threat: the security of the key.
The current key transfer technology can't fight quantum computers.
And the quantum solution to this problem is called quantum key distribution, short of QKD, which uses a foundation of quantum mechanics as a counterintuitive feature.
The act of observing microparticles changes the particle.
Let me give you an example.
Let's think again, give the code to James Bond.
But this time, we don't call him, we use the quantum effect, we carry this code with a bunch of lasers, and we pass it through ordinary fibers to James.
Let's assume Dr. Nobbs wants the code.
Fortunately, Dr. Nobb is trying to intercept this quantum key with electronic fingerprints, as James and you can see.
The key that's blocked will be invalidated.
And the key that's left will provide a powerful protection for the data.
Because this safety mechanism is based on the fundamentals of physics, quantum computers, or any future supercomputer, and it's impossible to crack it.
My team and I are working with many top universities and defense departments to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of safety products.
The Internet is predicting an era of high connectivity, and it is expected that 25-30 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020.
If our society is going to function in a world where things are connected, then trust in these interconnective devices systems is essential.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important in building this trust, and it will guarantee us the full enjoyment of these magical innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you.

Three-year-old kid college playgrounds are wrecked and paid for before filing a lawsuit against the school?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Daily Journal of the Rule of Law
The playground was destroyed and the children were awarded compensation before they sued the school.
□ The correspondent of this newspaper, Zhao Yifan
Three-year-old Wen was accidentally hit in the head by a softball team when he was playing in a college playground.
After some compensation, his father, Mr. Wen, brought him before the court as his legal representative, asking him to apologize to the school where he was in the workplace and to pay for medical expenses, moral damages, and so on, for a total of $20,000.
Recently, after hearing the case, the People ' s Court of the Haidian District of Beijing found that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, had fulfilled its obligation of adequate safety and security and that Chen had paid compensation, and that the plaintiff ' s claim had been dismissed.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer of 2019, he was playing in the school playground with young Man, while the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risks involved, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents are operating in the safety zone designated by the softball team.
But then the softball team, Chen Yai, took off during the pitch, causing the softballs to fly across the net to the safety zone and hit the back of the small text.
Mr. Wen took Siu Wen to the hospital immediately and was diagnosed with a head trauma.
According to Mr. Wen, the facilities at the school stadium did not comply with the relevant security requirements and did not effectively manage the team and related facilities ...
The school ' s negligence has led to the above-mentioned events, causing great physical and psychological suffering and causing greater suffering to the family, for which the school is legally responsible.
In response, the school argued that it had installed a safety net in the playground and had posted regulations, training notices, instructions to enter the playground to be safe from the training site and to alert itself to safety, and that the plaintiff could not prove that the school was "not in compliance with its safety obligations" and therefore did not accept compensation.
The court considered that the site in question was a free-of-charge open site for the public at the university and that, while there was a safety and security obligation for the management of the playground, such a security obligation would have to meet the general duty of care ...
At the time of the incident, the school had installed a safety net in the playground and had fulfilled its obligation to provide adequate safety and security, and Chen had paid Xiaowen more than $2,000 in damages for medical expenses, transportation, etc., in accordance with a previous compensation agreement. The parties agreed to settle the dispute once and for all.
Later, the parents again claimed compensation for the school, which was not justified by law, and the court decided to dismiss all the plaintiffs ' claims.
After the judgement was delivered, neither party appealed, and the judgement is now in force.
Under article 37 of our Tort Liability Act, schools, as managers of public places, have a duty of safety and security; in the case of damage caused by the conduct of a third person, the third person is liable for the violation, while those public places managers who fail to comply with the obligation of safety and security are liable for the corresponding additional responsibility.
According to the judge, since it is most likely that, as the administrator of a public place, he will be able to understand the actual situation of the site as a whole, anticipate the risks and damage that may occur, thus making it most likely that the necessary measures will be taken to prevent the occurrence of the loss or to mitigate the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the lowest cost of the damage, the law will impose on him the corresponding obligation to safeguard the performance of social activities ...
In the present case, the safety and security obligations of schools should be commensurate with the social activities they engage in, in particular, the basic security measures and the obligation to inform about hidden risks, in relation to the specific groups of people entering the playgrounds, which are open free of charge to the public ...
Nor is it appropriate in judicial practice to impose excessive security obligations on public administrators ...
If the school has adopted a safety net and has fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be assumed that the school is not guilty and should not be held legally liable.
In addition, the liability of third-party infringers, even if the managers of public places, such as schools, do not fulfil their security obligations, is a supplement to compensation for damages, and, under the recently enacted Civil Code, the administrator may also recover from the third person after assuming additional liability.
Thus, in such an incident, the victim should not extend the claim after having received compensation from the direct infringer ...
Today I want to show you the way we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembly, self-replicating and self-rehabilitating.
So I'm going to show you what I think is going on in manufacturing, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years, half a million parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have an exciting machine that can take us into space -- five years, two and a half million parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million types of protein that can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, and we can copy DNA with 3 billion base pairs in about an hour.
That's the complexity of our natural systems, but they're very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, more complex than anything we can build.
They're more energy efficient.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can fix themselves and stay alive.
There's something really interesting about the natural system.
If we can turn it into our built environment, then the way we build things has great potential.
I think it's about self-assembling.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we're going to build -- our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences -- basically DNA that works in our buildings.
And then we need programmable parts that can accept this sequence and use it for folding or reshaping.
We need some energy to activate, so that our parts can be folded according to procedure.
We need some kind of error redundancy to make sure that what we're building is what we want.
So I'd like to show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I are doing to realize this self-assembly future.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reprogrammable robots -- 8 feet, 12 feet long protein.
They're embedded in electromechanical equipment, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold it into a series of angles -- minus 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, zero degrees, 120 degrees, minus 120 degrees, -- this kind of thing -- a series of angles, or turn it around, which can be passed over by wire.
Each unit gets its own message -- for example, negative 120. It rotates, checks if it's in place and transmits the sequence to its neighbor.
There's a lot of outstanding scientists, engineers, designers working on this project.
I think this project really reveals: Is it really scalable?
I mean, thousands of people spend thousands of dollars making this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed robots in every part of it?
The next question is to look at passivity, or try passively to make reorganization programmable.
But it goes one step further, and it tries to actually calculate.
Basically embedded in the basic construction module of most calculations, the digital logic door, directly into the various parts.
It's with the wrong door.
Each door to be used to calculate has one traverse, and two enter the traverse.
One of them is input from the user, like you're building bricks.
The other one is the input of a brick that was put in before coming.
And then it gives an output of 3-dimensional space.
This means that users build bricks in the way they want.
It's calculated on the basis of what you've done and your instructions.
Now it's moving in three-dimensional space -- up or down.
Look on the left, the input equals zero output, which means down.
On the right, [0,0] input is one output, indicating up.
So what this really means is that our structure now contains the blueprint that we want to build.
So all the information about what you want to build is embedded in it.
It means we have some kind of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-directional reproduction, because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If there's a mistake, you can replace a part.
All local information is embedded in it and tells you how to fix it.
So you have something that you can climb, you can read it and output it one by one.
It's embedded directly; no external instructions entered.
The last project I'm going to show is called the eccentric chain, which is probably the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we're seeing right now.
It's reprogrammable and programmable that makes it a completely passive system.
It's basically you've got a chain of elements.
Every element is identical, and they're partial.
Every chain, or every element wants to turn right or left.
If you want to assemble chains, you need to program them.
Tell each unit to turn left or right.
When you shake this chain, it folds up and programming any structure that you code for it -- so in this case, a spiral, a fire, in this case, two connected cubes.
Basically, you can program in three-dimensional space -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- the chain is completely passive.
What kind of future does this give us?
I think it tells us about the possibility of this self-assembly, self-replicating and self-rehabilitation in our physical structures, our buildings and machines.
There's new programmability in these parts.
From which you can get a new possibility to calculate.
We'll have room to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all the bricks can actually be calculated.
What an amazing parallel and distributed computing power and new design possibilities.
It's an exciting potential.
I think the projects I'm showing you are just a small step towards the future, if we achieve these new technologies for a new self-assembly world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The epidemic's normal, people's sports and fitness are on the rise.
With the gradual liberalization of tourism operations across the provinces, the tourism market is about to recover.
Fujian Province resumed its inter-provincial tourism operations on July 21, and the first weekend after its opening saw a peak in the flow of passengers as a popular destination for tourism.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are a lot of tourists arriving on weekends.
The train station in Xiamen is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer, while the airport traffic is dominated by students, tourism and family visits.
The tourist market has been warming, with 440 daily flights at Xiamen Airport in July, and domestic flights have resumed to 80 per cent of the pre-incident.
The airline encrypted air speed lines in major cities such as Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and seized the recovered tourism market.
At the moment, several travel agencies in Xiamen are running a series of summer trips across the country, mainly on outdoors.
With regard to railway stations, summer passenger peaks at airports, additional mentoring has been done in areas where there is a high concentration of people, such as on-board counters, security corridors, etc., and Fujian has optimized the "Eight Health Codes", which have resulted in the sharing of health data and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, thus contributing to an orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Liu Dehua Liu Qingyun "disable" the new spark-net?
The bomb-dismantling specialist 2 recently announced that it would be released on December 24th as the first film in the greeting slot.
The second one is still director choreographer, producer and lead by Liu De Wa, with a whole new story.
It has been learned that the addition of elements of the "nuclear bomb" in the second section has also made the challenge for the bomb-dismantling experts even more difficult, and that several glimpses in the forecast are already at stake, with a massive explosion of mushroom clouds, an airport engulfed by fire.
Three years ago, the "bomb-dismantling expert" who was made by the originals won the 51st class of ticket winners in the year and won seven nominations for the Hong Kong Film Pictures Award, and Qiu Tao Ziu Dehua became the gold partner in the audience.
This time, the bomb-dismantling expert 2 is again looking forward to a new spark for the ace combination.
"Expert Two" tells a whole new story: former bomb-dismantling expert Pang Hae Feng fainted at the scene of the explosion and was classified by the police as a suspect.
In order to find the truth, he had to turn to his friend, Dong Zhuo, who was also a bomb-dismantling expert.
The female inspector who was anxious to solve the case was also involved in the case of Pang's ex-girlfriend.
It's still a bomb-dismantling expert, but the complexity of Liu's new role can be felt in the premonition: a broken leg, a prosthetic limb, while being hunted by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb-dismantling expert, and being directed by her ex-girlfriend, Nini.
What kind of relationship did Liu De Wa do at the Hong Kong Hotel and what kind of case he's involved in?
It is understood that the most important scenes in the film are the world landmarks in view of Hong Kong, and the top-of-the-art special effects production team, which brings shock and real visual impact.

On July 26, China Newsnet, a comprehensive Russian satellite network reported that July 26 was Russian Navy Day, the main parade to celebrate Naval Day took place in St. Petersburg and Karungstad.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, the top commander of the Russian armed forces, arrived in Kalungstad for the celebration, and 15 ships and submarines were inspected there.
On July 28, 2019, local time, St. Petersburg, Russia, celebrated Naval Day with a grand parade.
Putin reportedly congratulated the Navy on Naval Day and flew on a boat in the Gulf of Finland from the ship that was about to attend the military parade at sea, then inspected the troops at the subjectist stage.
According to Putin, the Russian naval fleet is equipped with state-of-the-art vessels and special equipment, and the level of equipment is constantly increasing.
Putin said in a Russian naval day parade: " The Russian naval fleet has warships equipped with sophisticated weapons, strategic submarines and multi-purpose submarines, aircraft of the latest type, unique weapons and special equipment... "
On June 24th, local time, Russia commemorated the 75th anniversary of the victory in the Patriotic War.
He also stated that the Russian naval fleet would gain its unique advantage through digitization and effective defence.
It was reported that the main naval parade to celebrate Russian Naval Day took place in St. Petersburg and Karungstad, with the participation of 46 ships, including the frigates General Kasatonov, the Navy Lieutenant General Kurakov, and large landing vessels, small missile vessels, frigates, submarines, etc.
Among them, a series of ships performed static displays by the Winter Palace Bridge in St. Petersburg, the most notable of which was the replicated Russian battleship of the early 18th century, the Boltava.
In order to avoid the spread of the new coronary virus, only local residents and special guests will be able to enter Kalangstad during the military parade this year.
The last Sunday of July every year is Russian Navy Day.
The founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, Yang Hong, died in his life at the age of 86 - China New Network.
On July 26th, the Beijing Philharmonic Choir published an obituary by the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, founder of the Beijing Philharmonic Choir, a prominent Chinese leader, music educator, member of the Life Academic Council of the Central Music Academy, and Professor Yang Hong, who died in Beijing on July 26, 2020, at 1355 hours, as a result of the ineffectiveness of medical treatment.
Image from the Beijing Philharmonic Network.
Yang Hong was born in 1934, and the Gang Sunanking people have loved music since childhood.
Commander of the Nanjing People's Radio Choir in 1951, joined the Shanghai Masters Music Department in autumn 1951. The division studied command from Professor Yang Garren and German commander Hizmann, and learned music from former Soviet expert Alzamanov.
In 1958, he was transferred to the Faculty of Music at the Beijing Academy of Arts Teachers, and in 1973 he was transferred to the Department of Concertation at the Central Institute of Music, where he was taught by the Department of Command.
Yang Hong founded the Beijing Philharmonic Choir in 1983.
For more than 30 years, he led this choir to sing all over the world for the purpose of "love and give" and won dozens of grand prizes in important competitions at home and abroad.
He was in charge of more than 30 groups, including the Central Band, the Central National Song and Dance Group, the Orient Song and Dance Group, the Shanghai Choir Group, and held a number of symphony concerts and concerts.
The books are "The Band Training" , "The chorus Training" , "The Two Songs Writing" , "The Children's Singing Collection" , and the the thesis "The chord-level layout of the Orchestra" , as well as the translation of "The chorus Companion" and "The Tweeting Language of Debussy".
Do you know how many flower plants there are?
There are 250,000 -- at least as many as we know -- 250,000 flower plants.
And flowers are trouble.
It's really hard to grow plants.
It takes a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why is it so disturbing?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, sex.
I know what's in your mind when you look at these pictures.
There are many other ways in which plants can reproduce.
It can be implanted; it can reproduce in the same sex; it can pollinate in the same strain.
But they do need to spread their genes and mix them with other genes, so that they can have an ecological environment.
That's how evolution works.
Now the way plants deliver this message is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a scanning microscope that can see these.
There are many species of flowering plants, and there are many different types of pollen.
It's actually very useful for forensics and so on.
It's a very inefficient process, and that's why pollen is always running into our noses.
Because most of them are abandoned, hoping that the reproductive cells contained in pollen, male reproductive cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All the grass, which means all the grain, and most of the trees spread pollen by the wind.
But most species actually use insects to complete the process, which is, in a way, smarter, because it doesn't require too much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen, and move it directly to where it needs to be.
Obviously, we noticed the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship, whether a bird or a bee, and they get a return, usually on nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship leads to amazing adaptive change -- the red dress moth is a beautiful adaptive change.
Plants have been reaping, and cysts have spread pollen elsewhere.
Plants have evolved, creating landing runways everywhere, and bees may be lost.
Many plants have some labels that look like other insects.
These are lilies' pollen capsules, which are very clever, so when the unwitting insect falls on it, the pollen capsule flips over and hits with a lot of pollen on the back of the insect so that it can follow the insects to other plants.
There's a orchid that looks like it's got a jaw. In a way, it does; it forces the insects to climb over, put pollen on, and take the pollen somewhere else.
Orchids: At least 20,000 orchids -- amazingly diverse.
They have all kinds of tricks.
They must try and attract pollinators to help them complete the process.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it was studied by Darwin and made a wonderful prediction when he saw the orchid, and you can see that there's a long nectar tube down from the orchid.
Basically, what insects have to do -- we're in the middle of flowers -- it stabs the mouth in the middle, down the way to find the nectar tube to get the nectar.
Darwin said, "Look at this flower, I guess something has evolved with it. "
No doubt, it's an insect.
I mean, it usually rolls up, but it stretches straight after, and it looks like this.
Now imagine that if nectar, which is so valuable, is very expensive for plants to produce and attract many pollinators, then, as in human sex, people may begin to cheat each other.
They might say, "I have some nectar.
It's a plant.
This plant, which South African insects love, evolved a long mouthpiece to get the nectar at the bottom.
It's a copycat.
This plant is imitating the former plant.
There's a fly with a long mouth, and it doesn't get any nectar from the faker, because the faker doesn't give it any nectar, and it thinks it can get it.
So, not only is the fly not getting nectar from a fake plant, but -- if you look very closely at the top of the head, you'll see some pollen there, which will spread to other plants, if the botanists don't come and stick it to a blue card.
This lie spreads throughout the plant kingdom.
The flowers with black dots: they may look like black dots to us, but I tell you, for the male insects of the right species, it looks like two very, very sexy females.
When the insect arrives and lands on it, it soaks itself into pollen, which, of course, will be taken to other plants, and if you look at the images of a scanning electron microscope that every family should have, you can see some patterns there, three-dimensional patterns.
It even makes insects feel comfortable, and it looks good.
These electron microscope images -- this is a orchid disguised as an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures for our eyes, and that insects may feel very, very different textures.
This orchid evolved to mimic the metallic surfaces seen in some crustacean worms.
Under the scan microscope, you can see the surface -- it's very different from the other surfaces we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics as an insect, even if we look like insects.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It's wonderful and magical.
It's called the Black Rock.
I think it's cunning sometimes.
For the kind of bees that fit, it looks like another very aggressive bee, and it's going to fly over and hit it with its head many times, trying to drive it away, of course, and it's going to put pollen on it.
The other thing it does is this plant imitates another orchid rich in in insect-friendly food.
But there's nothing.
So it cheats on two levels -- incredible.
We're seeing the Elan, the fragrance of the fragrance.
I actually smelled it before.
These flowers don't actually have to be so beautiful.
They give out wonderful scents that attract any interested insects.
This flower doesn't smell so good.
This flower actually smells really bad. Again, it's evolutionary, it looks like rotting meat.
That's why flies like it.
Flies fly in and pollute them.
This is White Star Potato, also known as Dead Horse Potato.
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but this flower may smell very much.
It's horrible.
Green flies can't help themselves.
Fly into it, fly all the way into it.
Laying eggs on it, which is considered to be a very good piece of rotting meat, and not realizing that there is no egg food here, that the eggs will die here, but at the same time the plant will benefit, because the hard hair is loose, the fly disappears, pollinating to another flower -- it's amazing.
It's a sea tarp plant, a sea tart, a zebra, a mother called long-age grass in this country.
I shot this last week in Dosset.
This guy's heating up about 15 degrees higher than the ambient temperature -- incredible.
If you look inside it, there's a bit of a dam behind the ear, and the flies are attracted to heat -- this is a boiling volatile chemical, bugs -- and they're trapped under this container.
They drink sweet nectar and then they all get a little sticky.
At night they're covered with pollen, sprayed by them, and then the hard hair we see on them gets dead and the little pollen bugs get out -- it's incredible.
If you think it's incredible, this one's my favorite.
It's spring feather green.
Anyone here from Brazil should know about this plant.
It's the most amazing thing.
It's brilliant. It's about a foot long.
It has a capability that I know no other plant has, and when it blooms -- it's in the middle of the ear -- for about two days, it produces some kind of metabolic change, some kind of mammal.
It doesn't have starch, it's plant food, it's got very much brown fat, burning it at the speed of fat, metabolism, about the speed of a kitten.
By weight, it's twice the energy output of a hummingbird -- absolutely amazing.
It also did something unusual.
Not only will it warm up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Fahrenheit, two days, but it will keep warm.
One of them has a temperature-regulating mechanism for keeping the temperature constant.
Why would you do that? I heard you ask.
You don't know yet, some beetles like to mate at this temperature.
They're in there, covered in pollen.
Plants fill them with pollen, let them go and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing this is.
Now we think most pollinators are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, because butterflies and birds are similar to us, and we think it's very nice to see red.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue, we see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and UV rays, and they see all kinds of dark UV rays.
There's some color behind this.
"If we could see the colors, wouldn't it be nice?" I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see it.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert lilies, half-day flowers, in Dosset.
As we can see, these are little yellow flowers, all over the place.
It looks like this in visible light.
If you remove the red, it looks like this.
Most bees can't feel the red.
And then I put UV filters in front of my camera, under a specific UV frequency, for a long time, and I got this picture.
It's like a real wonderful target.
Now we don't know what the bees actually see, and when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We don't know what's going on in there, in the insects, in the minds of other humans.
But the contrast seems to be this.
It's another flower -- it's in different UV frequency zones, different filters to match different pollinators.
It looks like this.
In order to avoid you thinking that all yellow flowers have this attribute -- no damage to the flowers during the shoot; just stick it on the tripod, not take it off -- in UV light, look at this.
It's used as a basis for sunscreen, because sunscreen works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe some of the chemicals are useful.
In the end, it was a night comedy sent to me by Bjorn Rorslett of Norway -- a wonderful pattern of concealment.
I like the way it's hidden.
I think it's poetic, and these pictures are taken with ultraviolet filters, the main purpose of which is to be used by astronomers to film Venus -- actually, the clouds on Venus.
That's the main purpose of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and reproduction, which is the word of flowers.
Just as flowers spend so much effort trying to attract pollinators to their invitation, somehow they have succeeded in convincing us that it contains a rich content that we send flowers to each other when we're born and we die, especially at weddings, when you think of it, at this very moment, from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

According to the news released on 26 July by the Chongqing Municipal Development and Reform Commission of China News Network (journalist Liu Xian), 4404 fishermen have been repatriated to date, or 42.54 per cent of all fishermen involved.
53-year-old Li Dynasty, interviewed a Chinese journalist, said that his grandfather had been fishing at the Dragon Creek River since he was 11 years old, and had been fishing with his father, shaking his boat, walking along the Long Creek, going up to Chongqingping, going down to a long life, leaving his home for 10 and a half days each time to feed his family with a fish.
Since 1997, however, as the rural population gradually gushes into the towns, the town of Gao An is increasingly inhabited and the resulting environmental pollution is increasing.
Paper mills, chemical plants, farms, and contaminated water along the Dragon Creek River.
By 2007 and 2008, the Long Creek River had become a ditch.
"The fish scales are black, and they're black when they're open. "
Li Dixon said it's getting harder to catch fish when the water's contaminated.
Local efforts began to address the pollution of the dragon stream, including drifting, river cruises, aquatic resources stewardship, etc.
Li Dynasty has also retrained from fishermen to become a member of the river patrol team to take care of aquatic resources.
As of 1 January 2020, the City of Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and the relevant waters of the main urban area have been completely closed.
According to the Chongqing City Development and Reform Commission, to date, there have been a cumulative number of 3403 retorts in Chongqing city, and 4643 fishing vessels, representing 63.3 per cent and 86.3 per cent, respectively, of the three-year total.
4404 fishermen have been rearrested, or 42.54 per cent of all fishermen involved.
Out of 4,404 repatriated, 4,267 were employed, representing 96.89 per cent of the repatriated fishermen.
Old-age insurance covers 2,691 people, representing 61.10 per cent of the re-arrested fishermen.
As a next step, the city of Chongqing will carry out intensive rehabilitation and rehabilitation activities to speed up the implementation of the Yangtze dry stream project to clean up the Yangtze dry stream, complete a new round of the Yangtze survey and carry out the corresponding clean-up operations, complete the rehabilitation of the three phosphorus (phosphorus mines, phosphorous chemicals and phosphorous plaster banks), clean up small hydropower, promote the greening of the Yangtze coasts, strengthen the construction of the green mines, consolidate the illegal dry stream docks of the Yangtang River, and conduct a special clean-up of the illegal sand harvest, and further the fight against the capture of the Yangtze basin.
Israel ' s Repeated Prevention and Control of the Epidemic - New Network
2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: The Day of Light, by Wang Si-seok, responsible editor: Wang Si-seok
Israel has stepped up its response to the outbreak.
In the early days of the new coronary pneumonia outbreak, the effectiveness of Israel's preventive and control measures was evident.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban and the recent marked rise in the number of new coronary pneumonia diagnoses in Israel, the Israeli Government has taken urgent measures on several occasions to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On 28 February, the first new case of coronary pneumonia was confirmed in Israel proper, with the swift adoption of the closure of all entry/exit points, the suspension of non-essential trades, the conversion of schools to online teaching, restrictions on public transport and non-essential social activities, the closure of cities with severe epidemics, joint military and police protection and control initiatives, etc.
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results, and by mid-May, new single-day confirmed cases of coronary pneumonia in Israel had once returned to single digits.
As the epidemic was brought under control and Israeli controls were completely unsealed, the number of new confirmed cases of coronary pneumonia has gradually rebounded since June.
Especially since July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
More than 1,500 new cases per day in Israel have been reported in recent days, reaching 916 new cases as of 25 July.
As of 25 July, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In the face of the rapid resurgence of the epidemic, the Israeli Government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the control of the epidemic.
On 6 July, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Government of Israel closed its gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment places, and introduced a public transport restriction policy, which requires that no more than 20 passengers per bus be passengers.
On 17 July, the Government announced a series of new restrictions, including the imposition of the "Closure" on weekends, providing for the implementation of the "Closure" between 5 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Friday and Sunday.
During this period, people may go out, but the stores, shopping centres, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while the supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic services will remain open.
At the same time, for all dates and periods, gatherings of more than 10 persons, gymnasiums, studios, etc. will be closed, restaurants and cafés will be prohibited from eating in the canteens and will only be allowed to provide take-out services.
At the same time, the Israeli population has not paid enough attention to the severity of the epidemic and has not been able to work with the Government in combating it.
In the wake of the Israeli outbreak, many people went to the streets to protest against the government's control measures affecting their own economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-immunity policy affected the economy.
In the evening of 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against the ban on restaurants issued by Prime Minister Netanyahu and the lack of commensurate compensation for the security measures such as cafeteria meals.
In addition, many people do not observe the two-metre-safe socialization distance when travelling outdoors, and in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people wear masks only on their chins or on their wrists.
During the recurrent epidemic, schools were the worst affected area for the spread of the new coronary virus, and recent visits by journalists to the kindergarten found that neither kindergarten teachers nor students wore masks as required by the Government, nor maintained a safe social distance of two metres to each other, which exposed a large number of teachers and students to the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, member of the Israeli National Security Council's Expert Advisory Panel to Combat the Epidemic, argued that Israel was moving towards a "dangerous situation", noting that the current Israeli epidemic prevention and control measures were not sufficient and that all leisure, recreational sites and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman stated that Israel lacked an overall plan to combat the epidemic and that Parliament and all branches of government should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach agreement on combating the epidemic and establish clear steps to include relevant restrictions in different sectors.
This newspaper, Tel Aviv, on July 25th, this newspaper's journalist in Tel Aviv, Wang Zhu.
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Ning Chaohara, can't find his companion in Tien Fung, and two men in a car from his home 20 miles away to Liang Yun Cultural Complex.
Despite these two years of discomfort, the 77-year-old DeFront was counting on "Come here in a half-way, get a little bit of fun."
It's a small courtyard in the old city, unlike the general farm yard, where there's always a Qin cavity, and there's a lot of skin scenes, embroidery, traditional Qin cavities, brows.
The owner of the compound was Liang Yun. He was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he loved the shadows, and he started planning to build a cultural complex.
With Liang Yun Cultural Complex, the villagers' cultural life has become rich and diverse.
The journalist hasn't walked into Liang Yun Cultural Camp, and the Qin accent has been transmitted.
It's the neighboring village of Parrisha who sings the Qin section for the folks.
Since she was a child, she's become famous in the area, and if she has some free time, she'll come to the cultural complex to perform for the folks.
Recently, Breitham played live.
"There's a stage where more people can see themselves acting. It's a happy thing."
On the stage, the singer takes a single look, the singer plays a single tune, though amateur, but the enthusiasm is not diminished.
Like the pristine style of the farm house, outside the Qin accent, the roots of the "grass" art and non-past culture in the Liang Yun Cultural Complex.
The compound also contains over 300 pieces of agricultural tools, traditional and handmade tiles, paper cutting, embroidery, leather shadows and so on.
Liang Yun led reporters into the courtyard, showing his old collections, old wine pots, tristrings, spinners, etc.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural complex?
"Skin movies are my home trade, and I've been studying it since I was 15. "
The Liang Yun Cultural Complex was established in 2012 as the first rural "Intangible Cultural Heritage Pavilion" in Ningxia and as a model compound for the preservation of Intangible Cultural Heritage in the solid city.
In addition to the Liang Yun Cultural Complex, the Old State District of Solidahara has more than 120 cultural complexes and 79 private performance groups, including over 50 cultural complexes of a certain size, such as the Shen Jia River Cultural Camp, the Wang Yonghong Cultural Camp, the Yang Long Cultural Camp, etc., covering towns, towns and streets in the Old State District, with over 5,000 participants.
These grasshoppers are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the people and satisfying their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better, traditional culture cannot just be left behind. "
"Liu's Battles" is back again, "The Winners" is watching Yoon Yong Lee's rivals "The Scramble"-Sinhua Network.
The winner of the 40th series will land in Beijing on July 16th.
"The Winner" is based on the true history of the Soviet military archives, which have been in existence for many years.
The actor Yoo Yun Long, well known to the audience, has broken his image in the show and challenged a very happy "Stutter Agent."
In recent years, the "Fake" mask and the "Face kite" show has all proved to be very powerful.
Unlike the old war work, "winner" looks out of the world and extends the background of the story to the Soviet Far East.
In the context of the final phase of the 1944 anti-Japanese war, it tells the story of the Chinese Communist Party secret intelligence worker, Tang Fei, who, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Chinese Underground Party, Lin Ha Province and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carried out the Sioux Far East Intelligence Agency's "Mutengura" plot.
In many battles, the leading man, as a high-ranking spy, is a handsome, intelligent, mature and perfect image.
But in Liu Yun Long's view, a man like that is not a spy, "The spy should be the kind of guy who can't find a place in a pile, and if it's the kind of face that everyone wants to look at you, can you sneak in?" There's a line in the kite, "If you don't catch me, I'll forget that I'm a nationalist."
So in the "winners", Yoo Yun-lung deliberately designed his host Don Fly as a stuttered "executor" with a sense of pleasure.
The other side of the "winner" was backed up by Fuewon, the Japanese and Li Li Gang, the head of the police department, Fong Shibao.
Two powerful actors from the south to the north, adding a lot of good talent to the whole show.
The director Yin Fei used the word "showing" to describe Li Li Li Gang and Liu Yun-lung's rivals, "it's definitely a hot show, and they're very close to each other, and they're very powerful to me, and in many cases they're `fastly', like we write half a page of paper, and I don't stop shooting, and they can continue to do it."
When an actor is in a role and ensures his character's status, he can not only shape the role from a character's point of view, but also give the audience more possibilities to watch.
There were many familiar faces in the "Lew's Wars" show, and when the name of the kite was struck, the "Mountain F4" of the wind came together in the "winner."
I've played Song Xiao An and Zhao Jane Zhou and Liu Nam Yang, and this time I've played Tang Fei's right arm again.
Directed by Yin Fei, "There's nothing wrong with these two people. They're just in that age, and that environment is running around."
Yoo Yun-lone also offered, "We need to have a human face, which means that there must be good and bad people around me, bad people are enemies, but we have to develop them, and our team must grow."
The ending of the show was also carefully designed by Yoo Yun Long, who believed that a satisfactory response would be given to the audience.

Inner Mongolia, 4 students of the Arong flag drowned.
On the evening of July 26th, the Chinese New Network ' s electricity (journalist Lee Ei-Ping) 25th, journalists were informed by the government of the city of Ah Yong-bai in the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia that four students had died as a result of drowning.
On 24 July, at 1550 hours, the Yeung-Chang Public Security Bureau received a report that six junior high school students had drowned.
After taking the call, the local civilian police arrived at the scene and rescued two students on the spot, after which units such as the local emergency department, the water department arrived and participated in the rescue.
It was described that the rescue scene had involved more than 80 people, including police officers, police officers, firefighters, medical personnel, three rubber boats, which continued to search the surrounding waters and hired specialized rescue teams to arrive at the scene and conduct underwater searches through sonar detection.
The journalists learned that the local rescue workers found the first student in distress on 25 July at 0640 hours, the second student in distress at 1130 hours on 25 July, the third student in distress at 1240 hours on 25 July, the last student in distress at 1334 hours on 25 July, and the four above-mentioned individuals, who were taken to shore, were identified by the local emergency centre at 120 hours as having no vital signs.
According to the authorities, the drowning was a wake-up call for the whole community.
At present, the relevant local authorities are putting together some knowledge of the prevention of drowning in the hope that the tragedy will not happen again.
Hong Kong, Xinhua News Agency, July 25, Hong Kong, Hong Kong government chief of finance and treasury, Xu Jung Woo, stated that Hong Kong's financial markets remained active and well-functioning.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong’s financial stability and economy.
Xu Jong-woo, at an online seminar organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce (Hong Kong General Council) on 24 (Toronto Time), stated that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation as a result of the "Student Wave" and the New Crown Pneumonia outbreak.
Hong Kong dollar exchange rates are stable and tend to favour the level of the strong exchange guarantee.
There are no clear signs of financial outflows in the banking system, but, on the contrary, more than $11 billion has been flowing since June.
Bank deposits have also continued to increase over the past few months, with a series of open equity fund-raising activities in the stock market, and the market has been on the rise.
According to Xu Jong-woo, the new coronary pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's fundamental advantage remains unchanged.
Hong Kong ' s many strengths, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, the free flow of information and capital, and a simple low-tax system, continue to make Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
According to Xu Jong-woo, the HKSAR Government has set aside HK$ 6 billion for the Anti-Infectious Disease Fund to create approximately 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering people with different skills and qualifications.
To support the development of financial science and technology, the HKSAR Government has also launched the "Ten Thousand Plan" to fund local finance and technology companies, start-up and other enterprises with financial science and technology-related business, in order to create 1,000 new jobs, employ local talent and enrich Hong Kong's financial science and technology pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Jong-woo is optimistic about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to take advantage of Hong Kong's strengths and its position as an international financial centre, an international centre for asset and wealth management and a global offshore currency business hub to develop and invest in the Bay of Hong Kong and its surroundings.
"The Lancet" praises China's efforts to combat the disease and encourages countries to learn from the experience of China.
According to the 25th Journal of The Lancet, China, a country of 1.4 billion people of similar size to Europe or the United States, at this stage, the new coronary epidemic is effectively controlled without any further widespread transmission, largely controlling the epidemic in the country.
According to the article, China has invested heavily in research and public health construction in the country for more than a decade, making it much more prepared for the new crown than it was for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of that year.
According to the author, at the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially under-prepared, especially since the pathogen was uncertain.
When the new coronary virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus, and on January 11, 2020 they shared genomic sequence data with the international community.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had spelled out the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of the new coronary virus through a research paper published on the Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, which has been carried out very quickly and strictly through close cooperation within the country under the state of emergency. In May and July, respectively, the results of the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China were published on the "Yujit".
China ' s experience has shown that it is important to invest in national health and research systems and to improve laboratory capacity effectively.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are very worthy of learning and learning.
Moreover, the Chinese experience has shown that, on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level and decisive scientific basis for sound decision-making, which will enable the new coronary epidemic to be effectively controlled.
The article stressed that Governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its value and act on it in the best way for society.
In the early days of the outbreak, the Chinese National Guard commissioned three groups of infectious disease specialists to travel to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new crown virus, whose recommendations informed the decision of the Wuhan "Closure" of January 23rd; the decision of the Government was quickly taken and implemented as soon as the experts suggested the necessity and urgency of building the square-hub hospital; and the wide participation of the community and the population led to the rapid and effective control of the epidemic.
The article concludes by emphasizing the need for countries to strengthen global cooperation and joint responses to global health emergencies.

The former inspector of the Uhai City Council of the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, Buckinghai, was expelled from the Party - China New Network
On July 26, Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-American Network, according to information received from the Board of Supervision of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region: a case was recently opened by the Board of Supervision of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with the approval of the Party of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, to investigate the serious violations of discipline committed by the former inspector of the Uhai City Council, Buckinghai.
It has been found that Buckingham, as a party leader, lost his ideal convictions and openly violated the principle of partyism by opposing inspection and reform; that his organization was indifferent, that he did not arrange for the transfer of jobs for others and that he received other people ' s belongings in the selection and appointment of his cadres; that he was economically greedy, that he did bad business in order to gain huge profits, that he traded in power, and that his life was corrupted.
The Platinum Sea is a serious violation of political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, life discipline, which constitutes a breach of duty and is suspected of bribery, corruption, and is not allowed to recuperate after the 18th anniversary of the party, is of such a serious nature that it should be seriously addressed.
In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Regulation on Disciplinary Action by the Communist Party of China, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Monitoring, which was considered by the Standing Committee of the Internal Mongolian Autonomous Region and reported to the Standing Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for approval, the decision was taken to impose a penalty for expulsion from the Platinum Sea and to adjust the treatment to which he was entitled; to seize the proceeds of his disciplinary offences; and to refer him to the Public Prosecutor's Office for legal review and prosecution in accordance with the law.
At 25 p.m. local time, a small plane crashed into the top of a multi-storey residential building in Wessel County, North Wales, Germany, killing three people.
The Duisburg prosecution, the Weather County Police Department and the Fire Department of the city of Wessel issued a joint statement the same night stating that at about 1440 hours on the same day, two small aircraft crashed into a multi-storey residential loft on Phoebus Camp Street in Wessel County, killing three people.
He took off the same day from the city of Mal, Ruhr, North Wales, and then took off again after midway to the airport in Wessel County, then hit a residential building.
The victim's identity or a female household member and two passengers on a small plane in the house that was hit.
A 2-year-old in the room was only slightly injured and safely rescued.
The rest of the house was not injured in the accident, but the mood was still not recovered.
The live footage reported by Deutsche Presse shows that the houses that were hit by the accident were once smoked and that firefighters were able to see the damage.
At the moment, the cause of the plane crash is unclear.
The Rhine Post quoted police reports that there were leads to the breakdown of the plane or before it crashed into a residential building.
The police said they found multiple pieces of spare parts for the crash at the scene of the accident.
The German criminal police are investigating the cause of the accident with the Duisburg prosecution, the German Federal Aeronautical Accident Investigation Agency.
The same day, journalists learned from the Chinese Consulate-General in Düsseldorf that it had contacted the local police and fire department and that, according to the scene, none of the casualties had been Chinese citizens.
The Ministry of Health announced on 26th of the same day that 481 new confirmed cases had been diagnosed in Singapore, with a cumulative total of 50369; 27 cumulative deaths.
According to the data, of the new confirmed cases, five were local community cases, four were imported cases and the rest were foreign workers living in specialized accommodations.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore states that 98 per cent of new confirmed cases are related to known infections.
There are still 173 new crown patients in the hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, and no one is in intensive care.
In addition, 4648 people are isolated in community facilities.
Foreign workers account for the vast majority of new crown infections in Singapore.
According to statistics, there are 200,000 foreign workers living in 43 special accommodations for foreign workers and about 100,000 foreign workers living in other types of accommodations.
The Interdepartmental Working Group on the Fight against AIDS in Singapore has recently indicated that the Singapore Government is stepping up testing for the last few dedicated accommodations for foreign workers with high crown infection rates.
Upon completion of testing in all dedicated accommodations, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work, but they will still be required to conduct new crown tests on a regular basis.
Da Peng's "Grateful" is in the Golden Lord's Award.
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official selection of the Golden Lord Prize.
Director Tai Peng's first reality film, "Good luck" was successful in winning the Golden Lord Award for this festival, while the film officially launched the first poster.
Posters, tablets.
The film, "Good luck" was the first realistic piece of the film by the director, and the second match he had with the Golden Lord's Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who came back to his home in the Northeast countryside, hoping to turn his family into a literary film for the rest of the year, and suffered a series of accidents.
Members of the family who came together for the film, finished the final party.
In today's film poster, one of the family members, Uncle Wang, sits in the middle of the picture smoking cigarettes in the northeast black land with silver on it, with the prospect of the Chinese wearing red lanterns for the holidays.
The red lantern that symbolizes the celebration, the red lantern that unites, and the king who falls in the shadows, are a huge contrast, and seem to reveal the complexity and the intricacies of this extended family relationship.
According to the video, except for Uncle Wang's daughter, who was played by actor Liu Lui, the rest was done by the real director's family, the video's experimental audio-visual style, which broke the theatre and the real boundary and brought a new insulated visual experience to the audience.
According to the director Tai Po, the creation of "grateful" came out of a "benevolent nature" when families suddenly changed their original plans, and life without scripts was eventually recorded as a film, but released tension that went beyond design.
How can the director of Tai Peng face this fate, and how can he continue to embrace the changes that it has brought?
There is no doubt that "grateful" is experimental, and almost all-embracing formations and innovative audio-visual styles turn life in front of the camera into a film, and, under the cover of real images, the audience will also find a shadow of themselves and their families in the family that comes out of the film, and that a series of thoughts will be inspired by the end of this family gathering.
NEWS.GOV.MO: Statistics on the reference hotline of the new coronary virus infection response centre (25 July 08H00-26 July 08H00)
From 08H00 on 25/07/20 to 08H00 on 26/07/07/20, a total of 292 calls were received by the hotline of the New Coronary Virus Infection Response Coordination Centre.
With regard to 291 queries on the epidemic, immediate follow-up was provided to representatives of the relevant departments, as follows:
271 (regarding: inquiries on quarantine; inquiries on nucleic acid tests; inquiries on two plates; health codes; other)
17 Security Police stations (regarding: measures to search for entry/exit; measures to search for entry/exit of vehicles with registration plates on both sides of the border; search for the Pearl Sea Government Hotline; search for documents for stay...)
1 in the Tourist Board (regarding: searching for isolated hotels.)
1 in Education and Youth Department (regarding: searching for ways to return Macao students to study in the United Kingdom.)
1 to the Maritime and Water Authority (regarding: Questioning whether Hong Kong fishing vessels are required to report to the Maritime and Water Authority and about the detection of nucleic acids.)
Bartho Dracon, platoon Yuwang and a soldier on duty.
At this point in the year, where the average temperature is less than 10 degrees, a line of simple barracks is standing at the hillside, not far from which a flag flies, and soldiers are stationed in the wind on a daily basis, while regular patrols are made to higher altitudes.
The warriors climb up the rocky slopes and use both hands and feet.
In late July, it was when the grass was growing in the low altitude, and in Bako Drecon, there was only relatively dense green in the gutter behind the barracks.
The warriors who had been stationed at that outpost for six years pointed to the ravine and said that this was their back garden, and that only in July and August of each year could we see the grass grow slowly, and soon all turned yellow and covered with snow.
On foot, it could take about nine hours.
In the harsh highlands, the soldiers who were stationed there were always accompanied by snow mountains and glaciers, and they were regularly patrolling the mountains at higher altitudes.
A patrol consisting of eight soldiers, led by a mentor, Liang Siam, took another patrol road.
Each soldier weighs about 30 pounds, heading towards the target point early in the morning.
A soldier on his way to war. He's got an emergency rescue.
In addition to the patrols, the soldiers at the Barto Dracon outpost conduct tactical and physical training on a daily basis.
The passage of time, rising altitude, low oxygen levels and overstretched physical strength test the willingness of the patrolmen.
They're gnawing their teeth, and then they're crossing a couple of landslides, and they're crossing a couple of crash beaches.
At about 1600 hours, the patrol crews took their own dry rations and sat there at an altitude of more than 5,700 metres, accompanied by rain and snow, to supplement their strength with food.
The warriors at Bartho Dracon's post have tactical and physical training.
During the break, they play cards together, losers have to push-ups, entertain and exercise.
After a short break in the cold, they climbed into the position of the patrol's target point, raised a flag at the mountain entrance, and made a solemn declaration.
Behind them is Mount Mamar. They're thousands of miles ahead of us. They're the safest keepers of the country's gates.
Beijing consumption season restart - Xinhua Network
Beijing City recommences its activities for the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principles of "full re-launching, focused planning, orderly advancement and close organization".
On July 26th, 1.5 million government coupons were issued, including 1 million underline food and catering coupons, 500,000 smart-product coupons for consumers to receive from the Kyoto AP.
Liu Mayying, Deputy Director of the Beijing Business Bureau, presented at a press conference held in Beijing on 25 March that the renewed consumption season would further reduce enterprise ration based on maintaining the existing level of preferential subsidies for consumer coupons.
From the beginning of August, the current Government and enterprise funding was adjusted from 1:1 to 2:1, i.e., if the original consumer received a card to the shop, he would receive a discount of $120, of which $60 was subsidized by the Government and $60 by the enterprise; and $80 by the adjusted Government and $40 by the enterprise.
During the consumption season, the three main operators will subsidize flows and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting 5G new infrastructure in Beijing and 5G new consumption.
Chen Maobo means that Hong Kong's economy has been hit again by the outbreak.
Hong Kong, China News Agency, July 26, Chen Mobo, Director of Finance of the Hong Kong SAR Government, stated on July 26 that Hong Kong was facing a new wave of new coronary pneumonia that had hit its business and economic activities, which had seen a slight recovery.
The HKSAR government has reiterated its call to owners, both large and small, to reduce their rents and to work with retailers and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article online on the same day, entitled "The Crouching Path to Recovery".
According to him, the recent high number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Hong Kong is a serious one, affecting the livelihood of the community and plaguing the economy.
In case of repeated outbreaks, first and foremost, it is critical to secure the entry case and to treat and disrupt the chain of transmission of the virus as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is under control, economic activity should resume accordingly in due course.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new epidemic, commercial transactions and economic activity, which had seen a slight recovery, had also been hit.
Social responsibility is equally important for the business community, beyond the contractual spirit, especially for groups that receive large government subsidies under the Job Security Scheme.
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong remained critical in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to have slowed slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that the external situation in Hong Kong is still critical.
According to Chen Mobo, Hong Kong ' s development history over the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
A winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I drove to work, I found the city covered in fog.
I drive through there almost every day, but this time it's unusual, and I've never seen anything like it before.
Johannesburg was famous for its uniquely beautiful antenna, but it was almost invisible that morning.
And soon I realized that what I saw was a serious haze caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment that I knew in the old days and the cloudy skylines of the moment, is raging in my heart.
I'm afraid it's very likely that the once coloured sunset beauty will be swallowed up by the dark fog.
At that moment, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is I can't just stand by.
The biggest challenge is, I don't know about environmental science, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm pretty sure I can't solve atmospheric pollution by coding.
What will I do to solve this problem?
I'm just a small man in the city.
In the next few years, I've learned a very important lesson, and if we want a better future, we should all keep it in mind.
Even if you're not an expert in a particular field, your expertise may have a way of solving problems in that field.
Sometimes, the unique perspective that you have can inspire unconventional thinking to shape the situation, but you need to try.
That's the only way you'll know what's going on.
All I knew at the time was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about the contamination, so I was a student again.
I did some basic research, and soon I realized that atmospheric pollution was the biggest environmental health risk in the world.
According to the World Health Organization, in 2012, almost 14 per cent of deaths worldwide were caused by air pollution in and around households, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
Atmospheric pollution causes a higher mortality rate than malaria and AIDS each year.
In Africa, premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation, or deaths due to malnutrition of children, appear pale in the face of atmospheric pollution, with huge economic costs: According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, expenditure in 2013 exceeded $400 billion.
In my work, I'm looking at the technological frontier of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, finding a useful foothold and helping us make better decisions.
When I think about the problem of atmospheric pollution, things become clear about how to deal with it, and we need to find better ways to make better decisions, given the magnitude of the problem, and it's very necessary to work together.
So I decided to meet some people who work in this field.
I started talking to officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I made some calls to people who were completely strangers but concerned.
These experiences of my involvement have helped me to understand this more deeply.
And it helped me avoid the trap that sometimes falls when people in my profession try to innovate: fast-track a technology before they really know the problem.
I'm starting to think, what can I do to improve this situation?
I started asking myself, how to effectively integrate my knowledge skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the professional skills of the people I'm talking to.
I'd like to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends, to make predictions about what might happen.
I'm sure my ideas can be a realistic solution, but I'm also faced with uncertainty, and I can't guarantee it's going to work.
All I've got is a set of specific engineers' skills, the skills I've gained from my work. And of course, for people who have been working in the field of atmospheric pollution for years, my skills are completely new.
I've come to realize that sometimes a new perspective, a new skill set, can trigger something extraordinary.
Our will and imagination are a beacon that tells us to cross the barrier and start a new chapter.
I had a deeper understanding of the problem of atmospheric pollution, looking for data on atmospheric pollution over the last decade or so, and on and around Johannesburg, and then I worked with colleagues from South Africa and China to create air quality resolution support systems and upload them to the clouds.
This software can analyze historical and real-time data to reveal the trends of pollution over time and space.
We then learned technology with a new machine and predicted future contamination days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their daily journey and where they settle with their families.
We can anticipate adverse pollution events in advance, define the sources of heavy pollution, and allow the authorities to direct their operations.
Through complementary scenario planning, city planners can also make better decisions about how to expand infrastructure work, such as housing in industrial zones.
We've built a pilot pilot on this technology, running for 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
Our expected results have been validated, and the prediction data that we're showing and the data we're collecting in the field show a strong correlation.
Through our management, we introduced the world ' s leading cutting-edge instrument to predict atmospheric mass, its resolution and correctness as never before, so that the city that I drove into in the early winter morning could benefit... when I said to myself, "Something's wrong, I have to do something."
So the point is, what if I didn't study the problem of atmospheric pollution in the first place?
What if I don't care about the state of the country's environment, but I'm hoping that somewhere else, and some other people are in charge of this?
What I learned from this is that it's important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequences of inaction as we move forward with a cause that we all believe in.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should inspire us to go further.
So whatever part of the world you're in, next time, when you find out that you're born with some kind of curiosity that's aroused, and it's also about what you're thinking, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if it's not your field of expertise, ask yourself, why don't you try it?
Why don't you come straight to the problem and do your best, in your own way?
Maybe you'll have an unexpected pleasure.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The biggest earthquake in Taiwan's eastern waters this year - the new Chinanet.
On July 26th, Chinese news agency Taipei wired an earthquake at 20:52 a.m. on July 26th on the eastern coast of Taiwan, with a magnitude of 6.1 on the Richter scale, with a shock rate of 4 on the top of the station, which is the largest earthquake in the country this year.
Media outlets such as China Times Electronics, ETtoday News Cloud, reported that the earthquake hit 86.5 km south-east of the Ilan County Government, that is, the eastern sea area of Taiwan, at a depth of 53 km.
The Chinese seismological network determined the earthquake to be 5.5.
The biggest shock in the whole station is at level 4 in Flower Lotus County, level 4 in Yilan County, county in Taidong, district in Nandu County, level 3 in Yunlin County, and other counties and municipalities have measured levels 1 to 2.
According to the Taiwan Meteorological Department, the earthquake was the largest in the country since this year, with a non-banded earthquake at the boundary of the plate, which was frequented in the past and active since this year.
In the next week, it's still not clear that there are aftershocks above level 4.
A lot of people think driving is something that can only be done by those who can see.
Blind people want to drive a car safely and alone until now, it's considered impossible.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we built a car for the freedom and independence of blind people for people with visual impairments.
Before I talk about this blind car, let me briefly say another project I've ever done, called the U.S. Department of Defense Senior Research and Planning's City Challenge.
It's about making a mechanical car that can drive on its own.
You press the start button, don't touch anything, it can reach its destination completely automatically.
In the 2007 Challenge, our team won half a million dollars to win third place in the game.
Around that time, the National Association of the Blind, or the Blind Association, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would allow blind people to drive independently and safely.
We thought we'd try it, because we thought, hey, it's gonna be hard.
We already have an automatic car.
All we have to do is let the blind drive inside, and that's it, right?
But we're wrong.
What the blind association wants is not a car that can walk around blind people, but a car that blind people can choose and manage.
So we had to give up everything we had to do from the beginning.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a small sand cart prototype to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited a lot of blind young people across the country and gave them a chance to take the car for a ride.
It's definitely a beautiful experience.
But the problem with this car is that it's designed to drive blind people in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot -- even on a small road made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take the next important step, to create a real car that could drive on the real road.
How does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complicated system, but let me explain, let me simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have a sensory phase, a computational phase and a non-visual interface.
The pilot is obviously invisible, so the system must be able to sense the surroundings and collect data for the driver.
In this case, we use the initial measurement element.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like human ears, inner ears.
I combined this information and GPS to predict the location of the vehicle.
We've also used two cameras to detect the path of the car.
We also use three laser rangers.
Laser scanning environments to detect obstacles -- front, back-to-back vehicles, and any obstacles on the way in, around the vehicle.
All the big information goes back to the computer, and the computer does two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the environment -- which is the path, which is the barrier -- and translate it to the driver.
The system is also very intelligent to calculate the safest path.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the vehicle's running procedures.
But the question is, how do we get the information and instructions to go fast and accurate enough for the blind to make sure he can drive?
To that end, we've designed a number of different non-visual user interfaces.
The initial 3-D flat sound system, vibrating vests, acoustic gears, leg belts, even shoes that press their feet.
But today we're talking about three of these non-visual user interfaces.
The first interface is called the driver's handle.
It's a pair of gloves, and it has vibrating elements in the finger section so that you can transmit instructions on how to move -- direction and range.
The other device is called the speed belt.
This chair -- actually, it's a massage chair.
We take it apart, we reassemble the vibrations in different modes, we get them to transmit the speed information, and we have instructions on how to use the gas doors and brakes.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the surroundings... because you can't see the vibrations, we actually have a red luminous diode on the pilot, so he can see what's happening.
It's sensor data, it's transferred from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, the handle and the speed belt, are very effective.
But the problem is, these are signal devices.
So that's not really freedom, is it?
Computer tells you how to drive -- left, right, speed, brake.
I call it a co-pilot problem.
So we're avoiding signaling devices, and focusing more on information devices.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called an empty map.
Look at this as a blind monitor.
It's a small desktop, with holes on it, and compressed air is removed from it, so it can be depicted as a picture.
So even if you're blind, you put your hand on it, you can sense the path and the obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency of air releases, possibly the temperature.
It's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here, you can see left, right and right cameras and how the computer interprets and transmits this information to the blanks.
That's it, we're showing a simulation, a blind man driving with an empty map.
This program has been very helpful in training blind drivers and fast testing different theories based on different types of non-visual user interfaces.
That's how it basically works.
But this car is a model car, and it's not going anywhere unless it turns out to be as safe as today's car, or safer.
I'm sure it's gonna happen.
But do societies, do they accept this radical idea?
What are we going to do with insurance?
How will we issue a driver's license?
There are many different obstacles behind the technological challenge that we need to address before it really becomes a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car driven by blind people.
But what's potentially more important than that is the enormous value of the by-products of this project.
Sensors that can see the dark, the rain fog.
And this new type of interface, we can use these technologies to make them safer vehicles for the visual population.
Or, for the blind, a daily household device -- an educational facility, an office application service.
Imagine the teacher writing notes on the blackboard in the classroom, and blind students can use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher wrote.
It's extremely precious.
Today, what I'm showing you is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Malinichev said that the change in value was influenced by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
He said, "The cost of services is increasing.
People are starting to spend more time on the Internet as a result of the epidemic ... "
Malinichev does not rule out a serious rise in the price of the Internet each year, arguing that operators can provide customers with more speed and more services to counter grievances over the price increase.
"Doctors of China" to honor the anti-fouling hero Xinhua.
Recently, in recognition of the Chinese filmmaker's hero in the fight against the disease, the director of the Boone Film Company, Liu Weiqiang (Tu Zhou) in Guangzhou and the Zhongnanshan Academy, spoke about the production of the film "Doctor of China" against the disease.
The Boone industry wishes to pay tribute to the Chinese doctor for all the medical workers who fought in the first line of the epidemic!
In 2021, the film will be made public as a national presentation to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party.
At the moment, the Bona Film Industry is being deployed under the auspices of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau, under the auspices of the Chinese Captain and the Chinese Medical Doctor, a film that reflects the strong leadership of the Party's central leadership and that unites the people of the country to fight the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The film focuses on the fight against the disease in the context of Wuhan medical personnel and the provincial and municipal medical teams, using unique narratives from a human perspective, as well as extremely powerful camera language, to show the moving story of Chinese medical personnel who are dedicated and sacrificed in the fight against the disease.
It is understood that, at the first hour of Wuhan's release, the company managed to overcome its difficulties by dispatching a team to meet hundreds of health workers in front of each other and to gather information. Interviews have been made with the first person in Guangzhou to assist Wuhan, the first person in Guangzhou to assist Wuhan, the medical team in Guangdong, the hospital in Wuhan, the hospital in Wuhan, the hospital at Wuhan University, the central hospital in Wuhan, and the first-hand white-clothing angels on the front line of the epidemic.
In this symposium, the Zhongnan Mountain Academy also expressed its expectations and hopes for the film production: " I look forward to seeing not only some of the more visible experts, but also more of the medical personnel who are suffering at the front line, most of them. "
He said he'd seen "Me and my motherland, the Chinese captain" before, and thought it would be a good way to tell the big story from a common man's perspective.
"There is still some misunderstanding of China by some foreign friends. "
When it comes to the spread of the film, the Zhongnan Yamasa say that there are people outside the country who like to label the virus as politicized, and he hopes that the film will impress the audience from a human perspective: " It would be better to show the film abroad, in addition to China, in a way that can be understood by the audience at home and abroad, and in a true human spirit. "
In the 1980s, the film "Man to Middle Ages" was remembered with great affection, "Man to Middle Ages" after so many years, when my friends from abroad were crying, and it would have been amazing if the Chinese doctor had been able to do that."
The Zhongnan Shan School says that if the Chinese doctor can resonate with the audience abroad, it will be a great success.
During the conversation, the Zhongnan Mountain Academy also shared its views and recommendations on the current international epidemic, "I believe that people are always smarter than the virus. "
According to Zhongnan Shan, although the virus is unpredictable, humans have so far been at great risk from the primordial societies, and today there are developed medical, technological and social management measures in modern societies, together with a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new coronary pneumonia epidemic among the world's medical staff and even the general public, and people will not be as passive as they were before.

The Mandarin Mandarin's first Red Bott meeting.
Henan Daily News, Xin Hunan client reporter Jiang Wei, correspondent, Shaw Yan
On July 25th, the Festival of the Red Tourist Culture of Lake 2020 opened in Xingshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Red Cultural Industry Fair was held at the Global Tourism Advisory and Distribution Centre in Sasayama.
The red creative products of the exhibition area, the Tut products of the old revolutionary district, and so on, brought tourists from all over the country to fight for them.
" The Red Expo is a national demonstration of the achievements of the red culture industry and an important platform for participants and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths ... "
A presentation was made by the head of the Executive Committee of the first Red Chamber of the Red Sea on the theme "The Red Culture Booster Brigade." The exhibition covered almost 3,000 square metres, setting up an atmosphere-building area, and displaying an exhibition area and a network of Red Letters.
Zhejiang Ka Xing, Guizhou abided, Shaanxi Yanan and my provincial governors Sha, Jizhou, Yuyang, Changzhou, etc., were invited to 137 enterprises, units and exhibitions to exhibit 768 exhibits, including red artifacts, crafts, food specialty, tourist routes, red training courses, red creative products, etc.
The exhibition area will be on display until July 29.
As the host of the Red Fair, the bright spots of the show were on the rise.
According to the head of the exhibition area, the exhibition is divided into the red industry and the red cultural industry is developed in two major sectors.
The red industrial exhibit displays 31 items from six enterprises, including the Wahlin steel, the Wahlin cable and the electric power, and the red book series, the red food series, the red art series, and the red series of creative products.
A lot of tourists in the Yon-Aan area are attracted to the display of flower handicrafts and paper-cutting art.
The director of the Jian'an City Department of Civil Affairs, Madang Poe, described the demonstration as a careful selection of the best red creative products in Yen'an for almost two years, 16 of which are excellent works of 2019 national red originals.
At the same time, they invited the National Intangible Cultural Heritage Conservation Project, "Anse Paper Cut", and the "Shot North Song" and the provincial non-remain project Yanchuan Painters to focus on the Yonan Folklore feature products and to use this opportunity to communicate with enterprises in other exhibition areas to promote cross-regional cooperation.
The cumulative number of new confirmed cases in Japan exceeds 30,000 - Xinhua Network
According to statistics, 239 new confirmed cases were registered in Tokyo on 26th day, and more than 200 new cases were registered on a single day of six days, reaching a cumulative total of 11114.
In addition, 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka, 90 new cases in Fukuoka County and 80 new cases in Aichi County.
In the first half of the year, the number of fraud crimes committed by telecommunications networks increased by 70%.
In the first half of this year, the National Public Prosecution Service prosecuted 58101 people for fraud, an increase of 35 per cent over the previous year.
In particular, fraud offences are more prevalent among epidemic-preventive offences, and prosecution of fraud offences accounts for 43.4 per cent of all cases of fraud-preventive offences.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has conducted targeted guidance and has published a total of 9 cases involving fraud in 10 typical cases of disease prevention and control.
In the first half of the year, the Public Prosecution Service conducted a wide variety of cases involving fraud offences, ranging from national macro-policies to the food and clothing industry, including epidemic-related fraud, medical-care fraud, health-care fraud, recruitment-broker fraud, hedge-lending fraud, State subsidy fraud, unfreezing of national assets, etc., to ongoing "news" involving education, medical care, employment, old-age, social security, land demolitions, accurate poverty alleviation, financial credit, etc., which not only caused economic damage to the victims, but also seriously affected economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications networks defraud across national borders, geographical and human constraints, with mass, cross-border, remote, e-payment and other characteristics, have a large number of non-specific groups of victims and are highly harmful.
For example, the creation of specialized companies, the rental of high-grade writing buildings, the creation of multiple departments or posts, the use of legal web platforms for advocacy, recruitment, training and appraisal of recruitment staff, the introduction of business models for management, the wearing of "legitimate clothes" and greater confusion.
It is incumbent upon the prosecution authorities to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to provide timely warning to the public and to the authorities concerned.
In the administration of justice, the Public Prosecution Service has taken a serious role in maintaining a high level of pressure on fraud offences, as well as tailoring law enforcement initiatives to promote social governance through, inter alia, the issuance of prosecutorial recommendations.
The Public Prosecution Service has made clear the factual aspects of arrest, prosecution of fraud cases, evidence, procedural and legal application, based on the facts and subject to the law, in order to be impartial.
In particular, with regard to the crime of telecommunication network fraud, focusing on the central role of electronic data in the determination of facts, efforts to construct electronic data, evidence of words, and a chain of evidence between documentary evidence.
In the case of a case of fraud committed by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Nimba County in Zhejiang province, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office intervened early in the first five days from the time the case occurred to its conclusion, reflecting a fast-tracking attitude and determination to maintain stability in society.
In reviewing the arrest and prosecution chain, focusing on the prosecution of missing persons in the case, correcting the arrest of 733 persons by the public security organs, and in reviewing the prosecution of 1113 persons by the public security organs.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecution Service issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations on fraud offences, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud and promote deeper governance.
For example, in response to deficiencies in the regulation of telecommunications networks in communications enterprises, banks, intermediaries and others identified in the case, the Guangzhou City Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Guangdong Province and the East Chang City Public Prosecutor ' s Office issued timely inspection recommendations urging the units concerned to strengthen their supervision and improve their mechanisms to help build a long-lasting system.
Four is full-time recovery work.
The local prosecution authorities have seized the key elements of intervention in the investigation leading to the taking of evidence, examined the prosecution, and urged the investigating authorities to actively pursue the proceeds, cooperate with the authorities in the recovery of the proceeds, and endeavour to minimize the economic damage caused to the population by the fraud offences.
As in the case of a certain set of road loans by the Beijing Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office, which involved 22 housing units waiting to be seized, a "suspension letter" was first issued where the property might be disposed of in other cases, and was sent to the relevant court in a timely manner, recommending that the previously seized court suspend the execution of the property in question, pending the establishment of the facts of the crime, and that it should be dealt with in a uniform manner, with a view to making the best effort to recover the property in question and recover the damage to the victim.
The prosecutor reminds you of the need to be very vigilant about fraud, not to count on the sky to drop pies, and not to believe in your money bag as cheap.
Jinna Town, Weining County, Guizhou: Short apple tree, wide poverty path - new net.
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Network
Summer inflammation, economics daily, Chinese economic network journalists walked into the town of China Sea in Winning County, Guizhou.
In the middle of the sun, the villagers, Li Won-zheng, snuffed in the base, tanned in red, but they used to hum in their mouths at times.
In Winning County, where the town is located, it has a low latitude, high altitude, abundant light, high day and night temperature, high sugar content and good taste, and has a certain visibility in the surrounding area, but because of its small head and its many spots, it has not been able to sell a good price, and it has not been able to form the size of the industry.
The town of Luna was a poor town with a high incidence of poverty of 25.8 per cent 10 years ago.
In the critical period of the fight against poverty, changing traditional farming practices, restructuring industries and increasing farmers' incomes are imminent.
After many visits by the Party Secretary Chen and a group of people in the town of Chennai, it was felt that industrial development could no longer follow the same path.
To that end, the town of Chennai introduced the lead company to grow apples in a modern way.
Weining, Deputy Director-General of Agriculture, Inc., traveled from Shaanxi to Chennai town in 2015 to study local conditions for planting, starting in 2016, to plant apple trees locally.
At first, the village mobilized Lee Yuan Zhong to send the land out to plant apple trees, and the couple made a big mistake: "For so many years, they have grown apples and no one in the village has grown apples. "
"All the apples we grow are dwarfed apples. They don't grow too tall. "
What Li won't realize is that this apple planting is taking a new approach, irrigation pipes are laid under every apple tree, water and fertilizer are poured into the roots, and when the fall harvests, the tractor drives straight into the orchard and can pick the fruit standing up.
Now, Apple Base has come into production, and the market, as envisaged by Huo, is not apologizing for apples, which are very popular with consumers in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc.
The growing apple industry has brought about a new change in Lee's life and, although still growing, a new source of income.
The Lee Yuan Zhong family has transferred more than nine acres of land to Apple Base, and each year, in addition to securing the price of land flow, there is a profit-sharing bonus after the hysteria. The couple usually work in the base, "$80 a day for each of us, and work is done all the time."
Lee won't forget to tell the reporters that last year's profit-sharing was over 2,800, plus land-flowing fees and the income of the couple's workers, and the family's income was over 80,000.
"Accountable results have now been achieved, with an acre of apples producing more than $15,000 a year, about 10 times the value of corn. "
Chen told reporters that the town is now growing 20,000 acres of apples, 6,000 acres in the village of China Sea alone, covering 4056 farmers and 172,000 people, of whom 656 are poor and 2,952 are paid more than $6 million a year, making it possible to build a base in front of the home and work without going outside.
LEE Won-zhong, who's getting more and more busy, is beginning to fulfill his wish.
This year, Lee won't buy a Land Cruiser like today's day in a car, "There's more than a dozen acres of land in the house, and the next time Apple Base expands, it's all flowing to them, it's more income."

Map of new hybrid base-mass membrane preparation techniques
Reporter Swe reported that recently, the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team of Tianjin University made significant progress in developing new technologies for the preparation of a hybrid base membrane that significantly enhances the capture of carbon dioxide in membrane materials.
The results were published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The greenhouse effect is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, and CO2 emissions are responsible for the greenhouse effect.
How to efficiently capture and utilize anthropogenic CO2 emissions is the focus of scientists.
The membrane separation method is an emerging CO2 capture technique that separates CO2 gases with the help of membrane materials, which are energy-efficient and simple to operate.
How to make membrane material "deep breath" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is a bottleneck to capture carbon dioxide using membrane separation.
Tien Jin University scientific team has developed innovative ideas to explore, through repeated experiments, the effects of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance.
The results of the experiment showed that N-methylacne was used as a solvent to produce more even distribution of carbon nanopipes in membrane materials and "breather" to improve the gas separation efficiency and speed of membrane materials.
Mixed substrate membranes prepared with this new technology, CO2 separability is close to the theoretical separation limit of the current membrane material.
" New technologies provide new ideas for membrane separation methods to capture CO2 ... "
Li Yun, member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team at Tianjin University, stated: " We hope that this technology will provide strong support to future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies in dealing with flue gases and will play a major role in areas such as control of greenhouse gas emissions.

Before you volunteer to fill in, you can figure out what a professional grader is.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning News
Before you volunteer, you understand what a professional is.
Each year, a student or a parent fills in a higher examination because of a lack of understanding of the terminology involved in the voluntary submission, thereby affecting the voluntary filing.
This year, Beijing University of Transport, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications, Beijing University of Forestry, Beijing Chemical University, five universities jointly announced a 2020 admission policy to eliminate professional differentials.
What does a poor professional level mean and what is the significance of voluntary filing?
There are three ways the rules of professional assignment.
Experts remind you to read the rules of admission to higher education, including transfer rates, professional assignment rules, etc., in detail before volunteering.
The rules governing the allocation of professions refer to the three ways in which professional admissions are mainly given professional priority, with priority given to scores and a difference in professional grades, following a transfer from higher education to higher education.
Which way the college will use will be specified in the Statute of Admission.
But there are also some higher education institutions where the principle of admission is the overall priority, and there is no difference between the levels of specialization.
That is to say, if the candidates in the range are queued according to the total score, and when the score does not reach the first professional voluntary intake score, the second professional voluntary intake score is reached, so that it is pushed until the last professional volunteer is accepted, and there is no grade difference between professional volunteers.
The so-called "Professional Disparity" is defined by the grade of one or more points published in the by-laws of admissions when the institution arranges for a candidate to be admitted to a different professional voluntary examination, which is a "Professional Disparity".
In other words, the difference between the scores of students' first-degree voluntary and non-first-degree voluntary admissions in institutions, and the difference between the levels of professional volunteers, i.e., 3 points, 2 points, 1 point.
For example.
Assuming that the students' first-rate entrance examination for A higher education, 560 points were taken for professional volunteering: computers, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, professional admission to A higher education with a professional differential of two, one, one, none.
When a professional assignment is made, if the first professional volunteer meets the requirements for professional admission and there is a planned balance of the profession, Ming is admitted to the "computer" profession; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be reduced by two points to determine whether the professional qualification for the first professional voluntary examination "International trade" is met by ranking the first professional voluntary examination "International trade" according to the 558 score; if it is still not met, the third professional voluntary "automated" admission will be reduced by one point (i.e., 557); if it is still not met, the score will be reduced by one point (i.e., 556) for the fourth specialty, and if the subsequent professional profession is still unable to meet his professional offer, no further deductions will be made to this effect.
There are different levels of specialization at different universities.
With the spread of parallel volunteering, many higher education institutions have now abolished their professional grades, but some of them have retained this method this year, which, according to the "re enrolling charters" issued by the respective schools, has resulted in more than 20 universities having established professional grades.
For example, Sichuan University of Agriculture, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Medicine, Jiangsu University of Technology, Jiangxi University of Teacher Training, Chengdu College of Medicine, Northeast University of Electricity, Chiumi University, Nanjing University of Medicine, Nanjing University of Industry, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, Chinese Civil Aviation Flight School, etc.
In these colleges, each university has a different level of specialization.
Some higher education institutions have grades in every specialty, such as Ningxia University, where the files have been placed and accepted according to the order in which the candidates filled in their professional volunteers, in descending order.
And some universities have different professional grades between them.
For example, at the Central University, the total difference in professional voluntary rank is 4 points, i.e. 3 points for first professional voluntary and other professional voluntary grades, no difference between other professional volunteers, considered parallel voluntary, and 1 point between other professional voluntary and transferred professional volunteer grades.
When volunteering, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school, see if there are any professional grades and the form of grade differentials, and, while taking due account of the scores, make a reasonable analysis of the schools and professions to be selected. If the institutions expressly adopt a grade differential for admission in their by-laws, the candidates, when choosing a profession, should be aware of the gradients between the professions and increase the chances of admission.

Death of 3-year-old Belgian girl from New Crown Virus infection - Xinhua Network
According to the Belgian health sector on 24th, a 3-year-old girl who died of a new coronary virus is the youngest in the country to die of a new coronary disease.
According to Belgian health-care spokesman Boudwin Cartley, the girl had already had other serious diseases before she became infected with the new coronary virus; in addition to the girl, a young man aged 18 had recently died of the new coronary virus infection.
Katry said that 85% of the new arrivals in Belgium last week were under the age of 60.
He reminds the younger people not to take care of themselves.
" While it is rare for young people to die of new coronary virus infection, no one is now immune ... "
Last week, new coronal confirmed cases in Belgium increased by 89 per cent over the previous week, with an average of 2.9 deaths per day from new coronary virus infections, up from an average of 1.7 per day in the previous week.
At the height of the epidemic in Europe, the Belgian population had the highest number of new corona virus infections in Europe.
There are more than 11 million people in Belgium.
According to the latest data, a total of 64,847 people in Belgium were infected with the new coronal virus.
Katry warned earlier this week that people had to act before the snowballs got bigger and ended up causing an avalanche.
In an effort to contain the resurgence of the epidemic, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Vermes announced on 23 December that the rules governing the wearing of masks in public places would be tightened and that the programme for the further lifting of restrictive measures in August would be suspended.

The Director of Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Qiu Tenghua, stated on 25 July that all APEC member economies should act in concert to fight the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should refrain from creating unnecessary barriers to trade, in accordance with the rights and obligations established by the World Trade Organization.
Quo Tinghua made this statement at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Video Conference of Trade Ministers to Combat the New Crown Pneumonia Epidemic.
At the meeting, ministers exchanged views on the substantive options that APEC could take to respond to the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic and to promote economic recovery in the region.
Quintenghua states that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic has had an unprecedented and profound impact on society and the economy.
"We are in a double battle, and we must overcome the epidemic before we can save the economy.
If we want to be clear, the virus is our common enemy, and we can only succeed if we cooperate ... "
Quo Tenghua says that the new coronary pneumonia outbreak has led to a series of trade restrictions that have not helped contain the epidemic.
Trade is the key solution to the current problem and should not be seen as the problem.
He condemned all policy measures that were discriminatory and divisive and urged all economies to keep their borders open at this critical time, to maintain the smooth functioning of supply chains and to avoid barriers to trade or irrational trade policies.
