According to British media, the United States Navy Vice-Minister for Operations, Admiral William Moran, continues to expand the Asia-Pacific region - the Pentagon - to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific - as a priority for the Navy, even as the United States Navy is re-emerging its forces to deal with an increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
On September 24, the United States website Jane's Defence Weekly reported that Russia and China were listed as strategic competitors in the new defense strategy announced early in the year.
Since then, the U.S. Navy has resumed its second fleet in order to confront Russia's activities more directly.
According to the report, these moves raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts about the possibility that the United States Navy might be moving away from the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marked Obama's administration.
But Admiral Moran said that the focus of the U.S. Navy remains on the western Pacific Ocean.
At a round-table discussion entitled "Responding to the High Seas Challenge", organized by the National Asian Research Bureau of the United States of America in Washington on 24 January 2018, he said: " For us, no major changes have taken place. "
Moran said: " The focus remains on rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it ... "
But he admits that the United States has a close relationship with Europe.
He said, " We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do ... "
Although Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned that " Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we clash with them, they will be very tough ... "
Admiral Moran said that the United States Navy was dynamically deploying troops into a "new mode of combat" as part of a renewed operation by the United States against Russia, China and other competitors, which would help to surprise the enemy in any particular time and place of deployment of American carrier battle groups or other assets.
He said, " We in the Navy and the Marines support it - the concept of unpredictability of combat, not to appear in the same place again and again, almost as if it were a stroke - this is what we do. "
The first attempt on this new approach was reported to be the Harry Truman carrier battle group, whose early deployment included working visits to the port and patrolling in areas normally only passing through.
Moran said that the United States Navy was currently working to ensure that allies knew that the ships would remain patrolling in traditional areas, and was also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment procedures.
Lieutenant General Michael Nunan, Commander of the Australian Royal Navy, also spoke at the event, saying that the Australian army could work seamlessly with American carriers.
He said that the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy planned to procure an additional nine frigates equipped with operational systems of Zeus Shield.
We've got a lot of airline companies moving up or restoring fuel surcharges starting on October 5th.
Yesterday, Xian Peng Air, Air Okey and others announced that since 5 October 2018 (the date of ticketing), each passenger on a domestic route has received an additional fuel charge of $20 for fuel and a surcharge of $30 for fuel for each passenger on a flight of more than 800 kilometres.
Zhang Peng Aviation, Okey Aviation and others announced that the rate for fuel surcharges for domestic routes up to and including 800 km from point 0 (date of issuance of tickets) on 5 October 2018 would increase from $10 per person to $20 per person for fuel surcharges for domestic routes up to $800 per person to $30 per passenger.
Children, military and police, 10 dollars/person; babies continue to be exempted from collection.
According to the person responsible for the airline ticket, the airline has indicated in its notice that the fuel surcharge is charged on the date of the original ticket, and that the surcharge on fuel is not refunded in lieu of the passenger ticket.
This means that domestic airline tickets issued prior to 5 October are not subject to the new fuel surcharge if they are to be changed to or after 5 October.
Since 5 June 2018, many airlines such as Air National, East, Sea, Shanghai, Spring and Autumn, Shenzhen, West, Okey and others have resumed charging fuel surcharges for domestic flights, which have been cancelled for three years, at a standard rate of $10/person.
This time, Cheung Peng Air, Okai Air has been the first to announce an increase in fuel surcharges, and as of the time of the press release, no news has been received from the country's four major airlines to follow up on the adjustment.
It is also understood that the Civil Aviation Department of Hong Kong provides that airlines may decide to charge fuel surcharges on their own from November onwards.
As early as September 27th, KTA announced that the recovery of fuel surcharges would begin on November 2nd.
According to the Taitai Air website, all tickets issued or reissued by Taitai and Taithai Dragon Airlines on or after 2 November will include fuel surcharges, long-distance travel to and from Hong Kong and the South-West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, African flights, $652 fuel surcharges, and $146 for short-distance flights.
The cost applies to all ticket categories, calculated for each leg, and includes fare quotations from all direct distribution channels in the Kingdom of Thailand.

Ito Commercial Corporation, Japan, recognized the impairment loss of $1.3 billion on Friday's investment in China's Sino-China shares to write down its largest business investment transaction as a result of trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked through the headquarters of the Marion Maskiya Society.
According to Maroon, the US grain sector has suspended its financial transactions in agriculture under the banner of the war on trade.
Former Japanese heavy-duty equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies and others had warned about the effects of trade friction between China and the United States when they published their latest performances, and now these Japanese trading houses have joined the ranks.
The United States and China are charging each other hundreds of billions of dollars of goods, and the President of the United States, Trump, is threatening to extend the tax to more than half a trillion dollars of Chinese merchandise if the dispute is not resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, the finance minister for Ito's commercial business, said that trade disputes could have a greater impact on China's economy next year.
Ito Commercial and Thai Bee Group invested US$ 10 billion in 2015 to gain 20 per cent of their shares.
Hachimura claims that Ito Thong-hyun raised a loss of 143.3 billion yen (1.3 billion yen) for this shareholding, as it is believed that the value of the CIN shares will not rise in the near future.
Ito Commercial maintains a profit forecast of 500 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.
In July, China imposed a 25 per cent import tariff on the soybeans of the United States in order to counter the Washington initiative in trade friction.
"Our grain business has been hit by US-China trade friction. "
He said that Gao-hung had stopped financial transactions in his own account since September.
In his statement on Friday, Gao-hung spokesman Pat Burke stated that the company had done so " in accordance with internal policy restrictions and due to lack of market opportunities ... "
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions would not result in job losses.
Maroon keeps the annual profit estimate of 230 billion yen and is aided by pulp and paper and power generation.
"The trade problems between the United States and China have led to uncertainty."
Mitsubishi Commercial raised the annual profit estimate to a record level on Friday, due to increased coal-charting production and higher prices of large commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Commercial also announced a new business plan seeking to increase profits for the fiscal year ending 31 March 2022 from an estimated 640 billion yen this year to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion).
On November 5th, China Newsnet reported that the U.S. midterm election has entered countdown.
On November 4th, President Trump and his Democrat rivals were active in "throwing" votes to their core constituents.
Both parties have stated that voter turnout will be the key to the election.
According to reports, in the 48 hours before the popular vote in the United States, Trump was busy with the Republican candidate, while former President Barack Obama went to Indiana, where he was on the platform of Joe Donnelly, the Democratic Federal Senate candidate, who was anxious for the election, and called out to the crowd his final claim before the election.
On 4 November, Trump went to Maygan, Georgia, to stand on the site of Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate for governorship, and said, " You have to go to the polling station on Tuesday and you have to vote... "
"The comparison of this election cannot be clearer... "
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has gone far beyond normal.
Successive presidents of the United States face the first mid-term election, and the number of members of Parliament belonging to his party tends to decrease.
According to the new polls published by the Washington Post and BBC News on 4th, while the Democrats' Federal House of Representatives continues to prevail, Republicans can benefit from economic assessments and the strict attention given by Trump to border security.
The polls show that registered voters prefer the Democrats to the Republicans for more candidates in the House of Representatives, which is 50% to 43%, but is still down by 14 percentage points compared to August.
Another poll by the NBC and Wall Street Journal also shows that Democrats are still seven points ahead of Republicans.
According to the news, Obama said to the crowd on the occasion of Senator Donnelly: " When people don ' t tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, it will surely have a bad effect.
Democracy will not work when people have to lie to themselves. "
"The only way to stop these Republicans now is by you and your ballot... "
The Democrats face the most difficult elections in the Senate in decades, and now the Republicans hold half a dozen seats.
But the House of Representatives is more favourable, and the Democrats need 23 more seats to take control of the House of Representatives with 435 seats.
According to a forecasted analyst of FiveThirtyEight.com, Democrats are up to 85% likely to win the House of Representatives.
The NCP convened a seminar on the critical intellectual theory of strengthening and improving the work of the NCPCP, which was attended and addressed by Wangyang.
The National Political Consultative Council held an important intellectual seminar for General Secretary Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the Council in Kyoto from 29 to 30 September.
Wang Yang, Chairman of the National Political Consultative Council, Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, attended and addressed the Conference.
He stressed that the important idea of strengthening and improving the work of the Council was deeply articulated by Secretary-General Xi, whose role was to define the role of the Council, its objectives, its mandate, its mandate, its practical requirements, and its scientific response to a series of orientations, global and strategic issues, which were a powerful intellectual weapon to guide the work of the Council for the New Age.

From 29 to 30 September, the National Political Consultative Council held a seminar in Beijing on the critical intellectual theory of the Secretary-General Xi Jinping in strengthening and improving the work of the Association.
Wang Yang pointed out that, since the 18th Congress of the Party, the General Secretary of Xi has proposed a new set of new ideas for strengthening and improving the work of CPH. For the first time, it was proposed that CPH is an important channel and specialized consultative body for socialist consultation and democracy. It is an important part of the system of governance of the country. It is an important part of the Chinese system of governance. It is the first time that the features and advantages of the new system of political parties have been articulated. It is the first time that the relationship between coherence and diversity has been properly addressed. It has revealed that the true meaning of democracy for the people lies in the negotiation of issues and that the people's minds have been consulted, and has revealed the logical link between `government of China' and the Chinese political system. It has been the culmination of deep-seated theoretical reflections on the development of the CPHP system.
Wangyang stressed that the PCA at all levels would use theoretical learning seminars as an opportunity to further identify weaknesses and shortcomings in PCA ' s work and to build on and improve efforts to achieve breakthroughs.
It is important to strengthen the political party and ensure that its central decision-making deployment is carried out within the context of its work.

On November 5th, the People's Network Beijing, in the current wave of popular entrepreneurship, innovation and innovation, a growing number of technology companies have begun to focus on patent research and development and related protection, digging into the potential value of patents and taking over the market.
Similarly, there are a number of companies that have experienced numerous abuses in patenting technology authorization, use of patented technology, etc.
At the end of 2017, the developers of the APP, Beijing Orange Technology Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Orange Technology), the operator of the APP, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Dripping), and the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the Guangdong Pacific Ocean) sued the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court for patent infringement.
The plaintiffs asked the court to order that the defendants immediately stop manufacturing, selling, promising to sell, using the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, the Chinese Network of Judicatures published the first-instance civil decision against patent rights to inventions, such as Tan Wei, Ho Zhanghong and Beijing Orange Technology Ltd., which discloses some details of the case in which the APP has been sued for patent infringement.
The plaintiffs argued that the patented patented patentee and inventor, and the entire operation of the APP application of the Windward Drive, which was based on mobile terminal-based carpooling services and methods, corresponded to the technical options for patent protection in question, and constituted patent infringement.
However, during the court ruling, Orangetech argued that the Guangdong Pacific Ocean was not an appropriate defendant, that it simply provided a free download of the APP "trip trip" on the Internet, that it did not apply the patent method in question, that there was no direct or indirect tort and that it should not be listed as the defendant in the present case.
Second, the violations in this case are not in Guangdong.
The law provides that the tort of the patent in question shall be the place where the patent method in question is applied in its entirety, and therefore challenges the jurisdiction of the court and requests that the case be referred to the court of the domicile of the defendant, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court ...
The Guangzhou Court of Intellectual Property Rights held that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, had provided an APP product on its web platform for alleged abuses and that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to include the defendant in the Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
And the defendant is domiciled in Guangzhou, within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Orange Tech, claimed to refer the case to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, dismissing the defendant, Orange Tech Ltd. ' s challenge to jurisdiction in the case and bearing the costs of the jurisdiction challenge case.
Other proceedings in the case have not yet been published and journalists will follow up on the patent infringement cases.
Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research: The achievements of science and technology cooperation in Australia have been significant
" China ' s science and technology have developed rapidly over the past few decades, and the two countries can achieve fruitful results in the field of science together ... "
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research, said in a recent interview with China News Agency journalists in Beijing that Australia's collaboration in the field of science and technology from the fight against climate change to the "Observance" project was a dynamic development.
CSIRO, the largest national scientific research agency in Australia, has achieved many innovative and world-renowned research results in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, astronomicals and so on.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"It is a lasting friendship that embraces a tradition of trust and long-term cooperation with partners." Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-metre Sphere Radio Telescope, the Chinese Sky Eye, installed the first international 19-beam L-band receiver.
The world's most advanced 19-beam feed receiver, developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver was based on the years of technological accumulation of CSIRO, which would result in a five- to six-fold increase in the speed of the FAST skyscraper, and would also expand the scientific observation targets.
"It's part of CSIRO's contribution to FAST. "
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO is working closely with Chinese scientific institutions on the construction of a square kilometre array radio telescope, the development of new fuel technologies and the reduction of energy-saving emissions.
" Past scientific research has tended to focus on issues that are hundreds of years later, and now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems before it ... "
Marshall believes that the two countries of Australia are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a range of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather events are frequent around the globe, drought and floods have led to reduced food production and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population booms, ageing, chronic diseases, etc. are a serious challenge.
" The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused primarily on resolving these current difficulties ... "
Marshall explained that CSIRO, together with the National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology in Qingdao, had established the International Center for Marine Research in the Southern Hemisphere, which focused on observing El Niño and La Niña phenomena, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather events and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather, and that new varieties of cereals to overcome extreme weather, developed jointly by CSIRO and the Central College, could also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
" In the current environment, where science, technology and innovation are difficult to accomplish on their own, where the costs are extremely high, and where there are a lot of problems to be addressed, cooperation is particularly important today ... "
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it would be to make breakthroughs, which is also the point of strengthening cooperation between the two sides in the context of the "across the road" .
" to strengthen bilateral cooperation, primarily in the field of science and technology ... "
Marshall, for example, CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, which, because traditional cyanide gold purification is very harmful to the environment, many countries want to find a gold purification method that is less polluting to the environment.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology into China as one of the results of our cooperation in the `across the road' ... "
On 29th, the 2018 Poo-Chicken Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Cooperation Contest was held in Urumqi, Xinjiang, where guests appreciated the achievements of the Poo-Chicken development while also enjoying the local food and experience of the local culture of history.

On Saturday, Foreign Minister Li Yong-ho stated to the United Nations that the continued imposition of sanctions was deepening North Korea ' s mistrust of the United States and that it was unlikely that the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Lee Yong-ho stated at the United Nations General Assembly that the DPRK has taken a " very friendly approach " over the past year, including the cessation of missile and nuclear tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and a commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we haven't seen any corresponding response from the United States," he says.
" If there is no trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation we cannot give up our weapons unilaterally ... "
Although Li Yong-ho repeated North Korea's complaint against the United States' opposition to the "phased" denuclearization, his statement was of great significance, as there was no complete rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as was the case with North Korea.
Lee Yong-ho referred to the joint statement of Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12, when Kim agreed to "denuclearize" the Korean peninsula, while Trump pledged to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States claims that North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The U.S. also refused to relax its demands for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on `denuclearization first ' and on increasing the pressure of sanctions to achieve its purpose by means of high pressure, even refusing to make the declaration of the end of the war, " Lee Yong-ho called.
"The idea that sanctions can make us beg for forgiveness on our knees is that people who don't know us have daydreams.
But the problem is that these ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust ... "
Lee Yong-ho didn't mention the United States President's second plan for the Special Fund, mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim Jong-un and the President of the Republic of Korea over the past five months and stated: " If the other party to the denuclearization is Korea, not Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so deadlocked ... "
China announced a reduction in import duties for 1585 tax purposes, effective 1 November 2018.
Since this year, China has taken successive initiatives to reduce import tariffs.
On 1 May of this year, a total reduction in taxes on medicines was introduced, and duties on imports of all generic drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, and non-cancer-resistant bio-alkali drugs, with actual imports of Chinese medicine, etc., were adjusted to zero for a total of 28 tax purposes.
At the same time, the production of anti-cancer drugs has been reduced considerably, and the import chain value added tax has been reduced.
1 July to reduce taxes on cars and spare parts for 218 tax purposes.
As a result of the tax cuts, the whole-car tariff rate for Chinese cars has fallen below the average for developing countries and is in line with the actual Chinese automobile industry.
This reduction will drive industrial restructuring and optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the gains and losses, help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to contribute to some extent to the price adjustment of automobiles and increase the benefits to consumers.
1 July to reduce daily taxes on consumer goods for 1,449 tax purposes.
The daily consumer tax cuts are closely linked to the people's need for a better life.
The tax reduction was not only large but also strong, with an average of 56 per cent.
Declining taxes on consumer daily goods directly benefit a wide range of consumers and contribute to the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On 1 November, taxes will be imposed on industrial items such as mechanical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials for 1585 tax purposes.
A proper reduction in tariffs on imports of much-needed industrial goods in some parts of the country can attract more foreign investment, help to increase efficient domestic supply and boost industrial upgrading, and help enterprises to allocate resources globally, reduce production costs and reduce domestic environmental stress.
The head of the office of the Customs and Excise Commission of the Chinese State Council explained that the above-mentioned four autonomous tax reductions, as well as the third phase of the reduction, implemented on 1 July this year, in accordance with the outcome of the negotiations on the expansion of the information technology agreement, would reduce China ' s overall tariff level from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than in the EU, is lower than in most developing countries and is at a moderate low level, which is essentially compatible with China ' s developing-country status and development phase.
The Officer-in-Charge described the overall level of tariffs as one of the important indicators of China ' s openness in the area of trade in goods, which should be adapted to the stage of China ' s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China ' s goods trade is global in scale, and the economic base for further liberalization is in place, but the quality and efficiency of trade development is not as good as that of developed economies, and therefore the overall level of tariffs should be reduced as appropriate.
Tariffs are a means of protecting compliance, and tariff levels should be commensurate with industrial competitiveness, encourage good competition, and over-protect against industrial development and quality ...
The adjustment of tariff rates needs to balance production and consumption needs ...
Focusing on lowering commodity tariffs for higher domestic demand, contributing to the transformation of industries, working to increase imports of niche products with a higher concentration of popular demand, increasing the awareness of enterprises and the public, and meeting the upgrading needs of industrial and consumer structures.
Tax cuts need to be balanced between fiscal revenues and the affordability of industrial development.
There is a need to reconcile domestic and foreign markets in the choice of specific tariff-cutting goods and tax-reduction ranges, and to maintain the medium-to-medium growth momentum of China ' s economy, both upstream and downstream, by combining production and consumption.
The Director-General stressed that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the reform and opening up of the country, and that China ' s initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is based on China ' s own major initiatives to achieve high-quality development needs. It is conducive to the integrated use of both international and foreign resources, the promotion of the quality of the domestic supply system and the need to meet the rising consumption needs of the population.
This action and initiative demonstrates China ' s firm commitment to a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, its firm support for economic globalization, its firm commitment to the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system, with WTO at its core, and its continued efforts to draw development momentum from opening up to the world and to better benefit China ' s development.
Serbia has declared a state of maximum alert, and President Sérgio will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
SPK quoted information from the Office of the President of Serbia that, in view of the occupation by the Kosovo Special Forces of access to the Lake of the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station in northern Kosovo, controlled by Belgrade, President Vucić of Serbia ordered the country ' s armed forces to enter maximum operational readiness.
On September 29, the Serbian Minister of Defence, Kung-lin, declared that the Serbian army was in full operational readiness.
Vučić's orders will continue to be monitored by Serbia as long as they remain valid, and the Serbian Army will respond regardless of the direction in which the situation unfolds.
According to Russian Tas, on 29 September, during an interview, Vucić stated that he had briefed the United States and Russia on the current situation and that he would travel to Moscow on 2 October to meet with Russian President Putin to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked whether Serbia needed the same military support as Syria, Vucić answered in the negative: " I do not want a major military conflict on our territory ... "
Vucic also stated that the full operational readiness of the Serb Army was only intended to create a deterrent to prevent the conflict from taking place, but it was also a clear warning that no violence would be tolerated in Kosovo.
The Serbian army's raising its operational readiness is related to two major moves on the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days Albanians have been making widespread arrests in the northern part of Kosovo of ethnic Serbs living there for generations, who have not broken any laws.
Vucić claims that, since the beating and detention of Mark Yuric, head of the office of the Serbian Government in Kosovo and Metohija, on 26 March this year, Kosovo Albanian forces have escalated the situation in the region and carried out inhuman arrests and expulsions of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 persons, including armed police and snipers, of the previously self-proclaimed Special Forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, ROSU, occupied positions near the Water Lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric station, entered the ecological and sports centres near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo and blocked all roads in the vicinity, which were under the control of the Serbian side.
Vucić points out that this military adventure in Kosovo was carried out at the instigation of Western countries and that the actions of the Kosovo Army were not notified to the Serbian side in advance, in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the military-technical agreement between Senko.
Vucić has spoken to NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg to criticize Western countries for their hypocrisy in Kosovo.
The root cause of this conflict remains centuries-old historical grievances between the two communities in Kosovo.
There are separate claims of Serb and Albanian affiliation to Kosovo.
Serbia views Kosovo as the cradle of its nation and culture, because it built its most powerful country here in the 12th century, and the Albanians moved in large numbers only after the Ottoman invasion and the fall of the Serb Army from the north.
The Albanians, for their part, insisted that the original tribe of Ilyria, which lived in Kosovo in the 4th and 5th century B.C., was an ethnic Albanian ancestry and that Kosovo had thus been an ethnic Albanian territory since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have resulted in intense ethnic, religious and cultural conflicts, which have resulted in a violent confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, the Serb weight rose relatively, and in the eyes of Serbs, the practice of "only taking back their own land" was exploited by Albanians as "Greater Serb" and the conflict between the two communities exacerbated.
Kosovo has become a " gunpowder barrel " in the Balkans.
In 1999, armed clashes between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO troops and the outbreak of war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia ...
Since then, despite the news that Serbia will normalize its relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it has not been possible to conclude an agreement that is subject to various forces, such as the United States and the Russian Federation, owing to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
And just a month ago, Vucić made it clear for the first time that he was advocating the separation of Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo and once again openly expressed the conflict between the two communities.
Power communication is still out, and Indonesia's strong earthquake-afflicted tsunami relief is in a lot of trouble.
According to figures published by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early morning of 30, a strong earthquake and tsunami in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi Province, caused 420 deaths on 28 January.
According to Wilem Rampanilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, this figure is only a preliminary count of Palu, capital of Sulawesi, approximately 80 km from the epicentre of the earthquake, where many of the heavily populated buildings, such as hotels, malls, warehouses, etc., have not been searched because of the lack of large search and rescue machinery.
On 29 September 2018, local time, a bridge destroyed by earthquakes and tsunamis collapsed in Bali, Indonesia.
As a result of severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the epicentre of the earthquake in Dingara County and the adjacent Sigil area is still an unconnected island, and it is not possible to count the number of victims.
According to this media report, Vice President Kara of Indonesia claimed that there were thousands of dead.
Power, communications, roads, airport damage... and difficulties in rescue after the earthquake and tsunami.
As a result of power cuts, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu city have to be powered by fuel.
Roads to and from the city have been blocked by landslides and large transport vehicles, including tankers, have been prevented from entering the city, making fuel supplies very tight.
Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs Agus stated that emergency relief supplies such as mattresses, blankets, clothing, food, household kits, etc., had not yet arrived in the affected areas due to road damage from the Ministry ' s tents, mattresses, blankets, food and household kits, in the provinces of South Sulawesi and Colontaro, adjacent to the earthquake zone.
The relief supplies shipped from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area via Air Force aircraft.
In view of the damage caused by the earthquake to the Palu airport tower and runway, all commercial flights have been suspended for the sole purpose of transporting relief supplies and personnel.
In Indonesia’s politics, which commands rescue in the earthquake zone, the Minister for Legal and Security Coordination, Vilanto, has called for the prompt resumption of electricity supply and commercial air services at the airport to ensure that relief agencies, such as hospitals, are operational, that more relief workers and volunteers are able to reach the affected areas.
In a series of strong earthquakes in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, on 28 January, a tsunami was triggered by a Class 7.7 earthquake at 1702 hours local time, which caused a major disaster in the area of Sigi in the city of Palu, Dungara district.
On October 1st, Beijing, Beijing, China News Agency (Journal Yin Li) is a beautiful place, a beautiful place, a beautiful place in the sky... and in recent days, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky model, and has led thousands of people to spend their time on social platforms, and to enjoy their happiness on the screen, saying, "Under the blue sky cloud, the "drinking" skyline, which is the best business card in Beijing."
Since August, Beijing has seen the blueest sky.
Within the city, people can be seen anywhere, with smartphones, or with a single back camera.
On social platforms like Weibo, Wireless Friends, and so on, you can see the ancient palaces, Tiananmen Gate, bird nests, alleys... ..and the buildings display different beauty under the blue sky.
Some netizens say that this is the best urban propaganda in Beijing, and others say that if the blue sky is a permanent screen, all those with cervical vertebrates can be cured, and more like, "It's the blues that make the sky blue for the four seasons of the city."
Why do the people of the capital love the blue sky?
Only because the people who lived in this city in the past suffered from the mist, they sorely yearned for the blue sky, and after the continuous improvement of air quality in Beijing, the mist got smaller and more blue sky, and the sense of happiness that people saw in their eyes was of particular importance.
On the Fourth of July, the weather was fine in Beijing.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations in the city showed a "first-class" green.
On the social platform, the people's spontaneous "Blue Sky" theme photography contest is still going on.
Why is the sky in Beijing so blue lately?
According to the competent officials of the Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, the average concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 ug/m3, in August of this year, the best record for the same period in almost five years.
The real-time PM2.5 concentration in September was more of a frequency-digit.
A major factor in the emergence of "the blue sky" is the overall favourable weather conditions in recent times and, more importantly, the persistence of atmospheric pollution management in Beijing, the vigorous promotion of clean air action plans over the past five years, and the continued release of environmental benefits, which have resulted in the reduction of total regional pollutant emissions, all of which have laid the foundation for sustained improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented in 2013 the " Beijing City Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 " .
According to the plan, the Government has continuously directed the decomposition of non-capital functions and promoted energy clean-up alternatives and pollution reduction, resulting in the elimination of 4923 coal-fired boilers.
As a result, Beijing became the first major gas-free city in China.
Data show that the average annual PM2.5 concentration in Beijing decreased by 35.6 per cent between 2013 and 2017; the number of air quality compliance days increased by 50 days; the number of good first-degree days increased by 25 days; the number of heavy pollution days decreased by 35 days and the incidence of heavy pollution decreased significantly.
While air quality continues to improve, Beijing officially released in September this year, based on a new round of PM2.5-source analyses, the "Three-Year Plan of Action for the Battle of the Blue Sky in Beijing City " , which addresses the current phase of governance and pollution characteristics, the focus on diesel trucks, dust-raising, volatile organic matter management, priority areas of prevention, optimization of transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures and land-use structures, enhancement of regional anti-control controls, investment in fine urban management, overall promotion of green development, and efforts to keep the "Blue Sky" in the city, away from the rarest of objects, to return it to the background of people and not to the main character.
During this year's Golden National Day, the relevant departments, such as the City Tourism Council, business, city management, public security, will intensify their law enforcement checks on the "one-day tour" market, focus on the "six-black" elephants, and, if found guilty, impose severe and severe penalties in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the city government held a meeting on illegal "one day trip" to deploy a special operation to further the illegal "one day trip".
The meeting revealed that the city has launched an illegal "one-day tour" campaign since July 28th.
To date, the campaign has resulted in a total of 39 "one-day trip" complaints, down 63 per cent from the same time; since this year, the city has received 270 "one-day trip" complaints, down 62 per cent from the same time.
Over the past two months, the city has seized 248 Black Cars, 158 tourist traffic violations, 29 shopping shops and shows, 13 Black Clubs, 27 Black Guides, 26,000 illegal advertisements, 31 illegal Days Travel billboards, 3 public transport card plates, 1,789 offences involving all types of travel, 181 cases filed by various functional departments, from a heavy fine of $4.48 million to detain 111 persons involved in travel offences.
After a clean-up, the illegal "one-day-swam" was largely contained, and the "one-day-swam" market order showed a steady and positive trend.
According to reports, in recent years the city has stepped up its efforts to deal with illegal "one day trip".
In 2016 and 2017, the City Tourism Board received 1612 and 897 "one-day trip" complaints, a decrease of 79 per cent and 44 per cent, respectively, but illegal "one-day trip" continued unabated, with frequent rebounds and the formation of black notes, black guides, black companies, black cars, black shops, the interwoven "six-black" disorder.
Specifically, illegal street visitors are "black tickets" , illegal websites that publish false tourist information are "black nets" , travel agencies that engage in illegal "a day tour" or agencies or individuals who do not have the qualifications of a travel agency to operate a day tour , or "black shops" , or "black shops" for guided tours that are hired by the "black club" without a guided tour certificate or in violation of the law, using vehicles that do not have tourist qualifications or that provide passenger services for illegal "a day trip", and eventually they bring tourists into designated tourist shopping shops .
In this special operation, regular inspections and mobile patrols of illegal "one day trip" have been stepped up. In response to the high incidence of illegal "one day trip" and high-impact tourist route points, the authorities have sent daily undercover teams to take undercover visits to the city, where they have found evidence of violations of the law and are subject to strict investigation in accordance with the law.
Among them, Black Cars and Black Shops became the focus of two of the special operations.
It's said that without a black car, illegal "one day trip" is impossible, and black cars are easy to detect, remember and trace, and they are a single, high-value fixed asset.
The authorities use road traffic surveillance cameras to increase surveillance of the priority one-day tour bus, using technical and technical intelligence such as physical protection to detect black cars in a timely manner.
Tour shopping "black shops" have become a major focus because of their small number and their location.
In order to strengthen the deterrent and the strike against illegal "one day trip", the competent authorities are required by law to impose severe penalties in all cases where violations are found to have been committed.
In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on the legal aspects of illegal "one day trip", which examined the means of combining administrative penalties with convictions for criminal offences.
The City Tourism Board has indicated that more regular travel agencies will be encouraged in the future to undertake one-day trips to Beijing and to increase the supply of regular one-day tours to further crowd out illegal "one-day trips", and that specific programmes are still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Board has continued to improve the Mission ' s e-routing information system to ensure that each team is placed under the supervision of the E-routing platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what's been going on in Ugly Town all these years?
As a permanent venue for the World Internet Congress, the U.S. town has received a great deal of attention for its dividends.
In the five years since the first World Internet Congress, the changes in the town have been visible.
In 2014, there were only 12 Internet-related businesses across the town in the digital economy, and by the third quarter of the year, there were over 500 businesses.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in the town.
The Internet conference allowed local firms to accept the digital economy at a distance of zero, the inspiration of the digital wave, the desire to transform and upgrade enterprises, and the investment and research of traditional manufacturing enterprises in machine-to-manufacturing, intelligent management, etc.
The secretary of the U-town Party, Kang-hyun, said that the future of U-town would create a new economic empowerment centre.
The development of the digital economy cannot be sustained without the support of infrastructure.
This year, U-town launched a 5G pilot on the basis of a 4G communications network and free WiFi coverage.
At the same time, as the first county city in the country to have a dedicated access to Internet data, the town of Kiryu has become a hotbed for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Congress, 565 projects in the digital economy have been introduced, with a total planned investment of $37,725 million. The core manufacturing sector of the digital economy achieved a gross product value of $8.73 billion in the first three quarters of the year, an increase of 13 per cent over the same period.
"The town was a tourist symbol, followed by drama and cultural symbols... because of the Internet Congress, it is now a symbol of the Internet and digital economy... "
In the view of the Secretary-General of Kiryucheng City, the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time and, therefore, there is a greater need to build a platform to take on talent, projects, technologies, etc.
Shen Yi has been working outside for 20 years and has come home to start a business in connection with the Internet conference.
On December 2nd of last year, he walked into the fourth Internet Light Fair with a high-capacity digitally protected solution and was favored by a number of clients.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in U-town not only because of her home problems, " In U-town, it's easier to hire people than I thought, and our applications have landed quickly, and we have our applications in the U-town Wisdom Parking Project " .
A U-town Avenue, showing the spillover effect of the Internet convention.
It's not just a tourist attraction, it's an industrial road.
With it in mind, the U.S. Boulevards were created in the Zone of Genesis.
Journalists have learned that in the future U-town Boulevard will be the backbone of the development of Kiryu commune industry, leading the way in the application of intellectual medicine, old age, intelligent politics and so on, bringing together industries and many high-level talent that account for 80 per cent of the city ' s GDP.
At least 410 people have been killed as a result of the tsunami caused by the strong earthquake in Indonesia.
According to the Director of Public Information of the Indonesian Police in Jakarta on the night of 29, the earthquake in Central Sulawesi has now resulted in 410 deaths, of which 97 have been identified.
Another 29 are missing and 540 are wounded.
Palu Airport is still closed.
Active treatment, with 98 per cent survival in 29 weeks or more of premature births in China, has reached the level of developed countries.
The National Children's Medical Centre of China's New Net Sea on September 30th (Jan Jing Yan) and the University Hospital for Paediatrics in Jordan revealed that it introduced Canada's advanced methods into the China-Nicu Hospital Pre- and Pre-natal Quality Improvement Project.
The results of the project show that with active treatment, China has a 98% survival rate of 29 weeks and more of premature births, which has reached developed country levels, but there is still room for improvement in the early birth of very young babies without complications.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese Government has been focusing on the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per 1,000, significantly below the national average, reaching advanced levels in developed countries.
The NCIU Hospital Prenatal Quality Improvement Project for Prenatal Births in China has significantly improved the quality of life of pre-natal babies through four years of sustained effort.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Newborn Severe Care Unit (NICU) at the Paediatric Hospital, University of Jordan, stated to journalists that while increasing the survival rate of premature babies, attention was being paid to reducing the quality of survival of premature babies, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the overall outcome after neurodevelopment, and improving the overall outcome of the illness, which is important for improving the overall quality of survival and population of premature babies, both within and outside the national and international communities, as well as in the neonatal sector, as well as to the key concerns of the project.
In China, the NCIU Hospital Prenatal Quality Improvement Project for Prenatal Births has been working tirelessly for four years to record tens of thousands of premature births up to 33 weeks of age in the country, resulting in a one-third reduction in infant age and premature birth-weight deaths in the country and a significant reduction in the incidence of serious complications of premature births, which has significantly improved the quality of survival of premature births.
The project has introduced the concept of collaborative quality improvement through the establishment of a nationwide network of collaborations for improving the quality of newborns, radiation exposure to 25 collaborative hospitals across China, a set of collaborative improvements in pre-natal care adapted to the national context, improved integrity of neonatal care, systems, and effective methods of collaborative quality improvement.
The Paediatric Hospital, affiliated to the University of Jordan, is working with the National Neonatal Unit to develop guidelines for the treatment and treatment of neonatal infections based on the project ' s accumulated experience, and to provide reference and guidance for the standard treatment of newborn infections in China.
It is understood that under the China Prenatal Quality Improvement Project, paediatric hospitals have introduced the EPIQ methodology into 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces of the country to address the problem of pre-natal infections that plague the care of newborns in China.
After more than 10 years of perfecting, Canada has increased its national survival rate without complications by about one third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world to expect premature births.
The EPIQ methodology has now been applied to all NCUs in Canada and has been adopted in six countries.
The Paediatric Hospital revealed that after two years of EPIQ intervention, premature infections fell by 35 per cent, while antibiotics were used by 20 per cent.
In the future, the University Hospital for Paediatrics will continue to promote and implement this approach throughout the country, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications associated with premature births and improving the quality of care for newborns throughout the country.
At the moment, there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in different regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important building unit of the National Centre for Childhood Medicine, the paediatric hospital will play a leading radiological role. The study will cover the western provinces of Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal care throughout the country.
It is understood that the Paediatric Hospital of the University of Jordan is working with the national Neonatal Unit to develop guidelines for the treatment and treatment of neonatal infections, based on the experience gained through the project, and to provide reference and guidance for the standard treatment of newborn infections in China.
It was revealed that, in 2019, the focal point, located in the China Newborn Collaboration Network, attached to the Paediatric Hospital at the University of Joddan, would join 63 hospitals throughout the country to carry out the next phase of nationwide quality improvement with a view to promoting the development of a uniform level of treatment for newborns in China.
The Director of the Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission (SHPC) expressed the view that Shanghai could be a central city in Asia, not only in terms of research, but also in terms of the construction of the entire service system, the quality of services and their results should have a place in Asia, so as to truly reflect China ' s health care.
"Hero's Monument" — written on the Fifth Martyr's Day.
On 30 September, on the eve of the Republic's 69th birthday, we celebrated the fifth martyr's anniversary, and Xi's Equality Party and national leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend a ceremony to present flowers to the heroes of the people.
At this moment, wherever you are, pay homage to Young-yeon.
The anniversary, it's a fresh start, and it's a wake-up call.
Turning to a thick history, every martyr's name is a living life.
They have hot youth, true love, family ties.
However, because of their belief that "the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe " , they are willing to sacrifice everything to save the next generation from suffering.
"I have to cry for China every day of my life."
Through time and time, the British set up a spiritual sign to guide the way forward.
"Where you come from, where you go " , who you are " who you are " , who you can read, who you can find the answer to.
In memory of Young-yeon, the most important thing is to build a "heroes memorial" in your heart.
According to incomplete statistics, about 20 million martyrs have died since the war of the Revolution as a result of national independence, liberation of the people, and the country's prosperity.
For various reasons, many of the pioneers didn't even leave their names.
Countless indignity fills the ideals with blood, carries out faith with life, remembers their name, and inherits their spirit, that is to protect the roots and souls of the nation.
This "heroes' memorial" cannot be tarnished or vandalized.
For some time now, history's nihilism, entertainment, and so on.
All kinds of historical distortions, denigration, challenges to the conscience of justice, distorts value judgements and provokes public outrage and alarm throughout society.
Greatness cannot be desecrated, and heroes must not forget.
You can't let your actions touch the bottom line be ignored. You must be bold enough to defend your dignity with justice and the rule of law.
On May 1st of this year, the law on the protection of heroic martyrs was officially enforced.
From the standpoint of judicial practice, some cases have been decided with a great deal of interest, both in the effective protection of the shining image of the law and in the release of the heroism and the positive energy of the vanguard.
A people with aspirations can't be without heroes, a country with ideals can't be without pioneers.
Remembering the vanguard and calling for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities in the country, and more than 100 million visits to the Martyrs' Hills every year.
People's hearts are the strongest building blocks.
Let the glory of heroes, the defence of heroes, the learning of heroes, the love of heroes become the wind, the spirit of the nation's blood, and a monument of heroes will stand between the heavens and the earth, deep in the hearts of men.
Reuters Brussels, September 28 - After Italy flouted the demands of the EU and surprised the market with a massive budget deficit plan, the EU took a non-confrontational position against Italy on Friday, but the EU might take a more radical position if Italy maintained its ambitious objectives.
The goal of the suspected Italian European government is to have a budget deficit equal to 2.4% of GDP for the next three years, which suggests that debt reduction is still pending in the face of demand for cuts.
The EU Executive Committee on Economic Affairs said on Friday that " we have no interest in the crisis between the ExCom and Italy " and that " since the EU ' s recommendations and sanctions may have little impact on Italy, he has responded cautiously ...
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy is officially presented to the EU Executive Committee in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level for almost two weeks on Friday, and the Italian bond return reached its highest level for three weeks.
If the deficit targets remain unchanged by the October deadline, the EU ExCom may reject Italy's draft budget, something that the ExCom has never done to any country.
Vice-President of the EU ExCom at a meeting later on Friday in Riga, Latvia, said that Italy ' s current fiscal plan " appeared to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Pact " , referring to the EU ' s financial regulations.
But he didn't say how this would trigger the EU's reaction.
Bidders can submit an application to participate in this public tender by October 26th this year.
The Russian Ministry of Agriculture used China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
The Russian Agricultural Supervisory Authority announced in May that, for the first time in the current agricultural year, Russian food exports to China exceeded 1 million tons, an innovative record.
The Bureau predicts that China may be among the top 10 Russian food importers.
After the first battle over Cuba at 3:0, Chinese women again beat Turkey at 3:0 and won the 2018 World Championships in two rows.
But Chinese women are more difficult than in the First World War.
There were 24 teams in the 2018 Women's World Series, with Chinese women in groups B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
The Turkish and Italian teams are the main rivals of the Chinese team in terms of their world ranking and overall strength in Group B.
When the game started, the Chinese team got in the lead faster, and the lead was maintained throughout, putting pressure on their opponents to take the first round at 25:18.
In the second round, the Turkish team in position was fierce, leading by 6:2 when the Chinese team requested a pause and adjusted its formation to a seven-point score, and then scored a seven-point score after which the Turkish team had scored a seven-point score; the Turkish team at the end of the round would have scored a one-time score of 15:19; the tenacious Turkish team would have scored a two-point score after the 24:20 game; and the Chinese team would have scored the second game with Joo-ting's run-off score at 25:23.
In the third round, the situation was stale, the two sides went up in turn, and at one time they were at 19 even.
At a critical time, the Turkish team made a mistake, with China leading by 21:19, and with Chu Ting ' s heavy-strike and Zhang Chang Ning ' s offensive gaining the match at 24:21; then the Turkish team went after 23:24, after the Chinese team requested a pause, Zhang Zhang Zhang Zing Ning scored the score, and the Chinese team locked the game at 25:23.
Chinese women coach Zhang Ping said the whole game wasn't easy.
"We are better prepared, we are better prepared, we are better equipped, we are more comprehensive in the Turkish team, and we must reduce our mistakes and try to win through our own self-proclaimed scores ... "
In the face of old friends, Joo Ting, who worked for the Bank of Vakivo in Turkey, was very limited in the first game of the day, and then she took the initiative to change, and she continued to take a strong offensive.
" They are familiar with each other, and it is normal for them to be targeted, but the Chinese team is doing a great job of stopping the net and attacking in the face of an unsatisfied tide. "
The Chinese women's platoon will then cease fighting for one day and undergo physical and technical training; on October 2nd, the team's third rival, the Canadian team.
On the 30th of September, China's new water grid, Hebei's high-water zone began to focus on projects in the second half of 2018.
Six projects were concentrated on that day, with a total investment of RMB 4.29 billion.
On that day, the Deputy Mayor of Yang Shikune, the Standing Committee of the Water Supply and Sanitation Commission, announced the start of work.
According to the Director of the Hebei Water High District Management Committee, Yao Hsiu, the six projects concentrated today, with a total investment of $4.29 billion, are industrial projects, ranging from the transformation of traditional industries to the introduction of new industries, covering civil-military integration, cloud factories, food products, medicine, chemical industries, etc., high levels of project technology, high levels of industry, high product value added.
It is believed that the construction and commissioning of this project will give a strong impetus to the early realization of the goal of building hundreds of billions of industrial estates in order to create a new state-wide zone.
The Deputy Mayor of Yang Shikun announced the start of the project.
Yao Hsiu said that the region had successfully launched a series of major events, such as the China Waters International Life Sciences Summit and the Great Health Industry Development Forum, the High-end Equipment Industry Accounting Summit of the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology, and the "Two-Synergy" Innovations Forum, with a strong effort to develop new materials and energy, great health, and high-end equipment manufacturing three strategic new industries.
The Central American stem cell project will be officially operational by the end of the year.

The provinces of Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi and Shaanxi have a higher number of lower-priced areas, including Yunnan, where the number of lower-priced areas is over 100, with an overall decrease of over 30 per cent.
Anhui, Chongqing and others have all been priced down by the government in the 5A area.
The high social interest in the Yunnan Stone Forest, Da Lisi, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guangxi Guilin River, Fujian Wu Zhishan, Hunan Zhang's family, Shaanxi Private Ma Shan, Jiangxi Sanshan and Xinjiang Canas all have reduced prices.
The gradual return of ticket prices in key State-owned areas to reasonable areas has contributed to the acceleration of tourism from the door-to-door economy to the industrial economy, the shift from small-scale tourism to mass tourism, the upgrading of tourist attractions to global tourism, the creation of a virtuous circle of optimized tourism supply structures and steadily expanding demand for tourism consumption, and the promotion of sustainable and healthy tourism development in the tourist landscape and tourism sectors.
At the same time, the National Development and Reform Commission stressed the need to strengthen local regulation of the price order in the landscape, to guide the upgrading of services in the landscape, and to ensure that prices are not reduced.
In addition, the National Development Reform Commission has conducted a special inspection of recent media reports on the small and steady drop in ticket prices in individual areas, calling for serious local responses, timely responses to social concerns, and effective implementation of the reduction.
The work of the Trade and Development Board to optimize in the short, medium and long term is carried out in an orderly manner
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Agency has submitted short- and long-term optimization reports on "significant investment migration" and "technological migration", which are being continuously followed up and followed up on the various aspects of the report.
The Trade and Development Board will make presentations to all sectors of society as soon as possible on relevant optimization efforts.
Of these, five were short-term measures during the year; five were medium-term measures during 2019; and one was long-term measures.
In addition, the Trade and Development Board conducted a comprehensive review of the internal management system, as directed by the Director of the Department of Economic and Financial Affairs, Liangwitt.
Five short-term measures undertaken during the year include:
1. Undertake a review process. Prioritize the examination of cases that are about to expire seven years ago, the cases referred to in the ICAC report, and the new renewal cases. Any case where there are indications of irregularities or violations will be referred to the relevant judicial authorities for follow-up;
2. Field visits to projects involving "significant investment migrants". By late September, more than 20 investment projects had been visited;
3. A comprehensive review of the current system of evaluation. Six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been reformulated in the context of the evaluation of applications for "significant investment migrants". In the context of the evaluation of applications for "technical migrants", the approval mechanism will be improved by identifying elements conducive to the development of the country and the conditions under which priority is given to recruitment. A list of "Ten jobs in the five sectors" has also been established for the annual introduction of priority personnel, with a view to better targeting them in line with the policy direction of the HKSAR Government;
4. Increasing the transparency of information. This includes plans to progressively publish approval guidelines, scoring criteria and weights, and to further refine and make publicly available data for approval, starting in the fourth quarter of this year;
5. With regard to the improvement of the validation mechanism, confirmation has been requested for prior verification of work in Australia; major investments must be checked and financial statements submitted on-site.
The five medium-term measures implemented in 2019 include:
1. Establishment of a regular mechanism for hearing the views of the Talent Development Committee and the Economic Development Committee.
2. Requires applicants to submit annually financial statements made by independent third parties to keep under review the operational status of investment projects;
3. Further standardization and electronicization of case applications and approval processes to reduce human error;
4. A comprehensive review of current staffing levels, in conjunction with the implementation of a number of optimized measures;
5. Intensive revision of the study on the temporary residence regime for investors, managers and specially qualified technicians.
With regard to long-term measures, it is anticipated that in the first half of 2019, the drafting of legislation will be intensified, with a view to completing it as soon as possible, further clarifying the criteria for granting temporary residence permits, review mechanisms and validation mechanisms, and increasing the investigative function of the Trade and Development Board to more precisely approve and supervise applications for temporary residence permits.
The experts of the national non-film cotton field observation and exchange event went into the field to hear a presentation by the representative of the Chinese engineering institute's team of the Sakashi Shura team.
On September 30th, China Xinjiang Xaya (Kingdan Xiao Army) in Xinjiang Shaya County, the membrane cotton grower is popular, "not bad" compared to the membrane cotton next to it, and a white cotton races "open" with branches.
From 27 to 28 September, the national non-film cotton field observation and workshop exchange took place in Xinjiang Saya district.
At the workshop, journalists learned of the initial achievement of the objective of membrane-free cotton cultivation in cotton fields and the reduction of the contamination of the ecological environment and the raw cotton by the membrane-based cotton-based technology system, which is dominated by "magnetic cotton 619" and its associated planting measures, and the significant progress made in the study and demonstration of the integrated membrane cotton technology.
The Chief Scientist of the Cotton System of the State Modern Agricultural Industrial Technology System, a member of the Chinese Engineering College, gave the Secretary of the Zhejiang Agroforestry University Party Zhou Zhong Guomo a presentation on the growth of non-film cotton.
" The integrated technology of membrane cotton, which we have developed, can be fully implemented without membrane cultivation, and can completely address the challenge of film contamination and achieve green cotton planting ... "
In China, the Academy of Engineering has a short introduction to the tree.
Xinjiang is China ' s most important cotton-producing area, with 35 million acres of cotton grown in 2017, or 61 per cent of the country ' s cotton area, according to the National Statistical Office.
Since the introduction of the membrane in China in 1982, the area of the Xinjiang region has covered over 50 million acres of crop cover of all types, with annual use of the membrane amounting to about 300,000 tons.
The cotton membrane cover is 100%, and cotton fields cover about 60% of the use of the membranes in Xinjiang.
The membrane cotton is measured, and the cotton production could have reached 320 kg to 350 kg of acre.
As Xinjiang's membrane input increases, the residual membrane recovery rate is low, the amount of membrane in the soil is increasing and the damage to soil structure caused by the membranes seriously affects sustainable agricultural development.
The membranes not only cause serious soil contamination, but also have a significant impact on the quality of cotton fibres.
At present, more than a third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang cotton was taken in an area of about 14 million acres.
Large amounts of ground income were generated during the cotton harvesting process, the shredded membranes in cotton were difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton and could not be completely removed during the subsequent processing of textiles, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28th, the national non-film cotton field observation and workshop exchange took place in Xinjiang Saya district.
In an effort to combat membrane pollution in cotton fields, to streamline cotton-planting techniques and to improve the efficiency of cotton fields, it is understood that the trees led his team through eight years to implement the "Medium 619" membrane cotton plant and to add wings to the green development of agriculture in Xinjiang.
A quick introduction to the simulator, through innovative breeding of new ideas, to produce pre-maturized, salin-resistant, low-temperature, productive terrestrial cotton new line of 619 "Mmmal cotton."
" `Medium 619' in the southern Xinjiang region has been accompanied by membrane seeding machines, improved depth of seeding, shallow burial of drip pipes under membrane conditions, suitable seed density screening, rational chemical regulation, etc. ... "
At present, a demonstration base for membrane cotton has been established in Aksu, Kulle, Aral, etc., yielding 4,800 kg per hectare.
Illuminated cotton, productive, eco-efficient, environmentally friendly, integrated benefits ...
Zhang Danghai, farmer at the third division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of membrane-free cotton cultivation techniques, the production of membrane seed cotton could well reach 320 to 350 kg of acre production, possibly even higher.
" The diffusion of membrane cotton cultivation technology is promising ... "
According to Zhang Tonghai, current technology for membrane cotton cultivation can completely address the problem of soil remnant pollution, but there is still a gap between the economic benefits of membrane cultivation.
" The support of cotton purchase prices will facilitate future expansion ... "
Symptoms indicate that next, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and extensive extension of membrane cotton to make the membrane cotton industry strong and to address the soil pollution caused by the membrane.

The Superintendence of Markets recently issued a " Circular on Strengthening Market Price Regulation during the National Day of the Mid-Autumn 2018 " , which called for enhanced price regulation in the areas of rental and real estate, strict regulation of rent price collusion, hoarding of rental sources, fabrication of false information to raise rents, mischaracterization of fees in the form of tied services, publication of misleading price information, uncoded price violations, etc.
The circular made it clear that price monitoring and early warning should be strengthened, with close attention to market price developments ...
Locals need to pay close attention to the basic necessities of life, such as food and meat, egg and egg salt, and to changes in the markets and prices of special commodities consumed by the local population during their holidays, and to strengthen price monitoring and analysis of early warning.
Once market volatility has been detected, problems of precipitation have been identified, and timely measures have been taken to address them effectively.
There is a need to strengthen monitoring and inspection of distribution and retailing of essential goods, to increase the frequency of monitoring and regulation of places that are closely related to the daily consumption of the population, such as supermarkets and agricultural markets, and to ensure that operators operate in good faith and in compliance with the law.
The circular states that there is a need to strengthen inspection in priority areas to create a good consumer environment for holidays; to strengthen the regulation of the price of tickets in state-owned view areas; to focus on non-compliance with government price levels or floating ranges in state-owned view areas; to increase unauthorized billing projects; to increase the price of tickets through irregularities, such as the introduction of "garden" tickets; high pricing discounts; tied sales; non-compliance with prescribed codes; non-implementation of preferential measures; price additions; and mandatory surcharges.
The notification requirement is to strengthen the regulation of prices of essential goods, particularly agricultural products.
Due to seasonal variations, natural disasters and outbreaks, prices of essential agricultural products such as vegetables and pork have fluctuated recently in some areas.
Local authorities need to take into account local realities, effectively strengthen market price regulation for agricultural by-products, work with the relevant sectors to stabilize production and market supply, and organize market-focused and random inspections.
Increased frequency of inspections of goods such as pork, which are more restrictive in terms of supply, higher prices, and serious investigations into the accumulation of surprises, price hikes, collusion with price hikes, etc.
The circular states that price regulation in the areas of rental housing and real estate needs to be strengthened.
In mid-Autumn, the National Day coincided with a boom in the sale of housing rentals and goods, with close attention to the price behaviour of real estate enterprises, intermediaries and housing rental-related enterprises, stringently overhauling rental prices, hoarding rental sources, fabricating false information to raise rents, mischaracterizing fees by tying services, publishing misleading price information, undefined price-fixing violations, increasing the level of inspections of price-fixing in hot and selling buildings and real estate intermediaries, detecting non-compliance with the requirements of "one standard" to the detriment of consumers, disrupting market order, cleaning up the housing market environment, and creating an open and transparent housing market price order.
The circular refers to effective regulation of prices in other segments of the tourism industry, efforts to regulate the price order of restaurants, accommodation, shopping, tourism, recreation, parking, etc., guidance to operators in setting price codes, advertising fees, and serious investigation and prosecution of all types of price violations.
The circular stated that it was necessary to strengthen the inspection of transport prices on roads, railways, civil aviation, water transport, etc., and to seriously investigate irregularities such as price increases, non-price charges, and non-compliance with prescribed codes.
Implementation of the "Green Channel" for the transportation of fresh agricultural products and the exemption of minibus tolls for major holidays.
Innovative regulatory instruments and working methods are needed to increase the dissemination of price laws and regulations for offline and offline retailing enterprises and e-commerce platforms, to urge operators to improve their price promotion programmes, to legally detect and punish false prices, misleading price indications, non-compliance with price commitments, etc.

Former foreign aid charges for playing a fake ball, North Control response "No need" - new net.
Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing Holdings Football Club (hereinafter referred to as Northern Control) responded officially to the team's ex-external aid, Anachebe, accusing the team of playing fake football, and the northern side issued a statement stating that there was absolutely no playing false football in the club, which was entirely a fabrication made by Anachebe himself during the arbitration process in order to cover up his blatant violation of the contract and for his own improper economic purposes.
At the same time, the Northern Control stated that it would reserve the right to hold the parties concerned accountable by all means ...
According to the British Daily Post, Nigerian player Anachebe accused FIFA of playing fake football with the Beijing North Control team he had served last year, including Beijing Derby in Round 21 in the 2017 season.
It was a critical phase for Beijingers and sprinters, and the game ended in a zero-to-two match between Beijingers and Anacheby.
There was an official response from the North Control Club yesterday to what the Nigerian player said.
The statement states that, after an internal investigation before the club, there was no false play in the game that the team had taken.
In June 2017, Anachebe joined Beijing North, and in December of the same year, Anachebe refused to return to winter training without justification and refused to do so despite numerous calls from the club.
Currently, the dispute between the parties has been referred to FIFA and arbitration is in progress.
The statement also mentioned that the “false ball charge”, which was of great concern, was a lie fabricated in the course of the arbitration by Anachebe in order to cover up his flagrant violation of the contract agreement and for his own improper economic purposes.
It defamed the club for the sole purpose of obtaining undue economic benefit from Chinese football.
Clubs do not accept any organization or any individual who, for their economic gain, has a personal grudge against the club for unprovoked accusations, slander, slander or slander.
Thus, the Northern side indicated that it would reserve the right to hold the parties concerned accountable by all means ...
The China Bank for Agricultural Development will invest 20 billion yuan to support the purchase of Jilin ' s food.
Since September, crops in all parts of Jilin province have reached their peak harvests.
Journalists have learned from the Jilin provincial branch of the China Bank for Agricultural Development that 20 billion yuan in credit funds are available for agricultural distribution to ensure sufficient funding for the purchase of Jilin ' s grains.
It is understood that the food production situation in Jilin has been generally stable this year, with some food-processing enterprises increasing their capacity to start work and demand for food markets.
In order to ensure the availability of funds for food policy purchases, agricultural distributions have been active through visits to various purchasers, such as farmers, processing enterprises, trading enterprises, etc., and the acquisition of autumn grains and silver exchanges.
At present, $5.2 billion has been invested in agricultural distribution to support the purchase of 1,580 million pounds of autumn grain by various food purchasers.
One hundred and twenty major food purchasers have deployed nearly 300 acquisition sites in Jilin province to ensure that the main food-producing counties are "covered" and that there is no gap in the acquisition of funds.
According to the head of agricultural distribution, in the light of the pace of acquisition and the demand for business money, and in the event of a shortfall in the size of the acquisition funds, the farm issue will request additional credit funds of $20 billion to ensure the timely and full supply of the funds, preserve the stability of the food market and protect the interests of farmers.
Chinese journalists will be taken away by the police in the British Conservative Party year.
According to information from the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, the spokesman for the Embassy in the United Kingdom replied to a question from the press on 1 January about a Chinese journalist who had been taken away by the police during the annual British Conservative Party conference.
He called on the Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party to stop interfering in China ' s internal affairs, to stop interfering in Hong Kong ' s affairs, and requested the organizers of the conference to apologize to Chinese journalists.
Journalists asked: during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party, on 30 September, the party ' s Human Rights Committee held a side event on Hong Kong, inviting the Hong Kong opposition to speak.
A Chinese journalist was taken by the police during the party.
Do you have any comments?
In response, the speaker said that, in the 21 years since Hong Kong's return to Hong Kong, the practice of "one country, two systems" had been a great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements had been universally recognized.
Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong. Hong Kong's business is strictly Chinese domestic affairs.
The Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party has used its annual meetings to organize side events to raise the profile of the anti-China separatist forces, and China expresses its grave concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We are firmly opposed to any organization interfering in Hong Kong's affairs in any way.
Any attempt or action to promote the independence of Hong Kong is futile.
The speaker stated that while the United Kingdom had always promoted freedom of expression, it was totally unacceptable that Chinese journalists were being prevented, even physically, from expressing their views when they asked questions at a side event.
We demand that the Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs, and that the organizers of the conference apologize to Chinese journalists.

Innovative developments driven by Internet technology ultimately create a better future for the peoples of the world, a more equitable, open and inclusive environment for human well-being, economic development and the well-being of society.
In a large Internet country like China, with a large user base, Internet technology has a strong magnification effect in specific applications.
For example, China's BeiDou provides users with high precision, reliable positioning, speed measurement, timing services, and a unique short-copy communication capability; the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, which has a remodelling function for traditional industries, promotes industry progress and plays a positive role in areas such as finance, transport, health and safety; and the help of Earth and Earth communications technology in effectively solving the problem of access to aircraft and high iron and other means of transport and improving users' access experience.
According to the forty-second Statistical Report on the Development of the Internet in China, published by the China Internet Information Centre, China, as the largest Internet market in the world, is promoting progress in social development through digitalization.
And the dividends of Internet technology development are not limited to China, but its results are also a powerful driving force for the development of the Internet worldwide and of the economy and society at large.
For example, China ' s cross-border electricity producers, sharing the economy abroad, are increasingly supporting the growth of the world economy; China ' s cloud computing, big data, Internet networking, mobile Internet, and the development of a new generation of information technologies are accelerating the deepening of the global industrial division and restructuring of the economy and reshaping the global economic competitive landscape.
Sharing the benefits of web-based development, as outlined in the U-town Initiative launched at the Second World Internet Congress, leading to the early formation of a global network market, creating more jobs, will provide strong support for sustained and healthy development of the global economy and will allow more countries and people to take the fast-track of the information age.

"Where can I get a taxi?
We want to go to the Golden Purple Square to watch the national flag-raising ceremony! "
In order to travel from Ningxia to Shenzhen, Mr. and Mrs. Song were interviewed by the Chinese news agency on the morning of October 1st, when they were on the first bus of the Guang Dynasty Highway in Shenzhen.
On the morning of 1 October, in celebration of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a high flag raising ceremony at Kim Purple Square.

Reporters will be in Hong Kong Hall at 7 a.m. on 1 a.m., a lot of tourists from the Mainland took advantage of the National Golden Week and took the high train to swim to Hong Kong.
Mrs. Song, with her slow feet, told the reporters that the national holiday was a long holiday for a year, and that it was her long-time wish to come to Hong Kong to watch the flag rise, and it was a pleasure and a pleasure to make it happen on the national day.
But now Ningxia's flight to Hong Kong is not easy, so it's in the high iron Hong Kong section, and when Mr. Song asks for the train schedule, the first bus arrives at 7.03 a.m., and the city's transport to Golden Purple Square is just in time.
He lamented with the reporters: " The iron is so convenient, fast and on time! "
The 70-hour short-distance train that travels to and from Guangzhou, Shenzhen North and Fukuda and West Kowloon, has greatly facilitated the arrival of residents of Hong Kong Bay.
When Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, arrived, he was about to go to Hong Kong's friends from the top of the Central Ring Mountain.
Mr. Liu said, " We are going to challenge ourselves on holiday in the Mainland and Hong Kong on the Fourth of July, to see if we can finish the 50-km Hong Kong Island route! "
He explained that if it wasn't for high iron, easy to move, enough time, they wouldn't have been able to try the long walk so easily.
Mrs. Yang from Dong-won came to Hong Kong with her 10-year-old son to join the piano competition, and she proudly told reporters that his son had been studying the piano for three years, and it made sense to spend the Fourth of July in this way.
She had come to Hong Kong on a bus, but it was time-consuming, and she was worried about affecting her son ' s condition. She came to Shenzhen this time on high iron to facilitate customs clearance, to halve the amount of time spent, and was impressed by the Hong Kong leg, where she said to the press, " It's like taking the subway, so fast, I didn ' t have time to take a picture! "

Mr. Gao, who visited his family from Changsha Hong Kong on short leave, told the reporters that it had been very happy to have high irons sitting north of Shenzhen, to take the subway to Hong Kong, and to take the bus to Hong Kong, and to sit directly at the Kowloon Center, which is in trouble and time-consuming.
He said, "One double check is more convenient than you can imagine, "In less than 10 minutes, both are passed."
West Kowloon Station, which connects land and air traffic in close proximity to the airport speed line, has also become the preferred destination for many transit passengers.
Ms. Wu from Fujian is going to spend Gold Week with her girlfriends from Hong Kong to the Philippines, and she pushed her luggage out of the West Kowloon gate and said to the press without a scratch: " I was afraid I would not catch up to the plane. I didn ' t think the time would have been enough! "

Both quotas are much higher than the current levels of production in both countries, providing room for growth in both countries' exports.
Reuters Washington/Mexico, 28 September - Mexico Friday stated that, after several days of debate, the Government of United States President Trump and Canada were making concrete efforts to resolve trade policy differences and that it was hoped that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would maintain the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite the lack of detail, the obvious progress described above was sufficient to prompt the Mexican and United States Governments to stop suddenly their plans to publish the texts of the two-party trade agreements and to give Canada more time to accede to them.
In Mexico, Mexican President-designate Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador has stated to journalists that the United States Government has put forward new counter-proposals against the Government of Canada and that he will continue to press for the participation of all three countries in NAFTA.
The Minister of Economy of Mexico, Ildefonso Guajardo, stated that the submission of the text of the United States-Mexican-Mexican trade agreement to Mexican and United States legislation had been delayed because the Governments of Canada and the United States had attempted to reach an "very serious" agreement.
According to Guachaldo, " within the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a tripartite agreement or have to publish the text of the agreement between the two parties ... "
Guachaldo said his U.S. and Canadian officials "specially requested" to delay the release of the text.
The spokesperson for the United States Office of Trade Representatives (USTR) did not comment on the text of the US-Mexican Trade Agreement and the United States-Canada consultation.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comments on counter-recommendations.
According to foreign media reports, two young lions play together in a childcare centre on the outskirts of the South African capital, Pretoria. It's hard to see anything unusual, but they're very rare.
The University of Pretoria declared: " This is the first young lion ever born by artificial insemination - the first pair in the world. "
In-school scientists are working on the reproductive system of the mother African lion.
The director of the Institute of Mammals of the University of Pretoria, Ganswint, said that the two young lions born on August 25 were healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally made this breakthrough.
During a media interview, Ganswint said: " We collect sperm from a healthy lion ... "
Next, when the hormone levels in the mother's body, like the researcher, reach the appropriate level, artificial insemination.
According to Ganswint: " Fortunately, the results were successful... "
He said, "Researchers have tried a few times, but unexpectedly, not too hard."
He said that the above-mentioned breakthroughs could be repeated and that scientists wanted to use the technology to save endangered large cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lions have been extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of surviving wild lions has fallen by 43 per cent in the last 20 years, leaving only 20,000.
African lions are classified by this organization as vulnerable animals.
Ganswint said, " If we don't do something for this animal, they'll face extinction. "
He said that the new technology did not need to feed lions, but simply inject sperm into the gestationary lions, as it had done in North America and Europe for elephants.
South Korea experienced the largest decline in exports in more than two years in September, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer days of work and stated that global demand for South Korea's commodities remained strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea's exports increased every day last month.
In addition, the earlier release of opening data showed that exports had grown in double digits in the first weeks of September before a long vacation.
South Korea experienced the largest decline in exports in September in the same year since July 2016, which was higher than the 5.7 per cent decline estimated by 11 Reuters analysts.
The opening values published on Monday show exports at $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
Although the growing US-China trade dispute could cause other export-dependent neighbouring China to suffer, South Korea’s exports to China grew by 7.8 per cent in September, expanding for the twenty-third consecutive month.
South Korean exports to the United States declined by 11.8 per cent, owing to a decline in oil sales.
Korea's memory chips and petroleum products have grown by 28.3 per cent and 13.5 per cent overseas, respectively, although the market is worried that the so-called "super-cycle" of the chips may have peaked.
" The impact of trade conflicts will, however, be inevitable, as South Korea ' s exports depend to a considerable extent on the United States and Chinese markets ... "
Imports declined by 2.1 per cent to $40.8 billion, or 3.1 per cent as estimated by the Reuters survey.
The trade surplus at the beginning of September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry claims that, thanks to the United States and European Union countries, global manufacturing will remain booming, which is a positive factor for South Korean exports.
The statement states that " higher export prices resulting from higher oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of the year ... "
" But the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, combined with increased market volatility following higher interest rates in the United States, is a negative pressure on exports ... "
Exports increased to an average of $2.6 billion per working day in September and $2.1 billion in August.
Korea's mid-Autumn fall fell on September 24-26, leaving 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korean exports grew 4.7 per cent in January-September compared to the same period last year.
According to the Japanese/Marketit procurement manager index, Korean manufacturing activity rebounded in September, but was supported by domestic orders, as orders from China and Japan declined, threatening to cast a shadow over the prospects of another export.
North Korean media criticized the United States for not relaxing its sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
North Korea's "Work News" published a review article on 30 September criticizing the United States for not relaxing sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea while seeking dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, calling it a "controversial" practice.
According to the article, the United States Secretary of State, Pompeyo, " 4th day, " The key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the implementation of sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea " , stressed that the position of the United States to continue to comply with United Nations sanctions resolutions remains unchanged.
In the joint Singapore-United States statement, the two sides committed themselves to building a new inter-Korean relationship that is commensurate with the aspirations of the two peoples for peace and prosperity.
There is no doubt that the United States is contradictory when it increases the pressure on sanctions and calls for dialogue.
The article says that building trust should be at the forefront, starting with what can be done, in a phased manner, if a new inter-Korean-American relationship is to be established, a permanently consolidated peace regime built on the Korean peninsula and the Korean peninsula completely denuclearized.
The article adds that the United States should understand that sanctions do not work for North Korea.
According to the article, even the North Devansk before the Kazan was a compliment to the Americans.
The "National Interest" magazine quotes the United States Navy as saying, "We're going to meet a strong potential rival.
The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the North Devansk.
He said: " This submarine is impressive ... and looking at the development of the Russian navy, how to use its resources, will know that its main efforts in research and development are, first and foremost, to strengthen the submarine fleet ... "
But the "National Interest" magazine still believes that the United States maintains its advantage over Russia in this field.
Fogo said: " I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages ... "
Previously, there were reports that the Russian Navy will be loading the Kasan submarine in 2019.
The Kazan, the New Siberian, the Krasnoyarsk, the Alhangelsk multi-purpose submarines are all white wax tree-M modified, with a discharge of 13,800 tons, depth down 520 metres, a crew of 64, speed 31 knots, carrying torpedoes, torpedoes and calibers, and the Manau cruise missiles.
On September 29th, the Newkyo Radio and Television Department issued a Circular on the development of radio and television advertising, which has been in operation since the end of the year.
These include advertising for low content, ethos and low tastes, medical feeding programmes on issues that are broadcast without record-keeping.
According to the circular, the focus of this special treatment is on nine areas.
These include: advertisements with low orientation problems; advertisements with low content, tone and low taste; advertisements with excess hours and not broadcast the required issues; advertisements with exaggerated false propaganda that misleads the audience or is published in a programme pattern, such as medicine, medical devices, health-care foods, cosmetics, beauty products, etc.; medical birthing programmes with unrecorded management problems; advertisements with exaggerated false publicity that misleads the audience and attracts the potential return on investment, such as conspirators, investment funds, collections, etc.; advertisements that induce minors to behave badly or create undesirable values that undermine the physical and mental health of minors; advertisements with public service announcements that do not meet the required requirements; advertisements that do not have a sound advertising system, which examines the lack of accountability and accountability; and advertisements with other irregularities.
This overhaul will cover all parts of the country, and the requirements of the overhaul and regulation will be fully implemented at all levels of the broadcast media, frequency of channels, programmes and time periods, " no blind zones, no dead ends, no exceptions " .
The circular requires that all types of illegal advertising detected in the supervision and inspection of the various types of advertising by the radio and television authorities at all levels be dealt with strictly in accordance with the General Directorate's "According Procedure for Radio and Television Broadcasters".
In cases where the violation is serious, cautionary statements are given, criticisms are communicated, advertising is suspended until the frequency channel is suspended, etc. are dealt with seriously, and public exposure is given to society, as appropriate.
In recent years, the General Authority of Radio and Television has repeatedly called for the suspension of illegal advertising.
This year, the National Radio and Television Authority issued a public announcement calling for the suspension of the "0-buffle milk" and "Sava cocktail" and "Bonritt plant protection against hair-sliding" advertising for serious irregularities such as bias and exaggerated propaganda to mislead audiences.
The General Directorate of Radio and Television has issued a number of regulations and circulars regulating the broadcasting of advertisements on radio and television.
"Notice to further strengthen the management of television shopping shorts broadcast on the VVD" stipulates that the VVDs shall not broadcast shorts of television shopping shorts for a period of between 18 and 24 hours a day.
In other times, short television shopping advertisements may not be broadcast by a moderator, or by "selling" of an exaggerated tone, tone, movement, etc., or by "orthopaedic " , "constructive " , "fatage " , propaganda or disguised advertising of breast enrichment, diet products, no more than one (sub) item per hour per day for television shopping, and no more than three minutes for each item.

The circular also stipulates that radio and television broadcasters must strictly examine the qualifications of health information advertisements, such as medications, medical devices, health-care foods, and other legal materials, and that the broadcasting of sex-related advertisements is strictly prohibited.
In order to regulate the form of health information advertising, it is not allowed to be advertised in the form of health information features.
Health information features should focus on scientific knowledge of disease prevention, control and treatment, and should not contain advertising about medicine, medicines, medical devices, health-care foods, and should not be documented in the name of patients and doctors, pharmacists, specialists, etc.
Manturov said: " For the first time, we have adjusted the format of the MAKS International Aerospace Sharon ... We recommend that China be the main guest country ... The Chinese counterpart agreed and accepted our invitation ... "
Recently, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the Fourth Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Putin.
It's his first time at that forum.
Ignoring American threats!
EU or will enter into a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran
The U.S. Government has recently announced that it will resume a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urge other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
But the American allies don't seem to listen.
According to the U.S. New York Times, on 29 September, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed that Tehran was close to an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite the threat that the United States would sanction any country doing business with Iran.
The core purpose of this agreement is to attempt to create a new payment mechanism, i.e., to replace United States dollar transactions by barter or local currency denominated.
The purpose of this approach is to try to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
At the same time, while the European Union is committed to facilitating the agreement, some French and British officials are concerned that, if the agreement were to be achieved, it would be the most open confrontation between the European Union and the United States, which opposes the withdrawal of the United States from the nuclear agreement.
According to the media, during an hour of interviews, Zarif's words sound more optimistic than they have been in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to "strike" America's traditional allies and effectively break the American side's attempts to cut Iran's revenues.
" This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit from it " , Zarif believes that States have the legitimate right to trade with Iran, as agreed in 2015.
The European Union foreign policy chief, Federika Mogherini, also stated earlier that " no sovereign State or organization can accept any other person to decide with whom it can trade ... "
However, she also predicted that, before the United States government went ahead with the next sanctions in November, United States leaders might have adopted a range of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries with commercial contacts in Tehran.
In May this year, the United States Government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed and stated that the agreement could not permanently ban the production of nuclear fuel by Iran.
The American side then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the United States.
This threat led to the evacuation of some companies from Tehran and the collapse of the Iranian currency.
Companies such as Airbus and the French oil giant, Dawdar, have cancelled billions of dollars of investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said that the U.S. government might "take over."
As a result, according to a recent Turkish press report, the United States sanctions do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iran’s oil exports.
Iranian oil minister Zangane recently revealed that no country other than Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that the purpose of a series of actions by the United States is to "mix" Iran's breach of the agreement.
When asked whether the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, " It is a strategy of regime change, which is the real purpose of the United States ... "

In order to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, the Ministry of Finance of China and four other ministries jointly advised that, effective 1 January 2018, profits allocated to foreign investors from enterprises of residents in China were not subject to the income tax policy for direct investment in China, and that foreign investment incentive projects were extended to all projects and areas not prohibited from foreign investment.
Notices posted on the Ministry of Finance website indicate that the withholding of income tax forwards by offshore investors is subject to several conditions, including direct investment by offshore investors on the basis of profit-sharing, including refinancing by offshore investors on the basis of profit-sharing, equity investment behaviour such as new construction, equity acquisition, but not including new, additional, acquisition of shares in listed companies (except for eligible strategic investments).

The notification also states that foreign investors actually recover direct investments that are subject to the withholding of income tax policy treatment through equity transfers, buy-backs, liquidations, etc. and, within seven days of the actual collection of the corresponding amounts, declare the payment of deferred taxes to the tax authorities in accordance with the established procedure.
To encourage foreign investors to continue their investment operations in China, four ministries, namely, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce of China, jointly issued circulars at the end of 2017 that, with effect from 1 January 2017, no advance income tax would be levied on the profits distributed by foreign investors from their resident enterprises in China, directly investing in investment-incentive projects, and where required, a deferred tax policy would be applied.

Journalists have learned from the National Board of Health that the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in our country has decreased compared to decades ago, while the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, experts have pointed out that the most important idea is to maintain healthy weight, to "care for undisease " , to promote scientific fitness, and to provide a proper diet.
According to the Central Information and Interpretation for Adolescent Health Education in China (2018 edition), recently published by the National Board of Health and Health, the key to maintaining healthy weight is a reasonable diet and a scientific movement.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not healthy.
The health risks behind the Fatties cannot be ignored.
The Director of the Nutrition and Health Unit of the China Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, Ting Gang, has indicated that overweight is a threat to normal growth and development of adolescents, has adverse psychological, behavioural, cognitive and intellectual effects, and can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood resin.
At the same time, the vulnerability of adolescents to overweight obesity continues into adulthood, increasing the risk of adolescents becoming adults with chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes.
According to Ting Gang, the 2010-2012 nutritional and health test for the Chinese population showed that the rate of overweight among children aged 6-17 years was 9.6 per cent, and the rate of obesity was 6.4 per cent, adding up to 16 per cent.
At the same time, overweight obesity among children and adolescents is higher among boys than girls, and it is higher in urban than rural areas, with a marked increase in the rate of overweight obesity in recent decades.
How can adolescents cope with overweight obesity?
According to Zhang Zhang, Deputy Director of the Research Centre for Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion of the National Sports Directorate, the main reason for obesity among adolescents is that there is currently too much heat consumption and insufficient physical activity.
In the case of simple obesity, emphasis should be placed on scientific exercise with reasonable dietary control.
Zhang Zhang points out that the most important idea is to maintain healthy weight, the most important of which is to " cure the disease " , which is to provide a comprehensive curriculum for school, parents and students, to spread awareness of the dangers of overweight and obesity and to raise awareness among adolescents.
Adolescents should undergo regular medical examinations to monitor growth and development indicators, such as height and weight, and early detection of scientific findings of overweight and obesity in order to allow timely intervention ...
For adolescents who are already overweight and obese, it is proposed that, in addition to the active scientific organization of meals and sports, adolescents are in a special physiological stage and should refrain from using hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce body weight and must not be blindly administered to diet medications.
On Friday September 28th -- Facebook (FB.O.) said hackers stole digital landing codes, giving them nearly 50 million user accounts with unprecedented coverage and the most serious security breach in their history.
Facebook users over 2.2 billion a month say they have not yet determined whether the attackers have abused any accounts or stolen personal information.
Nor did the company find the location of the hacker, nor was it certain that the hacker was targeting the particular victim.
Preliminary analysis suggests that this was a large-scale attack.
Executive Director Zuckerberg called the incident "severely serious" at a media conference.
A spokesman for the company claimed that his account number and that of CEO Sheryl Sandberg were also affected.
Facebook has dropped 2.6% on Friday, dragging Wall Street's main stock finger.
United States Senators on Friday said that the attack might have raised external calls for data privacy legislation.
This is yet another sad evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users. " In a statement, Democrat Senator Mark Warner said...
Rohit Chopra, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), said on Twitter that I would like to get answers to Reuters's report on this security breach.
On September 30, China's fifth martyr's day.
On such a special day, the families of the anti-war veterans, representatives of the Democratic Party, representatives of the Hunan Veterans House, and others from all walks of life came to the Chinese Mansion, the theme of the fight in Changsha City, to attend the mass burial ceremony of the martyrs in 2018 to commemorate the Day of the War Veterans, and to deliver 10 other war veterans and four war veterans to their mates.
"The anti-war veterans are the witnesses of the Chinese resistance. They are the true, vivid and vivid teaching materials of patriotism... "
Liu Xiao, former Vice-President of the Hunan Province Political Consultative Council, said that the war veterans had been brave enough to forget that my patriotism was a precious spiritual asset for the present nation.
In his message, the Zhu Jianjun Army, Vice-President of the Changsha Municipal Council of the Zhang Sha Municipal Council, stated that in recent years, the "Care for War Veterans" project has become an excellent brand of social services for the citizens of Changsha through living allowances, free old-age pensions, and free burials.
He believes that only by engraving history in his heart can the spirit of resistance be inherited.
At 11 a.m., in the solemn and heavy sound of music, the people who came to the event stood up.
The members of the Chinese troupe were dressed in tuxedos, carrying flowers, and walking at the right pace to send 10 war veterans and four war veterans to their mates.
The participants in the event dedicated flowers to the war veterans, and there were many children in the crowd who, along with their parents, paid homage to the war heroes.
"Tang Man's Mansion Fields Against War" was the first national mausoleum on the theme of fighting, created in 2014 by the NRC and Hunan Tang Man's Mansion Park.
The first stage of the estate, covering more than 2,000 square metres, is made up of parts like "Hero's Indestructible Monument" and "Viction Square" and "The Resistance Heroes' Mansion".
The War Heroes Mansion, which provides a graveyard free of charge to the resistance heroes, is hailed as the last barracks of the war veterans.
Every year, before and after dawn and the National Day, the estate holds a great ceremony and burial.
Since 2015, there have been seven collective burials of war veterans, with 102 war veterans and partners sleeping here.
On October 1st, China News Agency (CHO Xiaoqin Liu) revised the Protocol for the Movement Control of the Three Gorge Dam Water Hub (hereinafter referred to as "the Control Protocol " ), which became operational on October 1st, and two years after the trial launch, the Three Gorge lifter formally moved in unison with the gate.
On the first day of the new regulations, the waters of the Three Gorge Dam are in good order.
The Yangtze Three Gorges Navigation Authority issued its first security clearance plan at 2100 hours on 30 September and conducted security checks on 160 ships, with a total of 124 vessels eligible for clearance.
At 1400 hours on 1 October, the shipping department arranged the first pass plan after the new regulations were implemented.
Following the implementation of the new regulations, the security screening plan was issued once a day at 0900 hours and again at 2100 hours, and the pass-through plan was issued once a day at 1400 hours and 2000 hours, allowing ships to be flexible in arranging for the break-through of the dam.
The Control Protocol added "classified control" principles for the movement of ships across the dam by prioritizing the ships at the dam according to the functional position of the gate and the lifter, and the short-line passenger ship at the gate was adjusted to the same level of priority as the demonstration ship and the good faith ship.
It's two weeks after the launch of the lifter, it's officially coordinated with the gate.
For the first time, the river and the three canyons of the canyons, the new energy-powered ships, have been in priority.
At the same time, the "routing protocol" adjusted the "routing control management waters" from the previous 180 km near dam waters to 541.8 km from the Yunyang Yang River Bridge to the Ishi River Bridge, and divided "the core waters, the near dam waters, the controlled waters, the dispatch waters."
This will facilitate the choice of suitable water for the ship and reduce the backlog of ships waiting in the dam area.
The protocol also provides for the cancellation of the declaration of non-compliance and the 24-hour delay in the passage of the dam, based on the existing ship-dammage, pending characteristics.
With the storage of water in the Three Gorges, the condition of navigation in the storage area has improved, contributing to the rapid development of the Yangtze shipping.
According to the data, the annual cargo traffic through the three canyon gates and the Goku dam has increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons in 2017.
Three canyon lifters have flown 576 ships over the past two years, with 1622,000 passengers and 1,7128,000 tons of cargo.
The Deputy Director General of the Three Gorges Navigation Authority, Chen Dongwon, stated that the "routing protocol" had a positive effect on promoting good-faith gate management, maintaining traffic order at the two dam hubs, decomposing the pressure on ships in the dam area and increasing their ability to operate.
China Weather Net 11 has begun its little vacation, and it is expected that during the day, there will still be winds of around 6-7 in the capital, and it is still in the middle of the Great Wind Blue Alert.

With the approval of Prime Minister Li Keqiang, the State Council issued a " Decision on Further Depressing the Regulation of Licensing of Production of Industrial Products and Simplifying the Approval Process " .
The Decision proposes to further reduce the catalogue of licences for the production of industrial products, to eliminate the licensing of 14 categories of industrial products and to devolve authority for the licensing of the production of 4 categories of industrial products to the provincial people's governments for the technical supervision of quality.
As a result of this reform, the implementation of industrial product production licensing will be reduced from 38 last year to the current 24 categories.
"Decision" is clear, with simplified approval procedures for products in the catalogue.
The first is to change the pre-licensed product inspection by the licensing agency to the submission by the firm, at the time of application, of the product inspection report issued by the qualified inspection agency.
Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, the technical supervision department of the provincial people ' s government for quality (market supervision) applies for a back-up on-site review of the products licensed, and after the enterprise has submitted an application and a product inspection qualified report and made a commitment to ensure the quality of the product, it receives a production licence after formal clearance and is then subject to an on-site review within a specified time frame.
The third is the production of different categories of products in the catalogue of business operations, and the issuance of a licence is reviewed in conjunction with new applications for licences or renewals of licences, in accordance with the "one enterprise, one certificate" principle.
The Decision requires that all relevant departments in the regions move forward firmly with the work on the depressed catalogue and the simplified approval process.
Increasing the level of disclosure and back-up on-site review of enterprises ' commitments, strengthening credit monitoring and restraint instruments, enforcing corporate responsibility for quality, revoking production licences in cases of false commitments and non-compliance with requirements.
In the case of products that are subject to the elimination of industrial product production licences, there is a need to effectively strengthen post-factor regulation, involving public health and safety, environmental protection, etc., which can be converted into compulsory certification, positive lists and publicity to society, uniform certification standards, reasonable reduction and certification of testing projects, and mandatory certification costs are in principle institutionally charged at all levels of the financial system.
Support measures to encourage voluntary certification by enterprises, promote branding and expand markets ...
To improve the quality of industrial products in line with international standards of excellence.
Full use of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality of industrial products ...
In the case of products that retain a licence to produce industrial products, the system of standards should be improved, the industry's regulatory advantages should be exploited, the responsibility for "who approves and who regulates" strengthened, the risks to product quality safety should be assessed on a dynamic basis, the inventory should be reduced, approval authority should be delegated or certification should be transferred.
China's combined PMI ring up in September and the manufacturing PMI ring down.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on the 30th day, in September, China ' s integrated PMI output index was 54.1 per cent, higher than the previous month ' s and annual averages of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that Chinese enterprises ' production activities remained generally stable.
In that month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constituted the composite PMI output index, were 53.0 per cent and 54.9 per cent, respectively, a decrease of one liter.
Of these, the Chinese manufacturing PMI is 50.8%, and the ring is down 0.5 percentage points.
According to Zhao Qinghe, the production of PMI this month has five main characteristics:
One is that the manufacturing base is generally stable.
In 14 of the 21 industries surveyed, PMIs are located in expansionary zones, with the manufacturing of medicines, specialized equipment, electrical machinery, etc. having a higher performance level of 53.5 per cent and a faster rate of growth.
The second is small fluctuations in supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0 per cent and 52.0 per cent, which were 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points lower than last month, respectively, while supply and demand continued to maintain a favourable state, although expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index of 48.0 per cent and the import index of 48.5 per cent were lower than the previous month ' s 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points, respectively, and the rate was lower during the year.
The fourth is the increased cost of purchasing raw materials for enterprises.
The main raw materials purchase price index was 59.8 per cent, an increase of 1.1 percentage points over the previous month, and the output price index was 54.3 per cent, which was the same as the previous month, both higher in the year.
Five is the robust operation of large enterprises and the improvement of small-scale enterprise operations.
Large enterprises with 52.1 per cent PMI, which is the same as last month, have been in expansionary areas of 52.0 per cent and above since this year, and the production index and the new orders index round increase this month, which is the main driving force behind the expansion of manufacturing; medium-sized enterprises with 48.7 per cent PMI, which is below 1.7 per cent last month and is located in the contraction zone; and small-scale enterprises with 50.4 per cent, which is 0.4 per cent higher than last month, rising for two months.
That month, China ' s non-manufacturing business activity index stood at 54.9 per cent, an increase of 0.7 percentage points over last month and a two-month recovery.
According to Zhao Qinghe, the non-manufacturing sector in general continues to enjoy a steady and positive trend.
The index of business activity in industries such as road transport, securities, real estate, etc. continues to be below the threshold and the total volume of business has decreased.
Reuters, 5 November - The President of the Central Bank of Japan, Haruhiko Kuroda, stated on Monday that the Central Bank was aware that the long-term imposition of ultra-lax monetary policy could crush the profitability of financial institutions and could destabilize the country ' s banking system.
But he said that in view of the inflation downturn and the uncertainty in the overseas economies, the JCB needed to maintain its massive stimulus package while paying close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
" The Central Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected by continued monetary easing, and " In his speech to business leaders in Nagoya, Koshiko Kuroda said...
He argued that if financial institutions were to be more proactive in taking on risks to compensate for years of low interest rates, which had led to shrinking profit margins, the banking system could be destabilized in the event of serious negative shocks.
" Although these risks are not significant at this time, the central bank will follow the situation closely and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures, " he said.
The minutes of the Central Bank of Japan meeting, published earlier Monday, show that at the September conference, the Central Bank of Japan Policy Committee discussed the rising costs of long-term easing.
The minutes of the meeting show that one member stated that if the economy continues to expand, " the JCB will have more policy flexibility in the future ... "
The minutes of the meeting showed another member that, given the limitations of the duration of the policy, the Committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan could sustain the stimulus policy.
Kuroda stated that the Central Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks posed by easing policies, taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan ' s economic prospects, which could affect global demand as a result of trade frictions between China and the United States and growing protectionism.
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being. "
"However the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy may be greater, " he added.
" There is a need to sustain strong monetary easing while considering both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner " , said Haruhiko Kuroda.
Despite the rising ills of radical stimulus schemes, such as long-term low interest rates that erode the profits of financial institutions, low inflation forces the Central Bank of Japan to maintain the scheme.
The Central Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war dispute, Haruhiko ruled out the possibility of rising interest rates in the near future.
1 June 2018, corporate logo for the Tesla electric vehicle, Cardiff, United States.
Under a settlement agreement, the United States Tesla Automotive and its Executive Chairman Mask have agreed to pay a $20 million fine each to the Financial Regulatory Authority, and Mask will resign as Chairman of the company, but remain CEO.
The settlement agreement will put an end to the two-month unrest in Tesla.
This bond fraud settlement agreement, disclosed on Saturday by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, would be a relief to investors.
Investors were worried that prolonged legal struggles would only further undermine the still-lost electric car company.
The SEC sued Mask on Thursday for fraud, claiming that his tweets of August 7 were misleading to investors.
According to the tweet, he was considering privatizing Tesla at $420 per share and obtaining financing.
SEC claims that these tweets are virtually unfounded and that the market turmoil they cause is damaging to investors.
According to investors and corporate governance experts, the agreement may strengthen Tesla, who has been badly hit by Mask's recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common's asset management, said that the settlement agreement should have led to more supervision of Musque, without taking the "destructive" measure to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company owns the battery manufacturer Panasonic stock in Tesla.
According to this proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to establish controls on Mask communications.
" It is in the best interest of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, that this matter be resolved expeditiously on the terms agreed upon " .
The charges on Thursday led to the evaporation of the market value of Tesla, which was $45.2 billion on Friday, down from $47.5 billion for General purpose vehicles.
The SEC withdrew the request to remove Mask from the head of the company in a settlement agreement.
A lot of investors claim that the penalty would be catastrophic.
"Tigress Financial Partners' Ivan Feinseth said that Feinseth gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and said that the SEC's punishment was a "light penalty" for Mask.
"His remaining CEO is important to Tesla. "
Neither Mask nor Tesla recognized or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement, nor responded immediately to the request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be ratified by the court.
Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Ping) Beijing Morning Reporter learned from Beijing Construction Industries Group that one of the core building blocks of Beijing Park 2019 - the Beijing World Park Show Square project will for the first time have a multi-colour ETFE puzzle structure, with 5440 square metres of membrane structure showing deep red, dark green, orange, blue, red, green six colours, and a "butter wing" under the lasagna.
According to Liu Changbao, the head of the Beijing Construction Group Project, the construction of the performance square was 4,500 square metres, with a total of 1,182 tons of steel installed, and the steel structure was supported by a 26-square umbrella lined suspension steel slab, presenting a "butter wing" formation under the stretch of the lasso.
"From above the sky, the colorful floors of the plaza are as though they were in flowers, as if the colours were in motion, and the colours were not faded over time and the frost and snow. "
Previously, the single-colour ETFE membrane structure had been used extensively in bird nests, water cubes, etc., but the multi-coloured ETFE membrane structure was the first in the country.
Journalists have learned that since there are very few suppliers of multi-colour structure production around the world, each membrane structure material is very valuable.
Liu Changbao said that in order to avoid overlaps at the end of the noose and "fights", innovatively using the "two-knock" noose structure and ensuring that the noose beams are in the right place through a special fixed plug.
The construction of the 2019 Beijing World Park is under way.
Of which, the International Pavilion has completed all the suspension works for the "Face Umbrella".
The project is scheduled to be ready for exhibition by the end of October.

The Secretary-General of Xi Jinping gave a very important speech at a private business symposium, infusing firm confidence in the private economy’s move to a wider stage.
General Secretary Xi emphasized that "leting entrepreneurs take their heads off and move forward light" was a strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovators.
Market dynamism comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, thousands of entrepreneurs have stories of entrepreneurial innovation, and groups of entrepreneurs have grown and continue to push the Chinese economy forward.
For some time now, some people in society have made some negative statements that doubt the private economy.
Mistakes such as the "private economy out-of-the-box" "New-public-privateism" have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have experienced difficulties and problems in their development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some exporting firms; rapid restructuring of demand has brought with it pressure for transformation and escalation; some policies are uncoordinated, their effects overlap with those of simple working methods, resulting in counterproductive effects of well-intentioned policies, etc.
A combination of factors, difficulties in the private economy, difficulties in the operation of some private enterprises, and a great deal of anxiety on the part of entrepreneurs.
Against this background, it is particularly relevant to correct perceived misperceptions, remove the burden of entrepreneurial thinking, allow businesses to develop with one purpose, and the Government to promote development with one purpose, which is of particular relevance to market confidence and development expectations.
The discussion once again re-emphasized the important assertion that "three are unchanged": "The place and role of the non-publicized economy in the economic and social development of our country has not changed!"
From further promotion of decentralization, establishment of a system of lists of powers to the creation of a rule of law environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a level playing field in the market, and the creation of a society-wide atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs, the Party's central focus on entrepreneurs has been unprecedented in recent years.
The symposium was also a clear policy initiative in support of private enterprise development in six areas, with a series of practical actions dedicated to private enterprise "go easy".
This is a great encouragement to the entrepreneurial community and a great deal more to be expected from all sectors of society.
It's the fog. It's done. It's done.
It is necessary to constantly create a better environment for private economic development, help private enterprises to solve their development difficulties and help upgrade China ' s economy; it is necessary to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel secure in legal operations, feel respect in social life, stimulate innovation and create potential.
The Chinese economy has entered the process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to develop their ambitions and providing greater space and arena for entrepreneurs to develop their creativity.
We have reason to believe that, as reforms deepen and obstacles are overcome, the private economy will usher in better prospects and opportunities for development, leading to a wider arena.
All 46 internal Mongolian import/export certificates are networked for verification - new network
On November 5th, China Newsline and Hutt (journalist Lee Eiping) and Hutt Customs reported that, as of that date, all 46 certificates of local import/export chain control had been networked, with the exception of special circumstances such as confidentiality requirements.
Inner Mongolian enterprises can declare relevant documents to customs by paperless means, avoiding problems such as past on-site movements, paper applications, duplicate submissions, etc.
It is understood that the time of preparation of documents refers to the time required to prepare documents for the import/export chain prior to declaration is a major factor affecting the overall clearance time, and that to compress customs clearance time and reduce customs clearance costs, documents must be reduced ...
The number of regulatory documents previously required for customs clearance at the import and export chain was 86, involving 19 departments.
According to the information received, this time, in accordance with the principle of "can cancel, merge, exit from the port of export verification" and exit from the port of export verification, customs and 16 other licensing agency systems are connected and linked to each other, resulting in multiple running of data and less running of businesses.
Customs claims that, in the past, enterprises had to submit paper applications to and from the field office of the department concerned, and that the process was long and the status of the review could not be tracked in real time.
Business users now have direct access to the Single Window portal for online applications.
Following the approval by the issuing authority, electronic data on certificates are transmitted to customs and automated matching with customs clearance data is achieved at the clearance chain, smart checks are performed, and the results of audits are uniformly fed back to the enterprise through the Single Window, and regulatory document declarations, audits, customs clearances and feedback are processed online.
Han Zhuang chicken soup increased his exports to China by 20 times in four years, or was associated with an increase in youth in air nests - a new net for China.
The Korean chicken soup to China has increased 20 times in four years.
The 5th Korean Federation reported that last year South Korean chicken soup exports to China exceeded $100,000, a sharp increase of about 20 times over the 2013 level four years ago.
The analysis suggests that this increase is related to the increase in youth in air nests in China, which leads to thermal marketing of convenient foods, and to the increased interest of young people in feeding themselves.
This data was published by the Korean Agro-Aquaculture Community (AT) on the 5th day.
Last year, Korean chicken soup exports to China amounted to $103.39 million, weighing 21.859 million kilograms, a sharp increase of 2094 per cent and 3668.8 per cent, respectively, over 2013.
The analysis suggests that the increase in Korean chicken soup sales in China is related to the increase in youth in empty nests leading to thermal marketing of convenient foods and to the increased interest of young people in feeding.
As of this year, one-person households in China have crossed the 200 million mark and are expected to increase to 30 per cent of the population by 2020, and local food companies are also targeting the solo foods.
In addition, the analysis indicates that avian influenza is the biggest impediment to the mainland Chinese market for chicken soup.
aT claims that the avian flu outbreak in Korea between November 2016 and April last year resulted in a sharp decline in exports due to the complete ban on chicken soup exports to China.
In 2016, chicken soup exports to China amounted to $840,000, and last year exports dropped sharply to $100,000 due to avian influenza.

State flag raising ceremony at the border crossing point of the China-China border to celebrate the National Day
" I can ' t imagine such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony on the border, which is more shocking than watching the flag-raising in the interior ... "
In the morning, Mr. Zhang, who had travelled from Sichuan to the Yunnan River crossing point at the border between China and China, together with more than 500 troops, residents and visitors from China and abroad, observed the flag-raising ceremony at the State Gate to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the establishment of the People ' s Republic of China.
The estuary is the largest of the Yunnan section of the border between China and China. It is located in the port district of the Red River State, Yunnan Province, and is located along the same river as Viet Nam's Old Street, which is a country-like port.
As the nation's construction continues to deepen, and as one of the most convenient routes for China to connect to South-East Asia, the port of entry and exit has steadily increased.
At 7.30 a.m. on the morning of the morning, the sun had just come out, and the area at the river crossing had been set up early to gather local people and tourists from the port who had come to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 0745 hours, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the state guard at the riverside border checkpoint were in a state of tremors and escorted the flag to the flag-raising stage at a healthy pace.
Following the commanding officer's command to raise the flag, the flag was waved out with an arc. The bright red flag spreads like the Eagle's wings, and the national anthem's strong melody slowly rises.
" Every New Year ' s Day, Spring Festival, National Day and other significant national flag-raising events, not only show the image of China, but also inspire the love of the nation among the people of the frontier ... "
The ceremonial officers who took part in this flag-raising ceremony said:
According to the information received, the National Front, which is responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the port, is composed of more than 40 troops from various positions at the estuary border checkpoint, from a three-person flag-raising team to a force of more than 60 years of age, with more than 70 missions of foreign servicemen at the national level since its inception.

The Ministry of Finance and the relevant Head of the National Tax Administration of China stated on 30 June that, in order to maintain policy stability, the continuation of preferential arrangements for persons outside China, including Hong Kong and Macao, will be considered in the next steps in the implementation of the new personal income tax law.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that the regulations in force for the implementation of the Personal Income Tax Act provide for special advantages in the area of taxation of persons abroad, and that persons who have no residence in China but live for a period of more than one year and less than five years, who derive their income from outside China, may pay personal income tax only in respect of the portion paid by units or individuals in China.
Part of the payments made abroad are not subject to personal income tax in China.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Tax Administration, the State Commission for Reform and Development of China, and the Ministry of Commerce have also issued circulars expanding the scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax payments from foreign investors for direct investment in the distribution of profits.
The distribution of profits to foreign investors from resident enterprises in China for direct investment in China is suspended from the application of the policy of pre-indicating income tax, and is extended from foreign investment incentives to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas.
During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released on the Korean peninsula.
The President of the Republic of Korea has re-stated the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's "irreversible" decision to abandon nuclear weapons and has stated that President Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The U.S. Department of State subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeio would visit the DPRK in October to facilitate the implementation of the commitments of the US-DPRK leader, Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea has broken the ice to open the path of dialogue, and the leaders of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea and the United States have met, and the general trend towards a de-escalation of the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the problems on the peninsula has been upheld.
First of all, the fact that "the issue of the peninsula is essentially a matter of security" remains unchanged, and that peace on the peninsula is the key to a proper balance between addressing the legitimate security concerns of the parties, rather than focusing on each other's claims.
Secondly, in the dialogue towards the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned remain divided on the steps and modalities for the denuclearization of the peninsula, and due to the long-standing lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the "Who First" game thinking remains strong.
At the Security Council ' s public meeting on the Korean peninsula, held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices around the issue of sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea once again highlighted the fact that these two points on the peninsula " remain unchanged " .
United States Secretary of State Pompeio insists that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean peninsula is completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, for his part, stressed the principle of "action in response", stating: " The weakening trend of sanctions should be the same as the steps taken by North Korea on the path to nuclear disarmament " .
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Council's resolutions in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but that pressure is not an end in itself and that the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political solution are requirements of the Council's resolutions, which must not be sidelined or chosen.
As Wang Yi, Secretary of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, said, in view of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and inter-American relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider launching reversible provisions in due course, thereby encouraging the DPRK and all parties concerned to take further steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process require sufficient political courage on the part of the parties.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community for a political solution to the issue of the peninsula, it is particularly important for the parties concerned to demonstrate political will, to make political decisions, to implement commitments, to resolve difficult issues, to continue to take steps in the opposite direction, to advance the process of the denuclearization of the peninsula in parallel with the establishment of peace mechanisms on the peninsula and to work together to establish a permanent peace on the peninsula.

Reuters Tokyo, October 1 - The JCB's weekly short-sighted survey, released on Monday, shows that the confidence of Japan's large manufacturing community reached its lowest level in more than a year in September because of rising raw materials costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production, which put pressure on businesses.
This survey has hardly shown that escalating global trade frictions have undermined the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-scale trade war has strained business prospects and threatened corporate capital spending.
Active capital spending is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey calls into question the Central Bank of Japan's view that a robust economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to the 2 per cent target, although there are indications that firms are gradually shifting costs to their customers.
" In a climate of concern caused by the global trade war, the confidence of the manufacturing community is stagnating as a result of a slowdown in exports and weak factory production. "
"Trust is still high... and I don't think confidence will continue to decline as the profits of businesses improve and prices rise... "
Short-term surveys show that in September the large manufacturing industry landscape was down from positive 21 three months ago to positive 19, deteriorating for the third consecutive season.
The market's median is positive 22.
In September, the large non-manufacturing climate judgement index dropped from positive 24 to positive 22 in June, for the first time in eight quarters.
The Reuters investigation is positive 22.
The survey showed that the large manufacturing and non-manufacturing weather rating index remained stable in December.
Investors do not care about the decline in the short-term business landscape index, and the daily stock stock index.N225 rises to 27-year highs on Monday, and the continued depreciation of the yen helps improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese enterprises.
Capital spending is robust.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest short view highlights the robustness of corporate capital spending plans, the benefits of upgrading production capacity and the increased investment in robots and automation to cope with labour shortages resulting from population ageing.
The Central Bank's short-term survey shows that large firms plan to increase capital spending by 13.4 per cent in the current fiscal year until March 2019.
The previous short survey was 13.6 %.
According to Nanji, capital spending for all enterprises in the current fiscal year has increased by 8.5 per cent, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble economy.
According to him, " given that small enterprises are increasing their profit projections from now on, there is room for further growth in capital spending, but this is largely dependent on the impact of trade wars on business confidence ... "
Short-term surveys of the increased ability of enterprises to transfer costs, with a positive 7 per cent output price index for large enterprises, are encouraging signs of progress in Japan ' s efforts to counter deflation.
The index for measuring employment in large enterprises reached negative 23, the highest level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Thanks to strong corporate spending, the second season of Japan's economy has rebounded since the contraction of January-March this year.
But summer trade frictions have escalated and the supply chain has been disrupted by natural disasters that have overshadowed the prospects of Japan’s export-dependent economy.
In United States dollars, the rate of increase in the import and export of services is 16.4 per cent.
Department of Commerce website press release quoted the Director of the Division as saying that total imports and exports of emerging services exceeded $1 trillion in January-August, increasing faster than the total.
Of this total, new services exports and imports increased by 20.9 per cent to 1,138.39 billion yuan, which is 10.4 percentage points higher than the overall rate of growth of services imports and exports, and boosting the share of emerging services by nearly 3 percentage points.
In terms of services exports, between January and August, services exports continued the rapid growth momentum since the beginning of the year, with exports growing at a faster rate than imports by 5.7 percentage points.
Among them, the three highest growth areas are telecommunications computers and information services, personal culture and recreation services, and insurance services, at a rate of 61.1 per cent, 38.8 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.
The Officer-in-Charge of the Division also noted that the share of new and emerging service imports had increased in January-August.
In January-August, imports of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6 per cent of service imports, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Of these, the import of financial services, intellectual property user fees, telecommunications computers and information services increased at an average rate of over 20 per cent, with 47.1 per cent, 23.3 per cent and 23.2 per cent, respectively.

The price of oil or the "three-time rise" could be filled with oil by the Fourth of July.
On September 30th, September 30th, Beijing, at 2400 hours, the new recharging window will be opened in parallel with the Fourth of July.
Many agencies forecast a substantial increase in oil prices, with a "triple rise."
The owners of the cars that are planning to travel can fill the cars with gas before the price rises.
According to information from the public, the corresponding increase in oil products in the country is expected to be around $190 per ton; the increase in information from Zhubok is estimated at $220 per ton.
In September, oil prices had risen twice: on 3 September, petrol had been raised by 180 yuan/tonne and diesel by 170 yuan/t; on 17 September, petrol had been increased by 145 yuan/tonne and diesel by 145 yuan/tonne.
Domestic oil prices have been linked to international oil prices, and since the current round of price calculations, international oil prices have risen, and Brent crude oil has gone through the 80-dollar threshold, continuing to explore.
As at 28 September, the U.S. WTI crude oil futures had increased by $1.13 to $73.25 per barrel.
Brent's crude oil futures increased by $1.00 to $82.72 per barrel.
" In the light of the international situation, tensions such as the United States sanctions against Iran have increased and oil prices have generally moved more strongly, followed by a clear refusal by the OPEC Derogation Conference to increase production, confidence in the market and steady upward movement of oil prices ... "
Drazen's I.D.A.A. just said that.
For retail purposes, the price of petrol at the current Beijing Central Oil Stations, 92 and 95, respectively, is 7.66 and 8.15.
According to Yang Li, a public information analyst, there has been no significant change in the promotion strategy for retailing gas stations, with the current preference margin of 0.5-0.7 yuan/litre for major stations such as petrochemicals, and 0.5-1.2 yuan/litre for private stations.
"The current round of retail prices is about to increase `triple-time ' , which is about to increase by 0.14-0.16 dollars, and suggests that private car owners travel with oil before the Fourth of July. "

Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany - China New Network
The 69th International Astronautical Congress opened on October 1st at the Bremen Exhibition Centre of Xinhua News Agency, Bremen, Germany, on October 1st, and was attended by more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and businesses, expert scholars and young students from all over the world.
In his opening remarks, the President of IAF, Jean-Yves Leggar, said that the global space industry was no longer a small number of countries and institutions, and that the number of participants had increased significantly this year over the previous session, indicating that more and more agencies and people were joining it.
He called for greater cooperation and innovation among nations to advance the space industry.
China ' s Vice-Minister of Industry and Information Technology, Director-General of the National Space Agency, Zhang Kwai, presented China ' s space programme and stated that China would expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to the cause of space for mankind.
The participation of relevant institutions such as China Aerospace Science and Technology Group, China Space Science and Technology Group, and representatives of a number of private enterprises demonstrated the latest achievements in Chinese space, including various types of launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress, which has been held annually since 1950, is the largest gathering of the world's aviation community.
The Congress was held for five days and was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Centre for Applied Science and Technology and Microgravity Studies of Bremen University, the International Institute of Space Law and others.
Reuters Beijing, 5 November - China Foreign Trade Centre, a Sunday press release, stated that the meeting revealed that China ' s foreign trade situation remained complex and critical, with 80.6 per cent of enterprises predicting better exports than in the previous year or evenly throughout 2018.
However, considering domestic raw materials, the increasing cost of a combination of factors such as labour, and the increased external environment of trade friction between China and the United States, the participating enterprises consider the export situation to be less than optimistic next year.
At the closing press conference of the 124th session of the Guangcheng Conference, the Under-Secretary-General, Press Speaker and Deputy Director of the China Foreign Trade Centre Xu Jun said that the number of overseas buyers and exports at the current meeting had been reduced by the same amount.
189,812 people from 215 countries and territories attended the meeting, a decrease of 1.11 per cent over the same period.
Exports have been made in the amount of RMB 206,494 million ($29,860 million), a decrease of 1 per cent over the same period.
From the market point of view, for Japan, the 10 ASEAN countries, the " BRICS " , the South Korea deal grew by 74.4 per cent, 11.4 per cent, 7.2 per cent, 2.5 per cent, and the traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union fell by 30.3 per cent, 8.9 per cent, 7.3 per cent, 0.8 per cent, respectively.
In industry, transport, mechanical equipment, construction and decoration materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, bathing equipment grew by 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent and 7.6 per cent, respectively, while textiles and clothing, domestic appliances, decreased by 13.0 per cent and 6.7 per cent.
As a barometer and windbeam for China ' s foreign trade, Xu said that the data on the participation of the current meeting of the purchasers and the export transactions show that China ' s foreign trade development will continue to face a number of uncertainties and uncertainties next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reforms and the recent introduction of national and local policy measures, such as the "Six Stable" policy, China's new dynamism in foreign trade is accelerating and new progress has been made in the diversification of the enterprise market, which are important foundations and strong conditions for foreign trade development.
" Combined, China ' s foreign trade imports and exports are expected to grow steadily throughout the year, with further improvements in quality and efficiency ... "
The Chinese Customs Administration announced that exports in September had increased by 14.5 per cent in dollar terms, imports by 14.3 per cent in year-on-year, trade surpluses in September were $31.69 billion, and export growth and trade surpluses in September were the highest since February.
Despite the escalation of trade friction between China and the United States, China's export performance in September was significantly higher than expected, with strong external demand, and the ability of enterprises to hedge their exports with the devaluation of the renminbi or the main supporting factors prior to the imposition of tariffs in the United States showed to some extent the resilience of China's foreign trade, but the impact of the Chinese-American trade war on confidence and on the industrial chain could not be minimized, and analysts believe that the challenges of China's foreign trade could be felt in the fourth quarter or next year.
The Reuters survey revealed that the United States fund manager had recommended an increase in cash holdings in September, maintaining a cautious stance, as the United States and China began the latest round of reciprocal import tariffs, and the dispute showed no signs of abating.
However, according to the 12 fund managers participating in the survey, North America ' s asset allocation has increased to its highest level since June 2017, while the United Kingdom, the euro area, and especially emerging markets, have fallen.
The global equity ratio averaged 56.6 per cent, and the bond ratio 35.5 per cent, largely in line with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio rose to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager from a large fund company said, " Some economic data bring confidence to the market, but the war on trade remains the greatest concern, so it is best to be prepared to enter when markets fall ... "
But the fund manager still preferred equities in September, especially US equities, even though US equities were considered to be overpriced.
Today, China's opening for Shanghai and the world's first major national-level exhibition on the subject of imports - the China International Import Fair - officially opened the curtain in the expectation of the world.
An exhibition is like a window that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through this "window" of the Expo, people see a move towards a higher level of "open China"; and through this "window" of the Fair, the world is welcome to win with the "reform, open and then" China.
" For a country, openness is like a cocoon, which will experience pain for a while, but will be replaced by a new life ... "
Mr. Xi summed up the opening of the road and said, "Why can China do it?"
Recalling that 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which has dared to enter the world market, has faced vortex and wind, has always faced all risk challenges in an open-minded manner, unleashing internal dynamics and increasing competitiveness.
It can be said that China has strongly interpreted the value and significance of openness with its own achievements.
At the beginning of a new history, an import-oriented fair was a major decision taken by the center of the party, with Comrade Xi at its core, to promote a new high level of openness to the outside world. It was a major initiative by China to open its markets to the world. It was China's practical action in support of economic globalization and trade liberalization. It demonstrated the strong and clear will of China to open its doors, not to close but to expand.
And the large number of candidates from all countries, "a hard one" for the exhibit, is the greatest recognition and the best response to China ' s broader and broader development of an open economy at a deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
The construction of a wall of trade protectionism by some countries and a return to the old path of unilateralism have increased the international community ' s concerns about the prospects for free trade and added much uncertainty to the warming world economy.
Against this backdrop, this event on the side of Huangpo is an expression of China ' s defence of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets, share the confidence of China in the future, and China in the future.
Go alone, people, go far.
China ' s open mind and embrace of the world has not only made a powerful contribution to its own development, but has also given the world and the region the opportunity of China.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the building of a "cross the road " , initiated the creation of an Asian Investment Bank and set up a Silk Road Fund China has provided a series of international public goods that offer real export markets, opportunities for development and jobs, and enabled enterprises from all countries to take China ' s fast-track ride.
It's a public good, a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their distinctive and high-quality products and services.
In addition to national firms, domestic consumers are the real beneficiaries.
By setting up this platform of "opportunity and excellence", it provides a multi-channel supply of good quality for the upgrading of consumption, satisfying the people's personalization, diversity and differentiation of consumption needs.
As China opens its doors, the goods flow, and the goods use them, the steps towards a better life will be firmer.
From a more macro point of view, the significance of the Expo goes beyond economics and trade to a vision of the future that conveys the concepts of openness, inclusion, inclusiveness, balance, win-winness and forges a common understanding of the challenges of today.
The world is better, China is better; China is better, the world is better.
We look forward to the fair bringing to the world greatness and success; we look forward to a brighter future of open China and the world working together to build a community of human destiny at a higher level.
Foreign media: A framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States and the United States of America.
The [summary] agreement includes the opening by Canada of its dairy market to the United States and the temporary withholding by the United States of customs duties on Canadian-produced cars.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of 30 September local time that the United States and Canada had entered into a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was revealed that the agreement included the opening of Canada's dairy market to the United States and the temporary withholding of United States tariffs on Canadian-produced cars.
Last month, the United States and Mexico announced an initial agreement in principle to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the 31 August deadline set by the United States to extend the negotiations until 30 September.
Previously, the spokesperson for Canada ' s Foreign Minister, Friland, stated that Canada would only sign a favourable agreement, " focusing on substance, not on a timetable ... We will continue our consultations in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in Canada ' s national interest ... "
More than 90% of Brazilian female voters claim that the presidential candidate did not take into account the needs of women.
According to the South American diaspora network, data released recently by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) show that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not believe that presidential candidates take women's needs into account.
According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has now reached 107 million, and if women from all over Brazil are brought together to form a country, the country ' s population will be 13th in the world, twice as many as the population of Spain.
In Brazil, women accounted for 52 per cent of the electorate and men for 48 per cent of the electorate. Although the proportion of women in the electorate was very high, the proportion of women in the Brazilian Congress was only 10 per cent.
In 193 countries around the world, women's political participation in Brazil ranks only 154th, higher than in the Arab States.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have not succeeded in obtaining their rights.
According to the Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, this phenomenon exists as a result of the confluence of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
" Politics should be the claim of citizens to citizenship, identity, access to public goods and the formation of a single society by multiple social groups ... But politics in Brazil belongs to the monopoly of one group, and the majority of the population is not represented ... "
An earlier study conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Motorcycles (Loucomotiva) also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that the elected politicians were able to represent their rights, 90 per cent of Brazilian women did not agree with the decisions taken by politicians, and 93 per cent did not agree with the governance policies of the current Government.
"We need to reverse the under-representation of women in Parliament, and Brazil ' s political system continues to be affected by inequality ... So far, there are serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazil ' s political sphere. "
The majority of Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy, despite the lack of women's rights.
The survey showed that 76% of women thought they could make a difference in democratic elections, and 72% were interested in politics.
Moreover, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women less prejudiced.
On October 1st, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the birth of the 69-year-old New China.
More than 80 representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, the Chinese Press Agency, financial institutions, Chinese enterprises, the Chinese diaspora, the Confucius Academy and students in study attended the event.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the birth of a 69-year-old in New China.
After the flag-raising ceremony, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Xuan said that, on the 69th birthday of the great motherland, we held a flag-raising ceremony in other countries, which was a profoundly patriotic educational event.
We've been abroad for a long time, but we've always been in the great country.
Zhang Xuan said that the Chinese nation today is closer than ever to the great goal of national renewal and to the centre of the world stage.
" Our mission, responsibilities and work are more glorious, arduous and onerous than ever before... "

The T2 terminal at Guilin International Airport in Guangxi was inaugurated on the 30th day.
According to CCP Guilin City Secretary Zhao Lu Qin, the new terminal was able to meet the demand of 12 million passengers per year, building a new advantage in air traffic in Guilin, which is of great importance for the further improvement of the Guangxi River connection, sea and iron connections, land and sea, and the air terminal connection to the "Four Ones" modern 3D traffic pattern.
This year, it's estimated that there will be more than 90 million visitors to Guilin.
The expansion of the T2 terminal and site support facilities at Guilin International Airport is a major public good for the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Autonomous Region and a landmark project for the construction of the Guilin International Tour resort.
The project began in December 2015, with 100,000 square metres of construction, with a total investment of RMB 3,258 million, which, when completed, will cover 12 million annual passenger throughputs, 10.12 million trips and 95,000 tons of mail throughputs.
On the same day, over 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal at Guilin International Airport.
The design of the new terminal is inspired by the fact that it is a mountain crown, near the landscape of the Dragon Ridge Terrace and the nests of the people living in the north of Guilin Mountain.
It was described that the new terminal at Guilin Airport could meet the peak traffic of nearly 4,000 people per hour, using smart baggage sorting systems, security integration platforms, smart airports such as face recognition, and planning commercial areas covering catering, department goods, tax exemptions and recreation.
With most of the growth in Asia and emerging markets not encouraging as a result of Europe, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container ship docked in a port in New Jersey, United States.
But since the current growth in the United States has benefited from tax cuts and fiscal stimulus, the economy has also received close attention from the outside world.
" As the United States returns to full employment, the economic downturn is inevitable ... "
He said the only question was when it would happen, and in his opinion it would only be ahead of schedule.
Although Barclay is optimistic about the economic prospects of the United States by the end of this year, the Bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to predict more distant times.
" In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth, current fiscal policy-enabled growth will not be sustainable " , Barclay Economist said in a study ...
" At a time of lack of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing of the economy in 2020 will rise " , they say.
A series of business surveys will provide an overview of the economic cycle in major economies at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and U.S. manufacturing surveys, due to be published next Monday, will receive attention, and services surveys will be published on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data will certainly be on non-farm employment in the United States, which will be released next Friday, and which will provide a clue as to whether the tight employment market is driving a significant increase in wages.
Not only is it important for the profitability of enterprises and the purchasing power of consumers, but it may also be a source of concern for officials of the United States Federal Reserve/FED.
"Payments will be of great concern, as there may be another significant increase over the previous month.
September may not be 3% higher than the same period in the previous year, but we can well expect a breakthrough next month, " The Dutch International Group (ING) economist wrote in a study.
While China and the rest of Asia are taking vacations, the region’s data will be diluted next week, Europe’s political situation may become a source of market volatility.
The Italian Government ignores previous financial commitments to the EU, and the other EU member States will have to decide quickly whether or not to strongly oppose Italy's decision. Tria does not support the decision, and he wishes to abide by EU rules.
As the British exit talks enter a critical phase, the annual conference of the British Conservative Party in Birmingham will probably be full of fire.
At the same time, with the expected presidential elections in Brazil next weekend, concerns about emerging markets are unlikely to diminish.
[Summary] When completed, the ship will be delivered to the East Sea Subdirectorate of China ' s State Oceanic Administration, and Chen Xue, Director of the Observation Service of the Ocean Early Warning Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, stated that the launch of the vessel would be of great importance for the development of China ' s offshore ocean observing system and the advancement of global ocean observations.
On September 29th, China's first 3,000-ton large buoy ship, the Yinghong 22, went into the China Wreck Group.
Once completed, the ship will break the current Chinese equipment bottlenecks in large buoys, sub-platforms, recycling, recovery and repair.
The Sun-Red 22 wheel is used primarily for regular cruise maintenance of buoys/sub-pots, regular emplacement, recycling, buoys/sub-pots emergency sheeting, recycling, recovery, recovery and repair, and has the capacity to carry out integrated marine survey missions such as fault surveys.
The new captain is 89 meters wide and 7.2 meters deep, with a continuation of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Wei-ju, Deputy Managing Director of the WVG, stated: " The fact that the 22 ships are the first of its kind to be operated by a large buoy and the only one in the country with the capacity to operate a large buoy of 10 metres will further enhance our capacity to secure a large buoy ... "
It is understood that the ship, once completed, will be used by the East Sea Subdirectorate of the National Ocean Administration of China, and Chen Zhui, Head of the Observation Service of the Ocean Early Warning Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, stated that the launch of the ship would be of great importance for the development of China ' s offshore ocean observing system and the advancement of global ocean observations.
" This ship, which has both large buoy-laying maintenance operations and an integrated marine investigation capability, is the first comprehensive vessel in our country dedicated to mid-altitude buoy operations and integrated marine investigations ...
With such buoy operating vessels, our ocean observations and ocean surveys will now have a powerful instrument ... "
On October 1st, Chinanet Qingdao electricity was affected by Typhoon "Sun Mei", and the first day of the race was postponed until October 1 in the series "Masai Yunteng Cup" of the 2018 International Extreme Boats, scheduled to open on September 30, and a meeting was held prior to the match at the Qingdao Centre. The captains of the 12 water-wing dhow fleet from six countries and territories were brought to light.
As a result of Typhoon "Dummy", strong winds continued in Hong Kong, with a maximum wind speed of up to 24 knots, the launch signal was delayed by almost 90 minutes from 1 p.m. and the speed of the wind remained constant, and the referee-in-chief, Anne Mdrant, announced the cancellation of the first day's competition, postponing it until the afternoon of 1 October.
"The strong winds from the shore continue, and the sea conditions are so intense... "
Mdrand explained: " In this case, no one knows when the wind will strike at the boat.
Close to the city, cancellation is the wisest option in the current state of affairs... "
There's still a bit of disappointment for all the crews that are ready.
"The boat is ready to stop, and we're in good shape."
Aoshima's rudder, Max Richardson, said: " But I know that a reschedule is the right choice, and we hope that today's wind is smaller and that we can do it once and for all. "
Omica Wilkinson, who was dubbed the New Zealand Star of Hope at the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020, said: "The loss of one day makes the game more interesting.
Because today's game is going to increase, and there's only two days left.
I'm sure you're all going to have a lot of work to do."
Despite the sea winds, the French ABM rudder Pierre Ives Durand, meeting before the race, appealed about his warmth with Qingdao: 5 years ago, the international limit sail series had its own injuries, broken muscles, and it was thanks to the handling of the local medical team that he was able to stand at the game today five years later.
It has been learned that the International Ultimate Boat Series was launched in 2007 as part of a well-known world sail competition with Volvo, the American Cup, the World Boats Against Tours, etc.
Qingdao Station is going to use FlyingPhantom.
It's the eighth year since the year 2018 when the race landed on Aoshima, the capital of the sailboat, and Aoshima Station was also the winner of the series.
Despite the global financial market shock, the Hong Kong Financial Authority reported on Monday that the foreign exchange fund's investment revenue in the third quarter of this year was reduced by 97 per cent annually, but was better than it was in the previous quarter. Foreign exchange losses were also significantly narrowed as a result of the high levels of overseas stocks during the Chinese-American trade war.
According to the latest data of the Authority, in July-September 2018 the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment revenue of HK$ 1.6 billion, significantly lower than the HK$ 61.8 billion recorded in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$ 100 million for the second quarter of this year.
Managing Director Chen Deok-hyun stated in the Legislative Council that the Hong Kong and emerging market equity indices ran counter to the United States equity indices at the beginning of the trade war, until late September, when the United States stock market index peaked in early October, when market sentiment began to reverse, as investors became aware that the trade war would be detrimental to the United States itself.
" A change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if the war on trade has only one-sided influence, it will not be very helpful in solving the matter ... "
At the same time, however, he pointed out that " financial market volatility will continue to rise if the trade war between China and the United States is not resolved ... "
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund ' s equity investment deficit in Hong Kong was between HK$ 8 and 4.7 billion lower than in the previous quarter, while the foreign exchange deficit was between HK$ 172 and HK$ 12.8 billion; the foreign exchange deficit was between HK$ 16.2 billion and the bond gain of HK$ 9.7 billion, which decreased by 24 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively, by a quarter, mainly reflecting the general increase in the dollar ' s share of major currencies within the season and the 3% increase in the United States rate of interest rate in mid-September.
Foreign exchange funds are mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Since 1983, Hong Kong has had a system of associated exchange rates pegged to the United States dollar.
With regard to the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Deok-hyun claims that economic and asset market uncertainty has increased and downside risks have increased, but that Hong Kong ' s financial system is robust and defensive and earthquake-resistant.
" Hong Kong has a strong international investment position, with a net external asset of $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, 2.5 times more than Singapore and 0.6 times more than Japan, and is more than able to cope with the down-cycle or reversal of the economy ... "
The recent recovery of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate and the expansion of the United States dollar spread, according to Chen Deok-chun, indicate that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate rose by more than 400 basis points on 21 September, and that the market is generally considered to be mainly associated with the increase in the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, which then hovered at a level around 7.80-7.84, and continued to fall into the recent Hong Kong dollar dollar interest rate, with a widening spread with the United States dollar, may attract market sales, increase the arbitrage of the dollar, and give the Hong Kong dollar a greater chance than in the previous period to trigger a weaker exchange guarantee.
But he is of the view that, as the Hong Kong Bank’s interest rate normalizes as it begins its interest cycle, future Hong Kong dollar interest rates below the United States dollar will change.
" There will be a greater convergence between Hong Kong dollar and United States dollar interest rates, and there will be a need for more careful risk management and preparedness to cope with market fluctuations ... "
As the Hong Kong dollar is well-funded, the Hong Kong dollar has fallen further, with the rate falling from 0.9% to 2.08179% per week in three months, and the difference with the United States dollar has increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month rate has been reduced by five months and the difference with the United States dollar has increased from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar was close to 7.85 to $1 for most of the time.
During this period, the weak exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August after it was triggered for the first time in April, as a result of, inter alia, arbitrage activities and the release of some of the funds from the large unit after the closure of the operation.
The Authority buys the HK$ 7.85 at the level of the ACV to purchase the US$ in order to maintain the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate stability.
The Authority bought about HK$52.1 billion in May and August under a weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Does the new tax code have any advantages for people outside the country?
In response to a question from a journalist on 30 March, the relevant head of the Ministry of Finance, Tax Administration, stated that, in order to maintain policy stability, consideration would be given to continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Australia, in the next implementation of the new Personal Income Tax Act.
According to a journalist, the new revised Personal Income Tax Act adjusts the criteria for taxing our personal income tax residents from one full year to 183 days.
Are there any preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Macao, at the next stage of the implementation of the Act?
In response, the Officer-in-Charge stated that the regulations in force for the implementation of the Personal Income Tax Act provide for special advantages in the area of taxation of persons outside China, and that persons who have no residence in China but live for a period of more than one year and less than five years, who derive their income from outside China, may pay personal income tax only in respect of the portion paid by units or individuals in China.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the continuation of preferential arrangements for persons abroad, including Hong Kong/Australians, would be considered in the next steps in the implementation of the new Personal Income Tax Act.
There's no "threshold" at the Sunshine Center: Quality certification leads to higher quality.
With the two-child economy, the mother-and-child market boomed from the north to the three-and-four-line cities, a variety of places have been set up.
At the time, the burning Tsukiko society had met the consumption needs of the population, with fees ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, but at the same time it was in an awkward position where there was no threshold and there was a gap in supervision.
The National Directorate of Market Supervision recently launched a series of national "Quality Months" in 2018, in which journalists visited a five-star Moon and Son Centre in Tianjin City to visit the mother and child care service certification experience.
General Moon and Son Centres provide services such as neonatal care, feeding, post-partum plastic repair, etc.
In this Tsukiko Centre, journalists have seen nurses check their newborns daily to breastfeed and professional nurses provide the newborns with delicate care services such as bathing, touching and so forth.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, services ranging from primary and post-mutual care to physical care, such as the provision of Chinese medical treatment for beauty and so forth, help mothers to recover their positions.
A new mother at the house told the reporters that she had been booked at the Tsukiko Club eight months earlier.
The service lines of the Tsukiko Club directly affect the comfort and physical recovery of the mother during her period, and some small Tsukiko Clubs offer only a few simple suco services, which are characterized by irregularities in disinfection, risk of cross-infection, single unscientific diet, etc.
The head of the Tsukiko Center said that they were the only five-star Tsukiko Center in Tianjin that had a B-rated service.
" While some clients initially did not understand the meaning of B-level certification, it was important for the long-term development of the enterprise that they benefit from rigorous and standardized process management of the enterprise through certification. "
Pan Lifan, Deputy Director of the Accreditation Regulatory Department of the General Directorate of National Markets, said that service certification was based on customer perception, a new certification system that focused on organizational quality management and service satisfaction, was an important component of the national quality infrastructure and had a positive impact on increasing the share of quality service delivery and enhancing the international competitiveness of Chinese services.
From 2004 onwards, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone a process of gradual development, with the emergence of a number of influential services such as certification of financial services, certification of mother and child care services, certification of after-sale services, certification of e-commerce services, certification of health services, etc.
According to the National Directorate of Market Supervision, there are currently more than 130 service certification bodies, more than 2,000 service certification officers and nearly 8,000 valid certifications.
Pandréphine stated that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of certification of services, to gradually expand the coverage of certification of services in the areas of health, education, sports, finance, electricity, etc., and to contribute to the reform of the supply side of services and the improvement of quality.
Lotto Hong Kong November 5th - Hong Kong ' s building prices fell two months after the peak, and Hong Kong ' s Financial Authority President Chen Deok-hyun stated on Monday that it would be time to observe whether the building has entered its next cycle, and if it is confirmed that the tightening of countercyclical measures could be considered at the appropriate time.
Chen Deok-hyun also pointed out that if the prices were to be reversed, the first impact would be on those who would be employed during the peaks of the market, but that it was expected that, as in the Asian financial turmoil of 1997, the prices would fall sharply, and the chances for citizens to cut their prices for sale would be much lower.
Chen Deok-hoon led several senior members of the Authority to the Legislative Council briefing, saying that if the market were to enter a downward cycle, it would be possible to relax measures in due course.
"But now only a few weeks of data, it's still too early to relax, and it's still a little more time to see if the market is going into the next cycle... "
Since October 2009, the Authority has so far introduced eight rounds of countercyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages in a variety of properties, including reducing the number of mortgages and requiring strict stress testing for mortgage applicants, in order to improve bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest-rate cycle, the price index for private residential buildings in Hong Kong peaked for two months in August-September, and the monthly fall in September increased to 1.44 per cent.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of the year was 10.2%.
According to the FDA, the financial position of households that measure Hong Kong ' s resilience to financial risks remains healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households living in their own homes without mortgages reached 66 per cent, which is higher than the average of 60 per cent in 2009-11; the average number of mortgages released and the average number of new mortgages paid to interest was 47 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively, which is a significant improvement over the 64 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, in 2009-11.
But Chen Deok-hyun says that the high resilience does not mean that already employed citizens will not be harmed by economic downturns, because property valuation will fall and those who buy buildings at peaks will be the first to suffer.
Although the Superintendency tightens bank lending to mortgage lenders, the builders can also obtain high mortgage lending through mortgage insurance or mortgage lending by developers.
Chen Deok-hyun stated that borrowers could have a mortgage of 85-90 per cent now, along with mortgage lending to developers, and that if the price of the building fell by 10 per cent, negative assets (i.e. the value of the property fell below the total amount of outstanding mortgage loans) would appear.
However, the Vice-President of the Authority, Nguyen Guo-chun, pointed out that the authorities estimated that the high number of mortgages provided by developers represented only 2-2.5 per cent of the total bank mortgages and remained low.
At the peak of Hong Kong ' s negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, representing 22 per cent of the population providing buildings.
By the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets in seven consecutive seasons.
On October 1st, Xinhua announced another wave of tax returns on October 1st, including VAT, excise tax exemptions, etc.
The Ministry of Finance, the General State Tax Administration, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Customs Administration have recently issued a joint communication clarifying the export of goods that have not been validly certified for entry to the electronic commerce complex for the exporter ' s enterprise, as well as the application of the value-added tax and excise tax exemption policy, if the following conditions are met:
First, e-commerce exporting enterprises are registered in the test area and the export date is registered on the Integrated Service Platform on the trans-border e-commerce line of the place of registration, the name of the goods, the unit of measure, the quantity, the unit price, the amount ...
Second, the export of goods is declared through the customs authorities of the region where the test is carried out.
Thirdly, exported goods are not those of the Ministry of Finance and the General Tax Administration which, by decision of the State Council, expressly eliminates the export of (exempted) tax refunds.
The circular clearly states that the General Customs Administration regularly transmits electronic information on e-commerce export declaration lists to the National Tax Administration.
The tax authorities of the pilot regions have strengthened the tax-free management of export goods on the basis of electronic information on the export goods declaration list, which has been drawn up by the National Tax Administration Directorate.
The circular states that specific tax-free management schemes are developed by the provincial tax authorities, the commercial sector ...
Offices of the Leading Group and business authorities in the Cymposia should integrate inter-departmental communication and related policy implementation, accelerate the establishment of a statistical monitoring system for e-commerce exports and promote the rapid development of e-commerce health across borders.
On November 5th, China's new Internet Eldos (Zhang Linhu) split the distribution of money, and a man from Liaoning province killed his lover and dumped him, then fled to the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia.
On 5 May, journalists were informed by the Public Security Bureau of the East Shogun district of Ordos city in Inner Mongolia that the man had been successfully captured after a joint investigation by the two police forces.
On June 26th, 2018, a woman disappeared in the city of Riaoning, and her family called the local police.
After a police investigation, this is not a simple case of a missing person, who is at great risk of being killed by one of the lovers, and the police set up a task force to investigate it further.
On October 30th, the task force discovered that the suspect, Wang, might be hiding in the East Shogun district of Ordos, and that Dong-sung police immediately organized an intensive police force to cooperate fully with Liaoning police in the investigation of the case.
After five days of reconnaissance, the civilian police finally identified Wang's location and combed the details of his associates.
On November 4th, the two police forces joined forces to capture the suspect Wang at an excavator fittings shop in Dong Shing District.
According to Wang, he had a relationship with the victim, and because his sister had a large sum of money that she had left in her name, they decided to take it.
On June 22, 2018, when Wang and Baek Hoon disagreeed on the disposition of the money, Wang Ho will then kill him in the rental house, decompose the body and dump it.
So far, the suspect Wang has been handed over to Liaoning Mount Police.
"The Five Developments, the Great Emblems" Green Development operates on the action train.
The second column of the theme train, "The Five Developments, The Good Emblems", - the theme train "Green Development in Action" was officially launched on the fifth day.
In order to give a full view of the remarkable results of the "Five Developments, Good Emblems" project, Hopper Market Track, together with Kim Chang Media Technology, designed the theme train series "Five Developments, Good Emblems".
Among them, the first train - the "Innovation Development in Action" theme train - was officially launched on October 1st, on the 1st of October, on line 1 of the Hopper Market Orbital Traffic Line.
The main theme train on the line picked the blue and green tone of mountain water, reflecting the birth machine, the energy and the purity.

On October 1st, October 1st, the first day of the Chinese National Day's Golden Week and the last day of the Hong Kong National Day public holidays, many Mainlanders used their holidays to travel and shop abroad, many Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong on that day, and there was a crowd boom at Shenzhen's ports and 22 new self-help routes were opened at Lake Luo and Shenzhen Bay ports to improve customs efficiency and facilitate efficient and rapid customs clearance for passengers.
According to data from Shenzhen Border Control Station, as of 16 p.m., there were more than 429,000 arrivals and departures at Shenzhen border crossing, and more than 168,000 traffic vehicles (a ship, rail, column) and ports remained busy and undisturbed, maintaining a good order of entry and exit.
It is understood that, as a result of a number of positive factors, including the increase in the number of countries providing exit waivers for Chinese citizens, the number of tourists travelling to Europe and South-East Asia on vacations during the national holiday has continued to increase.
In the early morning hours of the morning, Rhoko, Shenzhen Bay, the Emperor, Fukuda and others came up with a peak in passenger flow, which lasted from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and from 6.30 a.m. to 13 p.m. at Shenzhen Bay.
It was explained that, in response to the peak in the flow of passengers/cars entering and leaving the country, Shenzhen Border Control Station, in accordance with the National Immigration Administration, had been deployed in a unified manner, had initiated a bus/car-flow peak-hour service model, arranged overtime police to support the line of duty, had been able to move in advance to and from the screening route, guided passengers, and had been scheduled to ensure that Chinese citizens were in line for entry/exit customs clearance for no more than 30 minutes, taking into account the efficiency of customs clearance for foreigners; and had strengthened the maintenance of order in areas with high concentrations of people, ensuring that customs clearance was conducted in a safe and orderly manner.
The Shenzhen Border Control Station also reminds passengers entering and leaving the country that prior to their departure, they should be aware of the documents and visas, the period of validity of the bets, the reasonable scheduling of the journeys, as far as possible avoiding peak hours, the selection of the right time and the right port to travel.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong by the Guang Dynasty are required to have valid entry/exit documents and visas. The ticket is only a car ticket and cannot be used as an entry/exit document. If they are unable to travel to Hong Kong for reasons such as non-conformity with the documents, they should follow the guidelines of the Border Guard Police and wait at a designated location for Hong Kong Railways staff to take them back to Hong Kong.
The systematic red hemorrhoids are a chronic and muscular disease that was once considered an incurable disease.
Because of the unknown mechanism of the disease, the difficulty of treating it and the lack of effective treatment, it is impossible to cure it.
In recent days, a joint team of researchers from the University of Tsinghua School of Life Sciences, Liu Wanli, and the Director of the Rhodwe Immunization Centre of the Beijing People ' s Hospital, Chestnut, have discovered the presence of molecular variations that increase systemic red weasel susceptibility to human immunoglobin proteins, and the involvement of this variant in the management of immuno-B cells.
In short, the two teams have confirmed that an abnormal immunosuppression in the human body is a major cause of systemic red leprechaun haemorrhoids.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaoxiang, a team from the Grand North People ' s Hospital collected and researched nearly 2,000 large samples of systematic erythalamus and found that patients with immunoglobin mutation had a wide range of pathogenesis and a large number of their own antibodies, kidneys, arthritis, menmitis, and vascular diseases.
The Liu Wanli team, through various research methods, such as immunocellular trace, animal testing, sequencing and so on, discovered that this immuno-molecular mutation activates the immuno-signal route and promotes a mechanism for the spread of multiple self-antibodies by B cells.
Journalists have learned that the two teams are so strong that they can take advantage of each other that they have a strong link between basic research and clinical applications.
The Liu Wanli team is committed to Blymphocyte Immunisation, Immunoactive Research, and the Chestnut Country Team is engaged in systematic clinical research on red weeds.
" This study is one of the results of years of collaboration between the two teams and is the first time that the academic community has been institutionally aware that immunoglobin genetic anomalies will induce systemic red hemorrhoids and provide a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeting ... "
It's not short. It's legal.
The lawyer's in court with the axe?
At first glance, the news was exciting, and it blew up in the legal world.
The Central Law of Fujian Quan City subsequently fined the lawyers involved $500 and recommended in writing that the Bar Association of Quan Quan conduct an investigation.
According to the newspaper, the former Quancheng City Bar issued an official circular stating that the lawyers ' actions did not involve violations of the law and were not punishable under the law.
According to multiple reports, the Quancheng City Bar did not deal with short-term or confrontations, but was approved by the Quancheng Central Court.
An event that could have caused tension within the legal community was finally properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete return to the truth: the axe that the lawyer in question was carrying was identical to the murder weapon of the accused, of the same type, but did not open it, merely to adduce evidence at the testimonial, without intimidation or with the subjective intent of "dangering the safety of the court".
There are four very important details to be taken into account in determining whether the lawyer in question acted in violation of the law: first, the previous two sessions of the local court, where only a photograph of the axe was shown, and the need to present the axe was justified from the point of view of the defence; second, the axe was purchased only one hour before the hearing, not because the lawyer was unwilling to seek the consent of the judge, but because the judge was not objectively contacted; third, the whole axe was not used excessively or inappropriately; and fourth, the lawyer in question made a public error at the first time and apologized to the court.
The combination of these circumstances shows that the lawyer in question "with an axe" is not guilty, it's just a defense.
After clarifying the whole story, the Spring County City Council decided not to push the water, but to hold back the pressure and decide not to punish.
And this decision can stand the test of fact and law.
As for bringing to court an axe as a control knife without the permission of the court, there is a real risk of confusion and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, the previous fines and judicial advice of the Chuen County Central Court are also indefensible.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and to prevent individual courts from harassing lawyers, the Supreme Law issued in 2014 the " Rules on Security of the Judicial Police of the People ' s Court " , establishing the principle that a physical examination is not required for lawyers to appear in court.
Since the issuance of the Rules, lawyers have led by example, and there have been few incidents of security breaches that have jeopardized the security of the Tribunal.
In rare cases like Quanzhou, misunderstandings can only be eliminated if they are communicated in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulatory organization of the legal profession, has the dual mission of disciplining injustice and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual LAOs have suffered from ill-health due to their bias towards discipline and lack of security.
And the decisions of the Quan State Council, both in terms of process and outcome, are commendable and set an example for more of them to do their job properly.
From October 1st, which tax revenues will affect our money bags?
The new Personal Income Tax Act of 1 October (Reporter Sang-hoon) in Shanghai, Xinhua, will be in effect as of 1 January 2019. In order to enable the general population to benefit from the tax reduction bonus as soon as possible, the tax pay earned by taxpayers will be deducted from the starting point of $5,000 per month and the new scale will apply.
With the New Deal coming to the ground, what are the advantages that will affect the people's money bags?
The profit is one: there's a significant tax reduction on wages.
Taxpayers who receive wages after 1 October can deduct the basic deduction of $5,000 per month and apply the new scale, with most taxpayers having varying degrees of tax relief, especially for low- and middle-income people.
According to the tax credit schedule for the different income groups, the monthly income after the deduction of the "three-risk one" amounts to $8,000, $10,000, $50,000, and the tax liability amounts to $90, $290, $1590,900, respectively. The corresponding tax deductions were 73.9 per cent, 61.1 per cent, 49.0 per cent, 18.8 per cent, respectively, compared to the starting point of $3,500.
It is worth noting that, for holiday reasons, the new basic fee- and tax-free schedule could be applied to the salaries paid by the units at the end of September, which were legally due in October.
To this end, the customer withholding software used by the tax authorities has provided the corresponding tax calculation functionality, but the corresponding tax has to be declared within the statutory filing period ...
Good two: low-tax slots are significantly larger.
In addition to raising the threshold, the new scale will apply as of 1 October.
In this salary, the seven-tier tax rate on salary earned has remained unchanged, but there has been a marked change in the tax scale, with 3 per cent, 10 per cent, 20 per cent of the low-rate range, 25 per cent of the lower rate range, and 30 per cent, 35 per cent, 45 per cent of the higher rate range.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the tax rates for all stages of production operations, with the lower limit of 35 per cent of the maximum range being raised from $100,000 to $500,000.
This means that individual businesses, individual partnerships, will benefit from tax changes.
" The previous period ' s measurement of individual tax cuts for Shanghai taxpayers shows that a large number of taxpayers will be fully aware of the dividends of the tax reforms, particularly the significant size of the tax cuts for low- and middle-income groups ... "
Ranmin, head of the personal income tax division of the Shanghai City Tax Office of the National Tax Administration.

A tripartite trade agreement between the United States of America and the United States of America would open up new opportunities for 500 million people.
According to foreign media reports, a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Friland and United States trade representative Lettheiser, published on the Canadian Government website, states that the United States, Canada and Mexico have reached a tripartite trade agreement, which will be known as the " USMCA " (the United States-Mega Trinational Agreement).
Previously, CTV News Canada quoted senior American sources as saying that Canada and the United States had overcome their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post quoted two well-informed sources who reported that the 30 September agreement between the United States and Canada would retain the North American Free Trade Agreement as a tripartite trade agreement and that the heads of the three countries would sign a new agreement within two months.
The statement stated: " Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement - the " USMCA " - which will provide our workers, farmers and companies with a high standard of trade agreement that will lead to more freer markets, fairer trading and more sustainable economic growth ... which will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs and bring about 500 million people new opportunities. "
It is known that the current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in 1994 by the United States, Mexico and Canada.
After Trump took office, he announced plans to reconsider the agreement and sign a new one.
The three countries started this negotiation process in 2017.
On the morning of the local time, the results of the early Okinawa election of the governor, who died of the illness of the former chairman, were announced and Danny Yu, who was opposed to the plan to relocate the American military base in Japan, was elected.
The election was conducted on 30 September, and the results show that Jade City won a total of 396.632 million votes, with the largest number of votes in Okinawa County’s election history, more than 80,000 votes more than the main contender, Sawa Jin-sun.
Four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24 per cent, a decrease of 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 election of governors in Okinawa County.
On 1st day, Jade City stated to the media that the election results showed that the people of the county did not want to let Young-General's efforts go to waste, and that he would continue to work against the U.S. military base relocation plan and the closing of the Universal Base with the governments of Japan and the United States.
The U.S. military base, located in Yino Bay, Okinawa County, has been suffering from a long history of illness, and the Japanese and American governments agreed to relocate it to the area of the city of Gokkkor, but the population of Okinawa strongly opposed the move in order to move the base out of Okinawa.
On the other hand, with regard to the relocation plan, which was strongly opposed by the people of the county, and the withdrawal of the request for permission to land in the open coast, Jade City stated that he had not been at first in opposition to and divided with the central Government, hoping that the two sides would have a full exchange of views and demonstrate their intention to resolve the dispute through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also stated to the media in the morning that he took this outcome seriously and would work hard to revive Okinawa and ease the burden on the base.
In a press conference on 1 January, Japanese Chief Executive Minister Yiwei said that there had been no change in the government's approach to the relocation of American military bases as soon as possible.
At the same time, he expressed his desire to talk to Jade City.
Jade City will take office as Governor of Okinawa County on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oil seeds grew, Paul Thomas, a North Dakota farmer in the United States, planted more and more soybeans in his land.
This shift peaked this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, on an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him are planning to replant their former primary crops in the US agricultural zone by 2019: corn and wheat.
American farmers are growing more soybeans this year than corn, for the first time in 35 years.
The plan to switch to other food crops is due to the difficulties faced by American farmers in selling soybeans in the context of the trade war waged by United States President Trump against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of the soybeans exported by the United States, but in recent months, trade wars have led to almost zero purchases of soybeans, causing soybeans prices to fall to 10 years of low prices.
Thomas is planning to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing dependence on crops that depend on China's demand.
Thomas says that soybean prices "have hit us hard."
He stated that without Chinese demand, the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per bot, while the necessary price for the cover cost was $8.50.
American farmers have recorded a record level of soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is expected to be a record high.
At a time when they were vulnerable to shocks, they were hit by a trade war.
In July, China imposed import duties on imports of United States soybeans in response to Trump ' s tariff on imports of Chinese goods.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will issue its first estimate of the area to be planted next year, which is expected to include considerations of tariff implications.
The estimate is expected to confirm the expected reduction in soybean seeding by civil institutions.
According to a report seen by Reuters, on October 19, Informa Economics projected an increase of 4 to 92.7 million acres in maize cultivation in 2019 (37.5 million hectares) and a reduction of 7 to 83 million acres in soybean cultivation.
Informa also predicts a 4% increase in wheat cultivation in the United States.
The area of soybeans planted before retaliatory customs duties rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million more than 10 years ago.
Corn cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008, to 89.1 million acres, and this year it has grown to 47.8 million acres of wheat, almost the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Growing Association, owns 3,600 acres. This year, he spends almost half of his total area on soybeans, but plans to cut it down in the future.
He claims that he may have increased maize cultivation by up to 20 per cent on his farm in northern Illinois, which is the largest soybean growing state in the United States.
Soybeans are lower than maize per acre, but less fertilizer is required, which makes soybeans generally less expensive to grow.
If farmers move to final maize, costs may increase, but some businesses, including Andersons Inc fertilizer sellers, will benefit.
CEO Andersons Pat Bowe said to Reuters that he expected that the conversion of corn would facilitate fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of corn to farmers.
A press conference was held on 29 September by Sutilawa, Director-General of the Airport Authority of Bangkok, Thailand, to apologize for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport and to say that Thailand welcomed Chinese tourists and that the authorities concerned would strengthen their management, raise awareness of services and avoid similar incidents.
According to reports, there was a physical conflict between the security guards at the airport at Chanman and a Chinese man who had been denied entry.
Sutilava said that security-related acts were serious violations, that the Airport Authority had suspended him and that a Board of Inquiry had been set up to investigate the matter, and that the security guard would be dismissed if it was true.
The Thai Immigration Service has arranged for the man to return to China.
Sutilawa apologizes for this incident, which is damaging to the image of Thailand, and states that the Thai side attaches great importance to the matter and is willing to do its utmost to reduce the impact of the incident on hit tourists, and will send a letter of apology to the client through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that Shimaman Airport was willing to facilitate Chinese visitors to Thailand and that Thai immigration authorities had set up special access routes for Chinese tourists at the five major international airports in Bangkok, Suwanapur, Chanaman, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Hoai.
He said that the airport authority would next overhaul the landing area to indicate the landing fees and improve staff quality of services and communication capabilities.
When the Chinese Embassy in Thailand learned of the incident, it first contacted the person in question to find out what was going on.
At the same time, the head of the Thai Immigration Service, the Airports Administration, the Ministry of Tourism and Sports has made representations to the Thai authorities to investigate the incident thoroughly and to punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side to deal with the matter properly and to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the persons concerned.
Xinhua International Times Review: Defending Multilateralism, China is one.
At a time when unilateralism is on the rise, international rules and the multilateral order are under attack.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible major Power, China, with its grandness, its philosophy and firmness of action, joins the international community in preserving multilateralism and promoting its continued progress.
In the face of the new challenges of the new situation, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As Wang Yi, Secretary of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should be based on cooperation and win-winness, a rule-based order based on equity and justice, and oriented towards effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global architecture for development cooperation, with the United Nations at its core and North-South cooperation as its main channel, complemented by South-South cooperation, and for all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's reflections and voices reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As President Espinosa of the 73rd session of the General Assembly said, under the present circumstances, " the United Nations needs more than ever to promote multilateralism and preserve a rules-based international system " .
The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Lagarde, stated that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to the rules of international trade and resolve differences through negotiations.
In recent years, the rise of groups of emerging markets and developing countries, accompanied by adjustments in the political forces of the global economy, has played a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms and provided a new impetus to development in the face of a negative climate of multilateralism.
From this perspective, China is advocating the idea of building a large family rather than a small circle, insisting on multilateralism, such as co-conforming rather than a winner-take-all, in keeping with the trend of the times, which is the inevitable option for addressing global challenges and solving world problems, representing the common aspirations of most of the world ' s nations.
There's an advanced philosophy, more solid action.
China's "One Way Forward" initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched the "one way forward" in the construction of international and regional cooperation initiatives, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the "16+1 Cooperation", to promote international regional cooperation, to perfect and complement existing international regimes and order, to bring about a new dynamic of multilateralism and cooperation, and to contribute to the advancement of the international order towards a more just and rational development.
As the guardian of the international order and the practice of multilateralism, China's actions are becoming stronger in this multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices for international hotspots to address climate change, participation in peacekeeping operations, efforts to reduce poverty and contribute to the implementation of the 2030 sustainable development agenda in other countries.
As United Nations Secretary-General Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the "trust deficit" facing the world increases, when populism and polarization rise, it is the world's most pressing need for multilateral cooperation.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to work together to translate consensus into action, to firmly defend multilateralism and to work together to build a community of human destiny.

The fifth "Disabled Voices Month" is here to focus on sexuality education for disabled adolescents - the New China Network.
In recent years, the topic of sex education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenges for young people with disabilities remain daunting.
Recently, a seminar on comprehensive sexuality education challenges and practical strategies for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
Sex education for children and young people with disabilities was an important topic of this seminar.
The report on sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of disabled children and young people in China, published at the conference, shows that children with disabilities are sexually harassed, with a higher rate of sexual abuse than healthy children.
For disabled children and adolescents, the social focus is also "sexual protection".
The aim of this seminar is to promote comprehensive sexuality education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China in the areas of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support to children and adolescents with disabilities at their source, so that they have the same right to enjoy love as others.
According to the experts, the public awareness of disabled groups in Chinese society has remained at a level that has not gone far enough.
China ' s comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities, especially children and adolescents, is not sufficiently thorough, influenced by such factors as traditional attitudes.
In recent years, however, with the support of UNESCO and the public interest, China has seen a welcome development in the full cycle of comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and pathways for persons with disabilities.
The report shows that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical impairments, while having greater difficulty in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationships than the general population, are generally well advanced and enriched.
Seminar on Challenges and Practical Strategies for Comprehensive Sex Education for Persons with Disabilities, organized by the Shanghai Foundation for People with Disabilities and co-sponsored by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International League for the Handicapped (France) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Representative Office in Beijing, in the context of China's health strategy, to discuss the full cycle of comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and pathways for persons with disabilities, to promote policy makers in the field of special education and inclusive education, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents' representatives, etc., on the international policy on comprehensive sexuality education and the right to health of children and young people with disabilities; to engage in a broad exchange of sex education practices, strategies, challenges and resources for children and young people with disabilities in the country, to discuss and develop a blueprint for future comprehensive sexuality education for children and young people with disabilities, and to develop support networks.
Reuters Beijing, September 30 - The Central Bank of China announced on Sunday the data on scheduled short-term net outflows of foreign currency assets, showing that at the end of August this year, the central bank's foreign currency position in respect of forward and futures contracts was zero for 12 months, and that month was still low.
According to the Central Bank's previous data, as of the end of August last year, the Bank had an empty foreign currency position of $6,044 million in forward and futures contracts, the fourth consecutive month; the size of the empty position in SDR terms was 4,276 million SDRs.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange position has been zero in the long run.
The Central Bank released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data show that at the end of February 2016, the Central Bank ' s foreign currency had more than $2.438 billion in multiple positions on forward and futures contracts and $28.9 billion in empty positions.
For the first time, September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of $16,401 million to $45,301 million.
The Central Bank has previously stated that the forward and futures positions of foreign currency vis-à-vis domestic currency mainly reflect the foreign exchange forward operations that the Central Bank conducts with commercial banks to meet the foreign currency liability hedging needs of enterprises, and will continue to provide long-term risk avoidance products on the basis of demand, which will have less impact on the size of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20th, K158 train went to the crane wall in Chengzhou.
One of the masters on the train bought no ticket, but took her seat: " Shoot it up."
Two hours' drive, the trainmaster advised him that one hour was not valid.
In the end, a male passenger in the same car couldn't watch and pull him up.
From the point of view of truth, although most of the end result is that the hegemonics are condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security services, and even included in a blacklist of good faith, the public still feels that they do not "register": why should he not be punished on the spot?
Why not stop their immoral or even unlawful behaviour on the spot and punish it afterwards?
And why is it a male passenger who pulls him up because he's not on the road?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police officers, who generally do not; even when they do, the police are concerned about possible rogue reactions from the hegemonics and do not take measures to force them to leave.
Repeated hegemonic incidents have made people aware of the need for hegemonics to be forcibly removed and even punished on the spot in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that the police on our train take strong measures in a timely manner, and that unattended trains be equipped as soon as possible to secure the timely cessation and suppression of violations.
On 1 October, on the first day of the national holiday, there was a surge of vehicles in the direction of the Sichuan Kitagawa Autonomous District to Songpan, Mau County.
At around 1300 hours, the Northgawa Traffic Police received a telephone call stating that his family had been in a traffic accident in Matsupan and that, owing to the limited medical conditions in the area, there was an urgent need to be sent to Myeongyang for treatment.
At the same time, a one-way traffic control was introduced on the Tang's Sanse Lake Loch Road in Kitagawa. I'd like to ask the traffic police to release the 120 ambulance.
Upon receipt of a call for help, the police officer on duty promptly reported the matter to the brigade, and once Chief Huang learned the matter briefly, he arranged for the police officer on duty at the control point to contact the helper and ask for a full escort.
" There were more than 1,000 vehicles entering the control section at the time, and after contacting the 120 first aid vehicle, it was expected that we would arrive in Kitagawa at around 1500 hours and that we would immediately arrange for deployment ... "
Lieutenant Commander Zhou Wei of the Kitagawa Police Department introduced the need for a first aid vehicle to cross the Tang Jia Shanxi Lake Loch Road and the narrowness of the road. To prevent parallel lines of vehicles that have already entered this route, the traffic police are on the road at the beginning of an hour, with three points in the end, and all passing drivers are reminded to move the side of the road to the wrong car for the first aid vehicle.
Subsequently, the squadron of the drum squadron also temporarily stopped the vehicle from entering the control section and lined up for the incoming 120 first aid vehicles.
At around 1500 hours, a Kawakawa-san-licensed ambulance drove into Kitagawa, where a police car was sent to escort the ambulance across the control section.
It is understood that only one vehicle will pass through some of the areas on the Lake Road, where the civilian police have pre-empted temporary controls, ensuring the smooth passage of 120 first aid vehicles.
Upon arrival at the village of Ten Mile, the traffic police made early contact with the village council, borrowed the village road and prohibited the entry of social vehicles.
"It took only 40 minutes to get a 120 ambulance from the Kitagawa Traffic Police to the normal road into 302. "
Wei said it would take four hours for the entire passage, as a matter of course.
" This arrangement has successfully secured valuable treatment time for the patient ... "
It is known that at 1720 hours, seriously ill patients were sent on time to Yenyang for treatment.

The Beijing Morning Reporter saw that the civilian police seized $800 in cash from a suspected thief.
"They took the money from the passenger's pocket."
Civilians pointed to a broken jacket pocket and said, " They cut the place open and stole $800 from a tourist who came to Kyoto. When we caught them, the money was just put in their own pocket. "
The reporter learned that civilian police officers in plain clothes had followed them for an hour and had finally been caught while they were doing the crime.
Two suspects are currently under police review.
The civilian police in plain clothes told reporters who was suspicious in the crowd, which was a simple question for the civilian police.
"As many thieves are caught, they look at people differently from ordinary passengers, who, in addition to staring at people ' s pockets and backpacks, prefer to drill in crowds instead of hiding from people. "
Civilians also told reporters that suspects often wait for cars without purpose, like to wander around the station and find someone to steal them.
"It's all a matter of experience. It's dry and dry, and you'll know it."
In addition, the civilian police advised that " the outer garments are the most convenient and the most vulnerable to theft ... "
Be careful with your belongings while you're in the car, in case you're stolen.

The Mandatory National Standard "Synthetic Fields of Material for Primary and Secondary Schools" was drafted by the Ministry of Education with the participation of 26 research institutes and testing agencies, after more than two years of revision, during which more than 100 expert meetings were organized, as well as country-wide field visits, sample tests, and the collection of numerous validation experiments on hundreds of businesses in the market.
According to the old State marker of 2005, journalists have found that the new national marker has not only changed from a " national recommended standard " to a " national mandatory standard " , but has also added a number of elements, including thickness requirements, physical performance, age-resilient performance, inorganic filling requirements, high mass content requirements for smoother particles, limits on hazardous substances for surface finished products, limits on hazardous substances for non-solid and solid raw materials, etc.
In particular, it is worth mentioning that the new national sign limits the amount of hazardous substances that may be produced in the construction of the school's plastic runway from the original 7 to 18 items, and sets the amount of volatile organic matter in the built runway in accordance with the domestic standards.
If the release of hazardous substances is specified in the "Limitation and odour requirements for hazardous substances in ready-to-drink and prefabricated surface products", the total volatile organic compound shall not exceed 5 mg/m3, formaldehyde shall not exceed 0.4 mg/m3, carbon dioxide shall not exceed 7 mg/m3, benzene shall not exceed 0.1 mg/m3 and the odour level shall not exceed 3 levels.
The new national logo also elaborates on sampling requirements for plastic runways in primary and secondary schools, test rules, sentencing rules, etc.
In addition, the campus's artificial lawn was included for the first time in the compulsory testing of the national standard.
In the near future, special deployments will be made for the implementation of the new national logo, which will be submitted to the Department of Physical Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education during the year.
On September 30th, Chinese customer Chengdu played the National Ping Civil War at the Women's World Cup finals in 2018.
In the end, Zhu Rainling, a teammate who fought in the main field at 4.0 a.m., took the title of the Women's Ping World Cup again four years later, the twenty-first time the Chinese woman's ping took the crown of the match.
Dinning and Zhu Yu Ling are teammates and friends, both of whom are quite familiar with each other's tactics.
Whether they're ready to fight or warm up before the race, both sides follow each other.
Entering the finals, the two of them said they had finished the game.
But the match between Tinning and Chu Rainling is a sword-sword.
In the first round, the winner of the first three-to-one round, and then Zhu Raining's three-square-square-out with Tinning's mistakes.
Then Zhu Rain Ling's mistakes in the attack began to increase, and Dinning took the opportunity and took the lead at 3:5 and took the lead at 10:6.

In the end, Dinning won the third personal World Cup champion, Joo-Lin, who was satisfied with her performance: " A champion is important to every athlete...
I didn't think of that before the race, but I said that one game goes, and the finals are quite satisfactory. "
When Joo-Lin, the main battler, harvested a silver medal, failed to achieve the goal of defending the crown, and when she spoke about whether the enthusiastic viewers in the home were putting invisible pressure on themselves, she said, " I think I can handle the whole game in terms of pressure, and Dinning is doing a great job today, so he never found the rhythm. "
Invigorating rural consumption requires normalization mechanisms to clean up markets, guide demand for healthy consumption and improve farmers ' access to consumption.
According to the data, the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, with retail sales of rural consumer goods growing 10.5 per cent in the first half of the year, which is 1.3 percentage points higher than in towns.
In a poor village in one of the western districts, there was only one convenience store in the village, and some of the products seemed to have known each other. The "Gold Dragonfish" was marked as "Gold Dragon Oil", the "Wing Boy" as a "Big Milk", and the "Big Mountain" was a lot of stuff.
Over the years, similar phenomena have become more frequent, with some of the country's poor trade nameplates, similar names, similar packagings, and falsifying reality.
A consumption survey published in one of the cities in the west found that rural traders had a serious problem with over-shams, with 66 per cent of users buying fakes in supermarkets below the township line, of which more than half were food items.
Why is Li's name still on the rise?
Unlike the urban market, farmers are less aware of their rights, and are left in a blind zone where the power of regulation is not strong enough, giving fertile ground to counterfeit goods.
A commodity with multiple headpipes, some sectors run prices, some managed production, some managed markets, some cross-cutting functions, annual vacations, concentrated on the wind, fake goods escaped the wind, came out slowly, just after the old days, new fakes came out.
The lack of long-term regulatory mechanisms, the impurity of rural markets, the low cost of violations and the high stakes have led to the emergence of "uphills" and "downhills" by illegal traders, with some rural areas becoming "disposed".
From food to health, the majority of farmers are moving towards development consumption.
Recently, the Party Centre, the State Council, issued a number of opinions on improving the institutional mechanisms for promoting consumption and further boosting the consumption potential of the population, in which it was proposed to promote the upgrading of the consumption ladder for rural residents, with the aim of enabling large numbers of farmers to " consume " , " consume " , " consume " and " consume " , so that rural consumption can really flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen reforms to eliminate market regulation and regulation, multiple regulatory weaknesses, adaptation, sound food safety, product quality monitoring networks, and the shrinking of rural areas' space for fake production and sale.
On the other hand, greater enforcement of the law and the regulation of the capillary veins must not be allowed to spread in rural areas.
Heavy punishment of pit farmers, however hidden they may be, should not be used as a justification for the growth of bad commodities, and the authorities concerned should be clear about their responsibilities, the power of grass-roots supervision should sink, and any problem must be brought to account, the fraud maker must be held accountable and the person who sells it has no place to hide.
Strict market access is closed, strict qualification of producers is enforced, markets are closed, products are routed, clean, roots are found at the source, legal distributors are secured and farmers can buy it.
Activate rural consumption and direct the demand for healthy consumption.
As consumption escalates, many farmers not only seek to eat well, but also to live high-quality lives such as culture, health and so on, they can't put the rural market on low-quality "cheap" paintings.
This requires promoting e-commerce to extend rural coverage to a wide range of rural areas, opening up two-way distribution channels between urban and rural areas, promoting a combination of off-line industrial development platforms and online power-trading platforms, supporting the expansion of new patterns of consumption to rural markets; promoting the organic integration of commercial logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc., in well-placed townships; and improving modern rural circulation networks, optimizing the integration of storage facilities resources and effectively reducing the cost of rural flows.
Create a clean and secure market environment for the countryside, so that farmers can consume less and more and so that rural consumption can flourish, so that farmers can gain a sense of access to and happiness in their consumption.
With effect from 1 November, we reduced some of our most-favoured-nation (MFN) rates to 7.5 per cent of our total tariff level.
In accordance with the decision of the State Council at its twenty-sixth ordinary session, the State Council Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs issued a bulletin on 1 November 2018 to reduce the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rate for some commodities.
According to the Declaration of the State Council ' s Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs on the Reduction of Tariffs on Imports of Selected Goods, the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rate for certain goods, such as industrial goods, has been reduced as of 1 November this year, in order to adapt to industrial upgrading, lower business costs and meet the demand for multi-level consumption by the population.
The average tax rate fell from 10.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent, with an average reduction of 26 per cent.
This tax is mainly related to textiles; stone, ceramic, glass products; parts of steel and base metals; mechanical and electrical equipment and parts, such as metalworking machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, transmission and transformation equipment, electrical appliances, instrumentation meters, etc.; resource-based goods and primary processed products, such as non-metallic mines, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, stone stones, etc.
At the same time, the tariff rates on imports of imported goods are adjusted downwards with the overall level of customs duties, especially on pharmaceuticals, and the corresponding downward adjustment of the tariff rates on imports of imported goods.
In order to follow up on the Party Central, the State Council's decision-making exercise, the country imposed zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported medicines on 1 May of this year, reduced tariffs on cars and spare parts on 1 July, import duties on some consumer daily goods, and a third-step reduction in information technology agreements for the extension of products.
Journalists learned from the State Council Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs that since this year, following successive autonomous adjustments, our overall tariff level has fallen from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent, an average reduction of 23 per cent.
Appropriate tariff reductions can contribute to the balanced development of external trade and higher levels of external openness, as well as to the integrated use of both domestic and international resources to advance domestic supply-side structural reforms.
According to the relevant head of the Commission, this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the reform and opening up of the country, and the positive reduction of the overall level of tariffs is a practical step towards implementing the spirit of the important statement made by the Secretary-General of Xi at the Boguang Asia Forum, as well as an important step towards further expansion of openness and the proactive expansion of imports in the light of our high-quality development needs. This initiative and initiative demonstrate China ' s firm commitment to a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, while enhancing its own momentum for development, will also allow China ' s development to benefit the world better.
On September 29th, the regional public branding of the Queens of the Rings in Gansu Province was held in the southern Kasai district of Tianjin City.
Red Army millet, black bean, hillboys choreographing Montenegrin goats, fine tea, paper-cut filmbooks, pure hand-made slippers... a piece of well-packed agricultural produce placed on the stage, with a common brand name called "Travellers."
"Building the regional brands of `cuncles' has effectively addressed the development bottlenecks of `silent, small and weak' agricultural products in the ring districts, and has become a powerful vehicle for the fight against poverty." 29th, the regional public brands of `cuncts' agricultural products sponsored by Gansu-circle county were held in the southern Kasai district of Tianjin city.
The county is at the border of the three provinces of Hanqing, as the country ' s state of advanced food production, as the village of China ' s small and groceries, as well as the country ' s long history and wealth of resources.
The lamb, the wine, the noodles, the squeaky face, the smell of the swag that comes to mind when you're in the country.
With China ' s growing urbanization, the urban population is growing rapidly, and a large number of young people in rural areas have left their homes to start urban life.
The Chinese agricultural brand researcher, Yang Jia, said: " Urban life is fast, under stress, and more and more people are beginning to miss rural life as a child, but, " The most beautiful memory that goes back is that of the village " , and the design of the brand of `Travellers' is named for the country and the country of the drifting county " .
The weather conditions are special, the weather is long, the temperature is high, and the conditions for the planting of special groceries are very high.
The country is home to more than 20 small groceries, the country's largest production of small groceries and the highest quality in the country.
Wang Xiao Li, a schoolgirl in Tienjin, took part in the presentation as a volunteer and said: " The natives are the closest, the natives are the best, the `Roadsmen' brand brings us too much home, remembers, is the best food there, and hopes that the `Roadsmen' brand is getting farther away and bigger. "
Dr. Tambin, a researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve Agency, said that the detection data for agricultural products such as rounded grain, bitterness and black bean were particularly powerful through the testing of more than 900 sets of indicators, and that many of the groceries had higher levels of biologically active substances than the standard data, and that the "congers" had the inherent advantage of gaining access to the country's high-end groceries market.
Chai-chun, Secretary of the County Council of the Ring County, said that through the branding of the ring people, it would further enhance the quality, standardization and scale-up of quality agricultural products at the county level, thus contributing to a good overall image of agricultural products at the county level, rapidly raising visibility, competitiveness and value added.
Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2 per cent in July compared to the previous month, an increase that exceeded expectations and raised the market's expectations for the Central Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month.
If it does, it'll be the Central Bank's fifth raise in a little more than a year.
Reuters access analysts had previously estimated an increase of 0.1 per cent.
Statistics Canada reported on Friday that 12 out of 20 industries had experienced growth.
This figure is noteworthy because this year the central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors could delay the third quarter of GDP data.
The President of the Central Bank of Canada, Bolotz, promised on Thursday that the Central Bank would continue to raise interest rates gradually, and would pay close attention to economic data.
The next time the Central Bank of Canada announces interest rates will be on October 24th.
The Central Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 due to the growth of the Canadian economy and near-lower than the record.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist who's been on the macro level, said that the country's economy is expected to grow by about 2 per cent per annum in the third quarter of the year.
"This will be more than 1.5% of what the Central Bank of Canada expected, and will therefore be another reason to expect the Central Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month, " he says in a report.
The overnight index swap shows that the market's forecast for the Central Bank of Canada's October rate has risen from 76.46 per cent to 78.27 per cent.
Korea's first joint expedition to the Han River into the sea in '65.
The Korean Ministry of Defense confirmed on the 5th day that the two Koreas had launched a joint expedition into the waters of the Han River and the Jin River into the sea.
The initiative is an advance preparation to guarantee freedom of navigation for civilian vessels on both sides.
According to a press briefing provided by the Korean Ministry of Defence on the same day, this was the first time that the two sides had conducted a joint inspection of the Han River into the open sea since the signing of the Korean War Armistice Agreement in 1953.
In September this year, the two Koreas signed a military agreement to conduct a joint inspection of the waters of the Han River into the mouth of the sea in order to guarantee environmental protection of the waters and the development of tourism.
In October, the two Koreas planned a joint expedition to the waters at the general level.
On November 5, the joint Korean-Korean water expedition was officially launched.
The joint mission was composed of 20 members of the Korean army, experts and others.
According to the Korean Ministry of Defence, neither party was armed during this mission, and it was prohibited to use words or actions that stimulated each other.
" Because of the absence of a military demarcation line near the entrance to the sea, the area was once an unexpectedly high area, but through joint missions, it will become a new zone of peace in the future ... "
The waters of this joint Korean-Korean expedition are approximately 70 km in length and cover a total area of about 280 km2.
According to the Korean Ministry of Defence, the Korean side will send six cruise ships to explore, inter alia, the depth of the seawater to provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters; until the investigation is completed, navigational maps will be provided for the movement of civilian ships.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea held summit talks in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on the joint use of the Han River and the Jinji River entry into the sea, but the follow-up negotiations were stalled by the tense situation on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed between the two Koreas in September, future ships need to inform each other in advance before sailing in common waters.
On November 5th, the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia reported that Chinese citizens Guo Yuxiang and Mao Yunxin had recently lost contact during their tour.
It is understood that the two men were members of the Blue Sky rescue team, and on October 19, they contacted their relatives and friends in the country, saying that they were about to go into the mountains near Lake Kusugur and share their positions through Twitter, and have since lost contact with them and appear to have gone to the no-man's area.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and interests and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia and to consular protection and assistance.
As soon as we heard that the two tourists had lost contact, the Embassy launched an emergency response plan to secure the gold rescue time and to do its best.
The Embassy maintains close communication with the families of the individuals concerned, assists them in reporting the incident immediately to the police and provides them with the translation list for their choice.
The Embassy met with the Ministry of External Relations of Mongolia, the General Directorate of Police and the Head of the General Directorate of Emergency Situations to inform them of the situation, request them to proceed with the search and rescue as soon as possible and to maintain close communication with them throughout the search and rescue process in order to ensure that the latest developments are kept up to date.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the family in issuing a search for persons in Monhua and China, and extensively mobilized the active involvement of Monghua and Chinese enterprises in tracing people, providing effective leads and providing assistance to several Blue Sky rescue workers who went to Monsanto to assist in the rescue.
With the help of the Embassy, the first rescue team was dispatched and the search-and-rescue fee was promised.
The Mon Police Headquarters and the General Emergency Directorate instructed the police and the emergency department in Kusugur to do their best to search and rescue.
Because of the remoteness of Lake Kusugur at the border with Russia in the north of Mongolia, the vastness of the area and the extremely difficult conditions of transport and communications, and the fact that Mongolia is now at a harsh winter with temperatures of about 20 degrees below zero, the local police and emergency services have overcome enormous difficulties by mobilizing almost all police and mobilizing local pastoralists, carrying out a wide range of carpet search and rescue operations in the vicinity of their lost positions by riding, walking, visiting pastoralists, etc.
At the same time, in response to the particular situation in the pastoral area, Monfang has been broadcasting news bulletins on radio for many days.
The country's Blue Sky rescue team has also been actively involved with Mong.
The safety and security of the two missing persons has always touched our hearts.
It has been more than 10 days since the two men lost contact, the Embassy has received some leads, but they have not been found, and the search and rescue operation is still under stress.
The Embassy will remain focused on the "people-centred" principle and will promote the continued and full search and rescue efforts and the provision of maximum assistance to the families of the individuals concerned.
The Embassy calls for contact with the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia at the first time, if any, in Monk and in the business.
