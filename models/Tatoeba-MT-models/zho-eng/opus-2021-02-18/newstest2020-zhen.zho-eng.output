The release of the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report on 26 June states that Iran has begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the nuclear agreement reached with the world ' s major Powers in 2015.
Comprehensive media reports that the IAEA report states that the advanced centrifuges at the Natanz Nuclear Facility in Iran are either accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium " .
Since the withdrawal of United States President Tripp from the nuclear agreement last May and the imposition of sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the nuclear agreement reached with the major Powers in 2015.
According to the agreement, Iran can only use the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges to refine uranium.
The other signatories of the agreement, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to save the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to the Japan Commons, in the afternoon of 25 local time, Foreign Minister Mao Moi-tung met with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, United States of America, where he visited, confirming that he would move forward with the negotiation of a peace treaty covering the territories of the four northern islands (the disputed islands of Japan and Russia, called the " North Four Islands " , the Russian Federation, the " South thousand Islands " ) and the development of relations between the two countries in a wide range of areas, including politics and the economy.
This was the first consultation with Russia since Shigeki took over as Foreign Minister, as the head of the negotiations for the conclusion of a peace treaty.
Shigeki stated to the Russian side that " [t]he interest in effective consultations, including the promotion of common economic activities (on the four northern islands) " .
According to the Government of Japan, the talks did not discuss the territorial issue in detail.
At the December 2018 Russian-Russian summit meeting, the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, in their capacity as heads of State, confirmed their approach to accelerating negotiations.
At this meeting, the Foreign Ministers of the two countries welcomed the progress made in consultations on joint economic activities in the areas of tourism, garbage disposal and waste disposal.
Shigeki looked forward to the pilot tour operation scheduled for October: " Wishing to be successfully implemented, leading to the next step ... "

According to the main Tongan media, Matangi website, the Tongan Parliament is unicameral and consists of 26 members.
In the parliamentary vote of the same day, Tuionetoa won 23 votes to defeat the competitor's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure and Tourism, Semisi Sika, and was successfully elected.

Tuyonetoa still has to accept the king's appointment.
The next parliamentary elections in Tonga will be held in 2021.
The women's platoon is expected to defend the World Cup in advance!
On the 27th, in the match for Dutch women, the Chinese team was pulled back to the city with two win-wins and finally won nine by 3:1 nicks.
The World Cup is nearing its final stage, and while the crown is at stake, the Chinese women still face the Serbian line.
In the first two games with the Netherlands, the Chinese women's platoon was as strong as it had been in the past, going down two towns at 25:19, 25:16, until the third.
The Dutch women's ranks have increased their aggressiveness in the background of backwardness, and the Chinese team has been hit, and the girls' attacks have begun to increase, and they have been driven back to a city at 21:25 by their opponents.
In an interview, Rohei-san also said: " In the third round, we sent about eight points because of a mistake. "
Of course, the Dutch women would have been better off, and the Chinese women were ready to lose one game, but Rongping was still in control. " It's normal to win and win with a strong team, and it's normal to play five games, so we said to focus on the team, " Rongping said so.
In the fourth round, the team actively adjusted, Zhang Zhang opened fire on the attack and received eight points in the single game to win the team.
So far, there are only two rounds left in the 11 rounds of confrontation, and the Chinese women's platoon, although one hand has touched the champion's trophy, did ring a wake-up call for the Chinese women in the Dutch team: the more critical it is, the more it is.
In another race on the 27th, Russian and American women were in five games, and the United States team failed to get three points from their rivals, so that Chinese women would be able to achieve their coronals in a round ahead of schedule if they were to score three points in the match against Serbia.
Things are moving towards a favourable position for Chinese women.
However, the fact that Serbia's six main players are in short supply does not mean that they will give three points easily to the Chinese team.
In the current form of the scoreboard, the Serbian team is largely incompetent, which means that they can "go in light" in the competition against Chinese women, drop the burden and hit their opponents with their full force, while the Chinese team is under a crowning pressure and their state is likely to rise and fall.
In addition, the replacement of the Serbian team was not the lamb of the "inherited" before the battle with the Dutch team, where the two sides fought in five games and Serbia team two eventually reversed the whole Dutch front at 3:2, thus demonstrating the depth of the formation.
Before the third phase of the competition, Rangping also said that neither team would be able to handle it: " The game in Osaka will be very difficult, and we will still have to prepare carefully, as always ... "
Now that the horn of the coronation has sounded, the competition has really reached the stage of "hotning."
As far as power is concerned, the Chinese women are above their rivals, but only at the last minute, and to see if the girls are able to play their normal level and release themselves in the arena.

Stoltenberg, speaking at the West Point military academy in the United States, said: " For 70 years, NATO has taken containment and defensive measures based on the preservation of technological advantages ... "
He said, but the times are changing.
Stoltenberg says, " We're experiencing a growing competition...
It is therefore time to redouble our efforts in order to be sure that there will be no more than us ... "
He said: " Some new technologies are not developed by NATO member States, but in authoritarian countries ...
Chinese companies are working on the 5G network.
Russia has developed an independent Internet and invested heavily in the development of future generations of weapons, such as high ultrasound missiles ... "
Stoltenberg said that NATO ' s future security " depends on understanding, the ability to accept and apply state-of-the-art technology " .
On September 24th, "A boat ticket took me to see "The Heart Helping Handicapped Event took place at the top of the Long Sands, and more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to the Orange Star ship to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the New China.
Most of the more than 100 disabled people who took part in the event were first on a cruise ship.
Fifty-six-year-old Zhao Jin-gang is a crippled man, who rarely goes out because he can't move his feet.
He said, " Today, for the first time on a cruise ship, it's very exciting to see the splendor of the Yangtze River at close range, and to feel the pulse of long sand. ... "
Volunteers from the social workers' service centre and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha City have provided nuanced services to the disabled.
Especially for people with severe physical handicaps, volunteers go on and off the cruise ship behind their backs.
The Director-General of the Social Services Centre for Social Welfare stated that, over the past 70 years, with the support of the Party and the Government, the cause of persons with disabilities in Changsha City has continued to evolve, and that a growing number of persons with disabilities have become genuine participants in socio-economic development, contributors and beneficiaries, care for and support for persons with disabilities, and care for the cause of persons with disabilities has become a consensus of society as a whole.
The Republic is about to celebrate its seventieth anniversary, and the spotlights of the media on every street have flashed so many images that we don't remember at all — they are the ones who bring heat and light to our bright days, silk and silk...
However, a hero who walks around seems to be as ordinary as you are to me.
Yuan Yong Ping, a deep-seated rice researcher, has bred a good breed, leaving hundreds of millions of people in the world free from hunger and loss of credit, as well as an old farmer who likes to grow up in the fields; Nan In-dong, a leading scientist who thinks so much about getting China's eyes open, a man who spends his whole life, a pot, doing only one thing in his whole life, eating a cold coyotes in the mountains of Guizhou, and an old Han in his castle; Zhou Chang, a red scientist, a very late village boy, who still looks like a Zhijiko, and learns all over the West, with a white hair on his head, says that he's at school and likes a big laugh; and Qinya, a film artist who spends half a day, is after ninety years, and is willing to play an old maid in the cat's name for six or seven hours every day in the highlands.
They, who seek kindness, live in peace, are simple and dedicated, and they are easily able to live up to their own treasures, without regard for their name, wealth or glory.
It's like the story of the Shaolin temple's monk, who's in the middle of the world, who doesn't brag, who doesn't want to be sad.
Every "sweeper" and every naked man's heart, behind his back, has a kingdom other than mine.
It's not just on the shoulders of heroes, it's in the hands of hundreds of millions of people.
Once upon a time, a girl in high school was mad at her friends, " When a hero passes by, someone sits and applauds... and I don't want to be a hero, and I want to be the one who sits and applauds. "
Actually, there's no contradiction between being a hero and applauding a hero.
People who applaud by the road are also passing heat and light, and they're also glowing.
Like me, there are opportunities in life, moments, months and days, and heroes.
Shanghai's best judge, Zou Beihua, who is responsible for the reform of the judiciary, sends the messenger teacher to tell his story at the annual conference, receiving and sending numerous newspaper letters throughout the year, "doing the simple thing is not simple," and Zou Beihua's judges will give a round of applause to this old "sweeping monk".
It's a relationship between heroes, a hero applauds another hero.
There are Shaolin temples, Yuan Longping has vast rice experimental fields, Nan Indong has "the sky's eyes", Qin Jie has a stage and Zhou Chang has a platform... to be a hero, not just to work on his own, but to have a good environment and a positive incentive.
Like the Chinese Eye, it's a myth now.
In the 1990s, Chinese science and technology were still struggling to climb the hill, and the novelist Liu Tsei-hyun has yet to write "The Three Bodys".
The greatest eye at that time was the single-calibre radio telescope in the Puerto Rican valley of the United States -- Arecibo, 350 meters in diameter, considered the world's most invincible.
The Chinese radio telescope was less than one tenth in diameter.
But Nan Indong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insisted on returning home with an almost insane idea: building a new generation of radio telescopes in China, receiving more messages from outer space!
China's a waste of time, so it's a big investment to play with stars?
The Fatherland trusts Nan Indong, and the Eye of the sky is the beginning of a great project.
It's been 12 years since the site was set and another 9 years since it was made.
The 500-metre sky's eye is open, and China has done it without precedent, "The world's unique scientific engineering."
So, "The Eye of the sky" is great, the Nan Indongs are great, they have a big face, and they have a great view of the Republic.
With the trust of the nation, the goodwill of its citizens, Nan Indong's destiny became the soul of the nation's soul.
A country with young talent, a white-haired hero who walks through it, a country where people applaud softly on the side of the road, a country that is beautiful and harmonious.
Waste classification education starts at Jilin Kindergarten, and the idea of environmental protection starts with dolls.
On 27 July, a kindergarten in Jilin City, Jilin Province, conducted an educational course on the classification of garbage, teaching young children to identify recyclable waste and other types of waste.
It is known that this is the first time that garbage is classified into local early childhood classes.
The nine departments of Jilin Province jointly launched the "Work Programme for the Advancement of Local Urban Waste Classification" in Jilin Province.
In 2019, on the basis of the piloting of the compulsory classification of waste from living in Changchun City, the province decided to introduce the classification of waste from living in local cities.
The city of Gillin is one of them.
Through this event, we hope to achieve the results of the early childhood-led family, kindergarten-led society and the promotion of the concept of environmental protection.
The event was organized by Liu Li Xin, Executive Director of the Hifang International Kindergarten.
On the same day, the headmaster read an environmental initiative, hoping that the garbage would start with the kids.
Kids group up to do a garbage sorting game after the low-carbon babe dance.
The tutor also issued the "Recoverable" label, suggesting that the kids go home and stick it to the trash can and make a little video.
Liu Lijun described the kindergarten as promoting the concept of low carbon, green environment and regular environmental discussion halls.
There's also a sorted trash can at the dump in the garden, and it shows the type of drop.
The teacher taught the kids what to do with recyclable garbage, geese.
According to preliminary statistics, approximately 5.4652 million tons of municipal waste was generated in 2018 in Jilin province, all of which were placed in disposal sites.
Of these, 3,29.29 million tons were disposed of in sanitary landfills, 2,09.23 million tons were burned and 80.1 million tons were treated using integrated processes.
After many years of effort, all municipalities and counties in the province have the capacity to treat household waste harmlessly.
In the work programme on the classification of waste for local living in Jilin province, which has been published, there is a clear requirement for the further integration of garbage into schools, educational materials, classes, etc., and the enhancement of interaction between students and parents through the creation of garbage classification songs, songs, comics, micro-videos, etc., to achieve the effect of educating a child, affecting a family, mobilizing a community and nurturing a new generation of people.
According to data released by Maada on September 27th, the global sales volume in August was 110,7015.
Sales in China fell by 21 per cent as a result of, inter alia, the under-investment of new cars and the reduction of prices.
In Japan, domestic sales fell by 6%, and there was limited demand for the last bus before the consumer tax hike in October.
In August, Maurada sold 17,729 in China.
August 2018 was 13% lower than the previous year, and sales continued to decline.
China's exclusive SUV "CX-4" sales decreased by 14%.
CX-4 has been on the market for a long time since 2016, and the effect of the new car has declined.
Declining prices as a result of strategies to increase brand value from a long-term perspective is also known to have a significant impact on sales.
Maada's sales in the U.S. increased by 7%, reaching 27482, 14 months.
In August, the sellers had one more day of business than in the previous year, plus "sold promotions like publicity" (Mavda), which had led to an increase in sales from SUV "CX-5".
In Japan, sales dropped by 6% to 1442.
According to the company, the pre-tax emergency buy-out was not as high as it was in the previous (2014).
Small car "Demio" and so on.
Herake is dead, and the political legacy is alive.
On the 26th of local time, former French President Chirac died and was 86 years old.
At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of great change, the political legacy of the French statesman who came to power in that year is still worthy of our praise.
Chirac has been President of France for 12 years in a very charming manner.
He inherited the diplomatic spirit of De Gaulle independence and firm support for European integration and represented the pursuit of the European Dream.
At the same time, he was a strategic statesman advocating multipolarity and multilateralism in the world.
That's why the French media judge him as an outstanding representative of France on the world stage.
One of the exciting political decisions of Shirak is to oppose the American-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France stood up to the pressure from the United States and was at the forefront of the war.
A year after the war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increased terrorist activity and make the world even more dangerous.
Then it turned out that Chirac's warning was correct.
The moment of European integration, the growing United States unilateralism, the past, the Hirac's strategic thinking and choices in international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly very revealing.
Chirac is also a French politician who makes the Chinese familiar and friendly.
He was one of the proponents and creators of the Golden Decade of Chinese-French Relations, and since he was first elected President of France in 1995, he has promoted the rapid development of Chinese-French relations with the strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral Chinese-French engagement entered a completely new phase.
During Chirac, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and cooperation between the two countries in various areas, including aviation, nuclear energy and rail transport, made groundbreaking progress.
The Middle-French Year of Culture initiated by Chirac created a completely new pattern of cultural exchange in the history of Central-French culture.
Chirac's love of Chinese culture has been particularly impressive throughout his life.
According to his Chinese diplomats, Chirac can carry Li Bai, Dufut's poems and even judge the history of Chinese copper.
"It's not true that you've been to Egypt, it's not true that you've been to China without looking at the pyramid" — the golden phrase comes from Chirac.
In an interview with Xinhua journalists, Chirac said: " The West has concerns about China ' s political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China ' s economic growth, and China ' s political status at the international level ...
But I myself have faith in China.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, and that its experience is sufficient to help it build ideas and values for harmonious development and to shoulder its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time ... "
I also believe that China's renaissance will bring new creative vitality to the world's culture and enrich it.
The men have gone, but the political legacy and revelation of Chirac left to the world will last forever.
The Seventh China Computer Institute Big Data Academic Conference, 27 on the theme "Mixed Light Valley, Thinking of the Future", opened in Wuhan, with nearly a thousand leading experts and industry leaders in the field of data research focusing on big data hotspot research and reading the technological processes of big data in the age of artificial intelligence.

After seven sessions, aimed at strengthening links and exchanges between national and international scholars working in the field of big data, promoting multidisciplinary cross-fertilization and the development of the big data industry, the CCS Big Data Academic Conference, which focused on the exchange of scientific results and was the most influential in the country, was expanded to cover basic theory and technology applications.
The Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region co-sponsored the bill against the United States of America.
In a joint statement issued on 27 March by the formed legislature of the HKSAR, the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States Congress expressed their strong opposition to the passing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019.
This statement, co-sponsored by 40 formed parliamentarians, states that Hong Kong currently enjoys the rights conferred by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including the preservation of the status of free trade ports and separate customs zones, the conclusion and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements in various fields, such as the economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports, in the name of "Hong Kong, China".
These rights are not exercised by any foreign government or legislature ...
Hong Kong ' s strict adherence to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, and its involvement in many areas of cooperation with different countries and regions have been remarkable.
The statement stated that the adoption of the relevant bill by the Foreign Committees of the House of Representatives of the United States was not necessary, but merely as a means of brazen interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs and seeking political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong, as called for by its proxies.
The formed congressmen expressed their deep regret at this move by the United States and strongly rejected it.
The statement states that Hong Kong is an important trading partner and source of the largest trade surplus in the United States.
Hong Kong has a good rule of law, a fair and free business environment and a clean society, making it a good place for American businessmen to conduct business.
If the United States were to pass the bill, it would make relations between China and the United States worse, without any benefit or harm, in addition to attacking the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself.
The statement states that Hong Kong will, as always, continue to apply the "one country, two systems" approach, continue to enjoy its rights under the Basic Law and effectively fulfil its obligations.
In the past, now and in the future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international trade and commerce.
According to the 26th European Times, the reform of immigration policy will be discussed next week in both houses of the French Parliament.
French President Marlon has recently declared that France cannot "host" everyone, but at the same time it is trying to "take it well."
According to the report, Marklon is trying to find a compromise route on immigration matters to ease the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview with the General Assembly during its general debate in New York, the United States of America, Marlon expressed the hope that there would be a true "two-pronged" approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Marlon said: " If France wishes to receive (immigrants) properly, it will not be able to accept all " .
Marlon cited four priorities of his immigration policy: to grant asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; to promote the integration of migrants more efficiently; to receive and protect all immigrants entering French territory; and to resettle more efficiently those who have entered France illegally and are not fit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Aid (AME) system is the subject of much discussion in the past.
Marklon said he wanted to be able to "assess" the system, but not to eliminate it, but to limit it.
Following that statement, the far-right leader of the National League, Le Pen, wrote that Marklon's statement was "no talk" .
Right-wing Republican party members and Senate President Rachel also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "determinate" but "realistic" manner, indirectly criticizing Marlon.
Senator Varao of the Left Socialist Party believes that France should be "more accepted and better" in the matter of immigration, and criticizes Marlon for playing with the subject.
According to the report, the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act, which has been in place for one year, has led to divisions within the ruling party, but at the same time has not been able to appease the right-wing opposition.
In the next general election in 2022, the topic of immigration policy will again become the focus of the extreme right, and Marklon needs to do something about it, but at the same time risking to provoke the left within the ruling party.
It was reported that immigration policy would be debated in the lower house of the French National Assembly on 30 September and in the Senate on 2 October.
There are indications that Chinese A shares are on the way to the "back-to-back" wave, and that many listed companies have come out to buy back their shares.
According to the East Wealth Statistics of the Financial Data Service, the total value of A-listed companies repurchased in 2019 was more than 100 billion yuan (RMB, the same amount), well above the figures for the same period in previous years, resulting in a record increase in the volume of A-stock repurchases.
In response, Xu Yang, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Information Consulting and Limited Liability Corporation, stated that the lower overall valuation of the A stock market this year and the buy-back of shares at relatively low prices would help the listed company to increase the efficiency of its use of funds, also reflect the willingness of the listed company to proactively manage its market value and its abundant cash flow, and help boost investor confidence.
In addition, the improved stock buy-back system has encouraged listed companies to actively engage in stock buy-backs.
At the beginning of this year, for example, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued rules for the enforcement of repurchases of listed companies, which provide detailed guidelines and guidelines for repurchases of listed companies.
Media statistics also show that since this year, listed companies that have implemented buy-back schemes have concentrated mainly in infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronics manufacturing.
In addition, in terms of repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased over $1 billion this year.
First of all, it's the Ely's share, with a buy-back of over $5 billion.
What are the market implications of repurchases of listed companies?
In an interview with the Chinese news agency, Zhao Zhijun, Vice-President of the School of Finance and Finance of the People ' s University of China, said that the buy-backs showed, on the one hand, that listed companies had a strong economic power and a better financial position, were able to maintain stock price stability and give investors confidence, and, on the other hand, that listed companies and their holding shareholders were responsible to companies, to markets and to investors.
The former is based on good corporate performance, while the latter requires higher quality for listed companies and their controlling shareholders.
For capital markets, these are the core building blocks.
Repurchase of shares by listed companies helps boost investor confidence and supports the stock prices of listed companies.
The Eastern Securities Institute also estimated that, based on the expected stock buy-backs set by A-listed companies as a whole since the beginning of the year, and the average exchange value of the stock buy-backs, the increase in stock buy-backs for the A-stock market this year is expected to exceed $150 billion.
In almost two months, the restoration of the great painting of the Tianjin Palace of Tianjin Palace, which was completed on 26 days, will be reopened during the National Day.
"Sacraments of the Queens" is a large traditional mural that reflects all of Mother's ancestors' lives.
With the approval of the competent authorities of the State, Cai Changqui, director of the Tianjin Folk Museum (the Queen's Palace), was created from 1991 to 1994.
It is known that the mural was painted south of the palace, 32 metres long and 2.6 metres high on the walls of the North Palace, in two parts, with the birth of the Queen, the crossing of the sea and the rise of the plume, and that 358 people recreated the life of their mother.
Cai Chang Gyu explained that in recent years, Tianjin's summers have been rained and winters dry, and this "wet dry" has caused the murals to break up, which in part account for 60% of the total mural area.
In order to protect and save Mom's ancestral murals, the ancient cultural street council and Tianjin City Palace initiated work on the restoration of the palace and the interior murals.
The restoration project was led by Cai Chang Gyu, and the four famous national painters were invited to participate.
The restoration work was based on the principle of "old as old", while the original murals were partially adapted and the original murals were supplemented with the original imperfections.
We've also made innovations and experiments in color, materials, pen ink, etc.
After the restoration, the original mural style, spirituality, spirituality and artistic style were preserved.
The Queen's Palace was built in 1326. It is known as the Queen's Palace, which has been rebuilt many times. It is one of the oldest buildings in Tianjin City and one of the oldest temples in China's present age.
On September 25th, the shipping ceremony took place in Beijing International Airport.
The look of the Beijing Dynasty International Airport terminal is called the "phoenix wing", the head of the seven wonders of the new world.
Currently, Beijing Capital International Airport is overloaded, carrying 100 million passengers last year, becoming the second year of the world's second-year airport after Atlanta.
It is expected that by 2022, 45 million passengers will pass through Beijing International Airport and 20 per cent international flights; by 2025, 72 million will pass through, and the proportion of international flights is expected to reach 30 per cent.
How cool is it as the New Gate?
The Beijing Dae-hyun International Airport, located between the Beijing Dynasty and Hebei provinces, and located at a distance of 46 km from Tiananmen, is the largest newly built airport in the world.
Its roof-covered steel structure has a surface projection of 180,000 square metres, with 25 standard football fields in size.
Beijing Dae-hyun International Airport is the world ' s first terminal with two arrival and two departure floors – F1-F4 international, domestic, domestic, international.
The two-storey bridge that connects the high-speed to the airport outside the terminal corresponds to the terminal building F3, F4 — the international floor and the domestic two floors.
Beijing Da Xing International Airport began the Beijing Double Airport era.
The new airport is located as a large international air hub, and the country is developing a new power source for the integrated regional transport hub in Kyoto, which supports the construction of the new area of Yu An. To date, 66 airlines are interested in entering the Beijing-based Da Xing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 Hong Kong/Australian and foreign airlines, and airline flights have been granted on a continuous basis.
In the winter and spring season of 2019, Beijing Dashing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, 101 domestic and 15 international; covering 112 global, including 97 domestic and 15 international.
This has resulted in a coordinated development with Beijing Capital International Airport, with moderate competition and an international-class competitive double-hub airport pattern, which has eased the pressure on the capital airport to run at a saturated capacity and better met the urgent need for rapid growth in air transport in Beijing and the surrounding areas, and has effectively increased the international competitiveness of our civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Dae-hyun International Airport takes full account of geographical location, the relationship of the airport to the surrounding airspace and operating environment, and the airport runway was set up for the first time in the country, using the world's largest automated air pipeline system and establishing the largest terminal control area in China, maximizing the efficiency of aviation operations.
For the first time, domestic airports of this size have used an automated system of national baggage processing and information management, using innovative baggage transfer modes to improve the efficiency of baggage processing.
Beijing Dynasty International Airport's first flight for the phoenix.
This has created more than 40 international and, first of all, a new airport with a national production rate of more than 98 per cent, which is bound to have a direct and indirect economic impact on the industry in the surrounding region and to breathe life into the economic development of Beijing.
Maverick's provisional November conference is scheduled to be transferred to 16 years of age.
Marawa is tentatively scheduled to hold a central congress in early November to change the age of transfer under the constitution to 16 years.
As Congress passed a lower voting age for the general elections, Marwa announced that the 66th Central Congress would be convened this year to propose changes to the party statutes, including a lower age of entry from the current 18 to 16 years.
Dato' Seri Wei's daughter, President of the Council of Marwa, has indicated that the Central Assembly of the Central Committee was scheduled to be held on 2 and 3 November this year, but that the dates of the Assembly may change as a result of the by-elections of the seats of Tanthuby-Ai.
He said that, since the Election Commission would meet only on 1 October to finalize the nomination date and polling day for the By-elections in the By-elections in the Danyuby-Ai State, they would meet on the following day, 2 October, to discuss whether to change the date of this year's Central Assembly ...
He also explained that the purpose of yesterday's 26th meeting was to finalize the date of the congress and to amend the party's by-laws, but only happened to be on the agenda of the by-election for the country, following the tragic death of Member of the Indigenous Unity Party, Member of Congress Dan Zeuby-Ai.
Zhuang Zhuang, Secretary-General of Shandong Zhuang Zhuang Zhuang Zhuang Zhonghuai
Wang Bao-sheng, born in February 1943, worked in 1967 and served as Secretary of the Commune Party, County Secretary, Mayor, etc.
In 1986, Wang Bok-heung was the secretary of the Su-Gwang County in Shandong Province, where the lifelight was poor.
In his five years of service, Wang Xiaoxiang focused on three things: promoting the industrialization of vegetables; developing the salin beach; and laying the groundwork for industrial roll-overs, which allowed the supplants to raise their pockets and lift their backs.
Lifeless farmers have a tradition and a lesson to learn.
At the beginning of the 1980s, lifeless farmers could not sell their harvests and rot in the ground.
Wang's research has found that the key to catching vegetables is to make a flow.
Lifelight has led to the creation of a wholesale market for vegetables, opening the way for the development of a market economy.
Party cadres have to take the lead. They've screwed up. The county's got to lose everything.
In 1989, 17 winter vegetable sheds were set up by 17 members of the party, including Wang Lo Yi of Zhu Village, with the support of Wang Bao-Chang.
Subsequently, an outreach team was set up in the county, and Wang Lok Yi was mobilized to travel to various townships; in the first year, more than 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted, and then the vegetable huts were pushed to the county and the country.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million acres of land have been painted on shallow beaches, in addition to saline beaches.
It's hard for the locals to live.
Su-nam's got a vegetable shed. What about Su-bei?
Wang Bok-heung organized a rally for hundreds of thousands of people, camped on the desert beach for 40 or 50 days.
Wang Bok-sang and the county's leaders were eating on the construction site, pushing cars and carrying loads, eating and sleeping, and the people saw them stretching out their thumbs and praising them with their eyes open... when Subei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a "poaching pot" on salt beaches.
In July 1986, for the first time, Wang Baixiang participated as the county secretary in the industrial conference of the city of Changjiao.
In the course of the conference, a comparison of industrial economics figures in the 12 districts of the city was published. At first glance, the industrial output was good, lifelight was good, fourth place.
But if the salt is removed, the pure industrial value of the birthday light is only $119 million, in third place.
Wang Jian, with 70 men, went off to change his mind.
Less than a year back, the county invested $150 million in 77 projects.
Every year since then, we've organized a "take-all" mission to Shenzhen, East China and Shanghai.
Lifeless businesses, less entrepreneurs.
Wang Bok-heung held a panel meeting: in the public selection of the director of the factory in the county, 40 "advanced men" emerged and were pushed to the industrial front.
In 1991, Sunlight entered the ranks of the country's hundred most powerful counties, and Wang's deputy mayor was transferred.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4854 businesses, over 100,000 "million dollars" for popularly recognized cadres, who continue to call him "Our Secretary of Peace."
On 26 September, local time, Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, presided over the Foreign Ministers of China and the African States Members of the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Foreign Minister Tanoh of Côte d ' Ivoire, current African Council member, Foreign Minister Oyono of Equatorial Guinea, Foreign Minister Pandor of South Africa and Foreign Minister Carla of Niger, as well as Foreign Minister Jesinawi of Tunisia, present.
Wang Yi made four recommendations on strengthening cooperation between the Central African parties in the Security Council.
First, to unite our strength.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, the direct consequence of which is that the basic norms of international relations are challenged and the role of the United Nations is affected to the detriment of the interests of a large number of developing countries, including African countries, as well as small and medium-sized countries.
To meet this challenge, we need Central Africa to stand hand in hand and shoulder to be able to unite.
In the Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, and the focus is not just three votes, but the continent as a whole.
China and Africa stand together, not just four votes, but will lead other countries to follow, influence and shape the Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, which should be fully utilized.
Second, we'll settle the dispute by negotiation.
China has always advocated a political solution to the hotspot problem, and Africa has a good tradition of consultation and experience of successful good offices by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex challenges on the Council's agenda, particularly the hotspots in Africa, are mostly the root causes of colonialism and in some cases directly related to external factors.
We're going to use Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations together and the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation, etc.
Third, self-empowerment.
African countries and peoples know their problems best, and Africa has the capacity and wisdom to solve its problems.
The Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa when dealing with hot spots in Africa, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen its coordination with non-governmental organizations and to firmly promote capacity-building for African-owned peace operations.
Fourth, it's about development.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we insist on putting economic and social development first and supporting each other in their chosen development path.
China would like to align the process of building the "across the road " with the African Union ' s Agenda 2063, the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries build their capacity for development and address the root causes of conflict.
Together, we want to push the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa's development.
China has provided and will continue to do its utmost to assist the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the resurgence of the Ebola outbreak, and is ready to coordinate its efforts with African countries to mobilize the United Nations, WHO and others to enhance their assistance in order to fulfil the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Neonatals and relays save small lives.
Surprise!
Mother had an early pregnancy, and on her way to the hospital in a panic, a 32-week premature baby was born on Dad's car driver.
Fortunately, the obstetrician and neonatal surgeon took care of it in a timely manner, and the relays saved this little life.
By chance, on the 19th, 20th and 21st, the maternity and neonatal departments of Hubei Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital received three premature births on the road for three days, and the other two were born on 120 first aid trucks, all 29 weeks premature.
Ms. Cheng was a second-born pregnant mother, and at 7 a.m. on September 19th, she felt a little tummy pain, thought she was 32 weeks pregnant and that the first one was premature, and she packed the items she had to give birth and was ready to take a shower and go straight to the hospital.
At 9:30, Ms. Cheng packed up and told her husband to drive from Seo-dong's house to the hospital.
I didn't expect the baby to be born in Dad's car co-pilot soon after the car left.
In 20 minutes, Ms. Cheng and the baby finally arrived at the maternity and obstetrics building at the Hubei Health Hospital.
Hospital security saw the husband and wife and the baby, and immediately informed the maternity ward that the deputy doctor Zhang Jian and the midwife Yoo Ying were going downstairs with their bags and their cords.
" At the time, the mother was lying on the side of the car, under the water of sheep and blood, with a baby boy standing next to her, with an umbilical cord... "
Zhang Chai asked to know that the baby was a 32-week premature, that parents on their way didn't have time to cover the package, that early autumn morning was cold, that he was cold, that he had no cry, and that his limbs were numb.
Yoo Ying went to the co-pilot to process the baby's umbilical cord, Zhang Jing went in from the cab, quickly opened the delivery bag, wrapped the baby several layers of heat with the therapeutic towels and the handbags inside, and cleaned the newborns' respiratory tracts (e.g. graphs), then carried the baby up to the Newborn Section on the 12th floor.
As soon as the Neonatal Medical Services got the news, they went to the nurse's station to rescue the pre-natal baby.
When the baby had a purple skin and was suffocated with oxygen, the doctor immediately inducted him with a trachea, less than a minute later, the baby's heart beats back and the skin colours gradually recovered red and recovered.
After admission, this 32-week-old baby was placed in a respirator, continuously rescued, breathing calmly and successfully withdrawn the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby's vital signs are stable and breathing well, and it's starting to breastfeed a little.
By chance, on the 19th, 20th, 21st, three days in a row, three premature births were attended by the obstetrics and newborns department of the hospital, and the other two were born in 120 ambulances, all 29 weeks of premature births, and are now actively treated in the neonatal unit.
According to Sun Guoqiang, Director of Obstetrics at the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care Institute, in recent years, women and children in the province have received many babies born on subways and private cars, a situation that may threaten the lives of mothers and children.
Director Sun reminds pregnant mothers to come to the hospital as soon as they have abdominal abdominal pain, water, red, etc.
In the event that the mother gets laid at home or on the road, she should be able to sleep as flatly as possible, with blankets on her hip, etc., to prevent the baby from coming out and hitting her head on the ground, and the child should be warmed up immediately and brought to a doctor as soon as possible.

Reporters were informed on 27th of the city launch series of "The New China War Games" organized by the Wuhan City Press Office that since this year, the city has accelerated the transformation of industrial intelligence and has implemented a transition subsidy of up to $20 million.
To date, more than 800 industrial enterprises of more than size have collected information on the need for smart transformation.
Mr. Zhang Hong, Deputy Director of the Department of Economics and Information Technology of Wuhan City, since this year Wuhan has launched a plan of action for the intellectual transformation of industrial enterprises to provide free consulting and diagnostic services and solutions for industrial enterprises above the scale of demand, and to promote a new cycle of technological upgrading of high-level enterprises.
It is planned that the city of Wuhan will select a number of specialized diagnostic services on an annual basis and will conduct a survey of the need for intellectual adaptation for all industrial enterprises of all sizes and above in the form of special columns, questionnaires, and door-to-door filings.
To date, information has been collected on the intellectual adaptation needs of more than 800 regulated industrial enterprises, accounting for almost one third of the total number of industrial enterprises over the city.
Five city-level diagnostic platforms have organized teams to be based in enterprises to conduct "one-on-one" site assessments and programme validation.
Zhang Hong, the city is currently organizing 373 smart transformation projects, with a total planned investment of $29.76 billion, the first 5G smart production line in Rainbow Cable, the national lead on smartphone production in Motorola, the digital unmanned plant for the Wuhan Siemens transformer, the national first batch of quantitative satellite production lines for space scientists, leading the new veterinary drug smart production line for re-emergence in the world of life, and the subsequent start-up of leading intelligent workshops and smart factories in industries such as the Networked Smart Production Line for Intellectual Households in Europe.
In addition, Wuhan City has increased its financial support for smart transformation projects.
Among them are investment in industrial enterprises that is actually completed, including investment in hardware and equipment, soft investment in research and development, with 8 per cent and up to $20 million in conversion grants.
At the same time, financial institutions such as the Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Zhejiang Han Branch) provide personalized financial services specifically for the intellectual transformation of industrial enterprises and significantly ease the pressure on companies to finance.
Trudo's man-made collapse. Can he be re-elected?
This time tripping Trudo out of the big hole, Trudo dug it up a little bit by himself.
In recent days, the media in Canada have come across a series of old photos of the current Prime Minister Trudo, in which he pretends to be black.
This is considered a clear act of racial discrimination, which is causing a wave in Canada.
Trudo apologized repeatedly to the public after what happened.
However, Canadians don't buy much.
Trudo kind of threw a rock at his feet.
As political commentators, Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-black-faced movement" in the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party have been high-profile in accusing opposition parties or dissidents within their party of "losses" in this regard, and have repeatedly threatened "that whoever makes this mistake should be summarily dismissed".
In short, it was Trudo who dug up the big hole that tripped Trudo out of his head.
Trudo was the son of the former Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Trudo, young and handsome, when he first got out of town, he had a whirlwind of the political idol.
He was a political prodigy, and after taking over as the head of the FLP, he fought unexpectedly in the Canadian federal legislative elections of 2015 — the FLP held half the seats in the lower house of the Federation and gained valuable separate cabinet powers.
At the same time, Trudo has put forward a number of deafening political platforms with ideas such as "ethnicity and gender equality" "ecological conservation" "economic revitalization" and an emphasis on the eradication of corruption and "irregular wind" etc.
For five years in power, however, he has been " walking down the road " in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.
On the issue of ethnicity and gender equality, apart from the "blackface" incident, he had previously "probably failed" on a series of issues relating to indigenous peoples, which had led to the movement of protest tents by indigenous groups, chiefs, on the 150th anniversary of Canada's nationhood, to the entrance to the Hills of Congress.
In the fight against corruption, early last year, Trudo was caught up in a burgeoning "Rangeing" incident.
He was exposed to major frauds by his home construction engineering company, Rang Wanling, and pressured the department and officials in charge of the investigation to " lift up their hands " .
Moreover, Trudo, after what happened, became angry with the officials who disclosed the malpractices — Wang Chongdi, who was the first to disclose the malpractices, who was the Attorney General of Canada at the time of the case.
Although the case itself is questionable, its suspicion is difficult to clear.
Many observers have pointed out that the collapse of Trudo's five years in power was due mainly to his own "cutter pit" and that the largest pit is no more than the three words of "the tiger's tail, "the fruit of his own life" and "the lawr, the lawr."
Canadian most authoritative Angus-Red poll data show that since 2015, supporters of Trudo have slipped from over 60 per cent to over 30 per cent, while opponents have skyrocketed from less than 30 per cent to over 60 per cent.
Even though the other opposition parties and their party leaders are equally underperforming, even a significant proportion of the voters who still vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now disconcerting with the federal prime minister, the leader of the ruling party.
On 21 October, when the new federal legislative elections in Canada are about to begin, will Trudo be able to repeat the great victory that he won five years ago?
The answer may be one word: hard.
Whether at the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience or regional aviation integration, Kyoto aspires to develop integration dimensions, they have far-reaching and positive implications.
On September 25, Beijing's Da Xing International Airport officially sailed.
The reporter of the newspaper Shinjing learned from the Beijing Municipal Development Commission that the airport is already oversaturated and that the opening of the airport will enhance the capacity of air services in the capital.
Following Shanghai, Beijing became the second city to have two airports in the same city, mainly serving domestic air services at the Shanghai Rainbow Bridge International Airport, while the Pudong Airport was dominated by international shipping, and the future capital airport and Da Xing Airport will be positioned to serve the differences between domestic and international aviation operations and provide a more disaggregated service.
In terms of business development, it's more beneficial for the airport in the capital.
The capital airport, with 100 million passengers per year in 2018, is among the highest in the country, but still has a significant capacity deficit compared to the rapidly growing business demand, especially with regard to international shipping lines.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passenger tourism, travel, etc., and in line with the increasing opening up of Beijing and the trend towards international connectivity, the International Airport of Da Xing has been positioned as a large international hub airport, with plans to cover 100 million annual passenger throughputs and 4 million tons of mail throughputs in the future.
So, there is no overlap between the two airports, with different customer groups and sufficient market space.
At the economic and financial level, it is clear that the movement of the airport will have a win-win effect, ease the air power strain in Beijing, accelerate the growth of passenger and cargo throughput, and create an incremental cake for the dual nuclear operation of Air Capital.
From a user point of view, with the passage of the airport, it is not necessary to focus all future travel on the airport in the capital, but also to reduce the range of problems associated with the excessive concentration of routes, such as extended pass-through security, slower passenger boarding, indirectly increasing the time spent by aircraft and passengers at the airport, increasing the burden of running the airport, and reducing shipping through the airport in the capital, which in fact improves the travel experience of passengers.
According to the media estimates of the time and cost of travelling to large international airports, if the highway is taken from the South Five Circles to the high speed of the airport, 50 minutes to the high speed of the airport, 40 dollars to the high speed of the gas, and 15 dollars to the high speed of the road; and the road to the rail transport train to the high speed of the airport, based on a distance of 20 kilometres and 30 kilometres, the fare is divided into 10 dollars, 25 dollars and 35 dollars; citizens can also travel from Beijing West to Da Xing Station for more than 20 minutes.
In general, citizens have a wide range of transport options to travel to the airport, and costs and time are within reasonable range.
From the point of view of trends, Da Xing Airport is located at the Kyojin transit hub and is therefore a little further away from the Beijing metropolitan area, but has increased radiation exposure to Hebei, Tianjin and facilitated more travel, which is of great importance for the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, in Hebei, Tianjin passengers will have access to more international air line services provided by Daejing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning at the airport.
In addition to the new airport line in Beijing, which runs directly to the airport, there are several highways connecting the airport to the surrounding area.
It's just like Guangdong, Fushan, and the city's passengers can go to White Cloud Airport in Guangzhou via Guang Buddha, the Guangzhou Highway. Residents of Beijing's surrounding provinces, Yu An Xin District, etc. will also benefit from the Da Xing Airport and receive easy and efficient air services.
As can be seen, the flight of the international airport of Daejing has not only added runways and aircraft, but also has far-reaching implications and positive implications, both at the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience and regional aviation integration, as well as for the long-term layout and development of the shipping industry in Beijing, providing diversification options for the movement of the population, promoting the further improvement of the quality of services in the shipping industry in Beijing, and contributing to the process of integrated development in Beijing and to economic and trade development in the vicinity of the airport of Daejing.
So, with regard to the flight to the airport, we're going to be able to account not only for the individual, but also for the overall development of our economy.

2019 Viet Nam Forum on Economic and Social Issues held in the province of Chengxiang
The Deputy Director of the Economic Committee of the Vietnamese Parliament, Nguyen Dejin, revealed that early this year, economic and social development in Viet Nam showed many new developments and continued to grow.
The Forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, the participants had an in-depth exchange of views and views on four themes, namely, the economic development situation in 2019 and the impact of selected FTAs, some salient issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019, outstanding issues in the socio-cultural context of 2019 and projections and proposals for the economic and social development of Viet Nam in 2020.
There was general agreement that in the first months of 2019, global economic growth slowed and risks and challenges increased.
Trade frictions between major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has concluded that, despite the uncertainty surrounding the global economy, 70 per cent of the global economy ' s economies are at a standstill in growth, Viet Nam ' s economic development has registered many promising achievements, with a smooth macroeconomic performance, effective inflation control and an average increase of 2.64 per cent in the consumer price index in the first half of 2019, the lowest in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, but the increase remained high compared to the same period in 2011-2017.
In predicting trends in Viet Nam ' s economic development from 2019 to 2020, the Deputy Director of the National Centre for Economic and Social Projections of Viet Nam, Dundeon, stated that Viet Nam ' s economy had shown a high growth momentum in 2019 against the backdrop of the turmoil in the world economy.
By 2020, Viet Nam ' s macroeconomics are expected to remain largely stable, the implementation of FTAs will contribute to trade development, economic restructuring, further strengthening of business environment improvements and a decline in Viet Nam ' s external export activities as a result of trade frictions.
There is therefore a need to strengthen early warning mechanisms for monitoring and forecasting, to proactively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, to find opportunities to expand new export markets and to facilitate external exports of commodities such as agricultural and water products.
At the same time, the inflation rate is kept at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of supporting industries and supporting the development of high-tech, organic and ecological agriculture.
The Director of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, Siem Reap, Liu Chi Jie, hosted a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the New China.
Liu Zhijie said that, 70 years after its establishment, China had actively participated in international affairs and contributed more Chinese wisdom and Chinese programmes to improve global economic governance and promote global co-development, making an important contribution to world peace and development and bringing tangible benefits to Cambodia ' s economic development and human well-being.
Liu Zhijie described China's contribution to world economic growth as the second largest economy in the world as more than 30 per cent, in particular the China "One Way Forward" initiative, where cooperation between local provinces and cities of China and Siem Reap and the provinces of the region is deepening.
This year, he said, was the beginning of 61 years of Chinese-Cambodian friendship, with fraternal friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation that would be the driving force of local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siem Reap, Disaiha, highly commends the great achievements of the new China over the past 70 years and congratulates China and Cambodia on their friendly cooperation.
Disaiha looks to both sides to continue to work together to advance Chinese-Cambodian friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continuously improve the living standards of the people.
Disaiha said that Siem Reap Province has made a remarkable deal with China's provinces and cities. To date, it has entered into friendly city relations with 28 provinces and cities of China; the Great Cultural Performing Project "Ugo smile" and "Ugo dynasty", the Siem Reap-Kangxi Agricultural Demonstration Garden, the Siem Reap New International Airport Project, a special training course for Siem Reap government officials, Siem Reap Scholarships for study in China, rural diagnostics, the promotion of the revision of urban roads, the White Impairment Recovery Public Interest Project "Lights" and so on. The Siem Reap people have been the direct beneficiaries of friendly cooperation in Cambodia.
The reception was attended by the Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Ken Wensung, President of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, the Governor of the five prefectures of the prefecture, the Siem Reap Branch of the Cambodian Council of Commerce, volunteer teachers, the Siem Reap Branch of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia, representatives of Chinese-owned enterprises and representatives of the foreign Siem Reap Consortium.
Ten years in the town of Yunming to witness the rise of the digital Chinese cloud, Xinhua Network.
If the 2009 local website forum were used as a starting point, it would have been 10 years since the 2019 Cloud Habitat Congress in Hangzhou, 25-27.
From the concept of a cloud to the practice of a cloud, big data, cloud computing has been one of the core technologies that underpins China's economic development, social management and public services in 10 years.
At the Shintai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Heining, Zhejiang, a new co-worker with Aliyun's artificial intelligence was recently attached to the mass examiner.
It's 24-hour, double the speed of recognition, and the accuracy of the test is stable at over 95%.
According to the head of the company, the "mass inspector" with the camera has focused on over 40,000 defective samples, which, with the cloud computing power behind it, can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages and place defective batteries.
This firm is just a microcosm of the transformation of cloud computing-aided manufacturing today.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the " Guide to the Promotion of Cloud Implementation in Enterprises (2018-2020) " , which aims to achieve, by 2020, a significant increase in cloud awareness and motivation in enterprises and a significant increase in cloud coverage and application depth.
Wang Jian, founder of Aliyun, said that today, the cloud computing at the centre of the data has created a bridge between the data and the digital economy, which is a key element.
At the same time, our cloud computing industry has grown in size over the past 10 years.
The White Paper on Cloud Calculator Development (2019) issued by the China Institute of Information and Communication in July of this year shows that the total market size of China ' s cloud computing in 2018 was 96.28 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2 per cent over 2017.
In addition to being the key technology that underpins industrial transformation, the invisible cloud has unwittingly changed urban management and social life.
This year, at the Cloud Habitat Congress, the city brain, which was visible for three years in a row, is still of interest.
According to Aliyun, the urban brain has now become a hub for urban management from a traffic governance tool, and collaborative applications have been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through cameras, artificial intelligence algorithms, the city's brain, through its powerful computing ability, has been able to achieve the functions of new urban management services, such as parking before paying for a visit, real time perception of the number of visitors, tourism route design.
In the field of government services, it's easy to match "one cloud" with "one thing" and "hand over" with "hand over" and "hand over."
At present, Zhejiang has built a province-wide unified public data platform through the political cloud.
As of 11 September, the platform had covered over 57 million resident people and over 15 million corporate entities in the province, grouped into 3,066 types of 19.8 billion data.
Zhejiang Province Government departments have moved on average every month, with 12 million data shared, and every time data is called on the cloud, it may mean that the crowd is running low.
Makoto makes tea with a plastic bag!
According to Central, a recent study in Canada has found that a bag of plastic tea bags could release billions, or even billions, of plastic particles, significantly higher than a person's estimated total intake of microplastics, but there is no evidence to date that the ingestion of plastic particles could pose a threat to humans.
Researchers at McGill University in Canada have reportedly found that immersing plastic tea in an almost boiled hot water (95°C) would release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This number is significantly higher than a person's estimated total intake of microplastics.
According to studies published earlier in 2019, ordinary people eat at least 50,000 plastic particles a year and inhale the same amount of microplastics.
According to the information received, the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of commercial plastic tea parcels in Monteiro stores and cafés, opened them, immersed the bags in almost boiling water for five minutes and analysed them using electronic microscopes and spectrometers.
According to this study, they found that the single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, " several orders of magnitude higher than the previous plastic load of other foods " .
According to reports, most tea bags are made of natural fibres, but many brands made of natural fibres are still sealed with plastic.
Some of the branded tea bags are no longer paper-made and instead use plastics, which are the subject of testing by researchers.
Plastic particles are small fragments of plastics, defined by researchers as being in the range of 100 nm to 5 cm, produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and the deepest trenches around the world, running water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
For the first time in October 2018, researchers found plastic particles in human excreta samples from several countries in different regions of the globe.
In order to test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from the tea package, the Canadian research team placed daphnia in contaminated water, and found that microplastics affected the behaviour of the daphnia and caused them to develop in a developmental malformation.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that the ingestion of plastic particles could pose a threat to humans.
However, WHO points out that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics are spread to the environment and what impacts they have on humans.
Researchers speculate that the reason why these tea packs release large quantities of plastic particles may be that the plastic bags are in contact with boiling water, and even if the "eating" plastic is heating up to 40°C, they may decomposition or seepage of toxic substances.
According to Guterres, climate emergencies are the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster erodes the human development gains of a generation.
This is illustrated by the hurricanes that have hit Papua, Dominica and the Bahamas since this year.
About a quarter of the people in small island developing States live at 5 metres or lower above sea level.
Evictions may seriously affect their society and way of life and even raise questions of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday ' s Climate Action Summit, small island States committed themselves to achieving carbon neutrality and 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030, thereby again leading the world in the right direction.
Gutierrez said, " The climate crisis is stowing new injustices over old ones.
Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are also caught in a disaster and an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of debt ...
The world must act, and the time has come to make major decisions and to invest heavily in small island developing States ... "
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transition to renewable energy; and urging international institutions to help small island developing States, particularly highly indebted middle-income countries, to access finance.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the Earth's lifeline, the oceans.
The latest special report issued this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered the "heavy consequences" of the climate crisis.
By the middle of the century, many regions could experience some extreme sea level rise that would have occurred only once in a century.
The report warns that, without significant investment in adaptation, some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable.
Contamination, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.
Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is reducing resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small island States also face high transport, energy and infrastructure costs.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets and subject them to price fluctuations.
Efforts are also under way in some countries to address the security impact of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.
Gutierrez said: " By addressing a problem in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere ...
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples to be drawn from around the world. "
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India states that the financial system is fully liquid.
India’s finance minister, Sitaraman, stated on 26th, that the current financial system is fully liquid and that India’s economic growth, driven by the demand for holiday consumption, is expected to recover in the second half of the fiscal year.
This statement was made after a meeting with representatives of Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks, etc.
Thertalman has not explained the relevance of these statements.
Earlier, some Indian and overseas media blamed the continuing slowdown in India’s current economy on the liquidity constraints of non-bank financial institutions.
As an example of the decline in car sales, Seetaraman denies that liquidity constraints are the main cause of the decline in sales.
According to Seetalman, the decline in car sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
The Taraman predicts that India ' s economic growth, driven by holiday consumption, will recover in the second half of the fiscal year.
The annual shopping season in India, starting in September, will continue until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will contribute significantly to economic growth in India.
The Jiangxi Department of Education has recently issued a circular prohibiting all provincial primary and secondary schools from making non-compliance during the National Day break and organizing random unannounced visits.
In the issuance of the Circular on the Prohibition of Retrogression of the National Day, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education stressed that primary and secondary schools in all regions must make a firm commitment during the National Day to ensure that no students are allowed to attend remedial classes or to attend new classes, and that no training courses, special courses, Osai classes, classes of interest, classes of promotion, etc., are held in schools, and schools are rented to other educational institutions.
At the same time, it is prohibited to organize in-service primary and secondary school teachers, to recommend and induce students to participate in remedial classes for in-school and out-of-school violations, to participate in extra-school training institutions for primary and secondary school teachers or by organizations such as other teachers, parents, parents ' committees, etc., and to introduce teachers to out-of-school training institutions and others and provide relevant information.
The circular made it clear that, in the case of identified remedial behaviour in primary and secondary schools, additional points would be deducted from the district education administration ' s high-quality development education appraisal; in the case of teachers involved in remedial behaviour, they would be dealt with seriously in accordance with the relevant provisions of teacher style.
Support for the production of pig production, guarantee of market supply
The loyalty demands that the measures be implemented in six ways.
A provincial teleconference on the promotion of guaranteed market supply for pig production was held today to mobilize and re-deploy the policy measures of the Central and Provincial Councils and the Provincial Government to support guaranteed market supply for pig production.
The loyalty demands that measures be implemented in six areas for the production of raw pigs.
The mayor of the food basket is in charge. This year, the province-wide explicit 45 million-headed pigs have been detached into the municipalities and incorporated into the accountability test.
Take care of the policies and measures and actually solve the "last kilometre" problem.
Catch the production of fertilizers, implement carefully the policy of subsidies for fertilizing hogs, encourage pig farming enterprises to scale up their production, and systematically select excellent hogs from the group of commercial pigs.
We're looking for a firm that's not yet in our province, and we're looking for it as a top priority.
Take care of the market flow system, speed up the construction of the boar chain logistics facility, and contribute to the overall shift from "dipping pig" to "dipping meat".
The modern system of vaccination is being implemented, with basic quarantine personnel commensurate with the size of the farm and the tasks involved, and the first line of prevention and control of the disease is being secured.
Faithful demands to provide full security for the meat market, to ensure that there is no large-scale shortage and widespread disruption of supplies, and to ensure a smooth supply of pork on major holidays.
The meeting also deployed efforts to keep the African swine plague under constant control, to prevent the capture of important waters of my governor's river basin, and to purchase rice in the middle and late hours of the province.
I'm talking about the motherland, the spirit of the nation, the big white rabbit, and the old Shanghai characters, they're taking party classes for college students.
"Me and My Fatherland" school is stuck to make college students happy.
On the occasion of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, Shanghai ' s soap-making, life-changing, white rabbits, it is rare to have four famous Shanghai Technological University ' s art class, 27 days, and four Shanghai 's representatives, with an average history of more than 90 years, to tell more than 200 young students the story of their country, the spirit of the nation.
It's an old brand show on the scene.
In the classroom, the intriguing stories have caused the students to wonder about the product display of the old brand and the "Me and My Fatherland" campus, which makes the college students "unsatisfied."
Big hare plaster, big hare ice cream... as an old brand name, big hare milk has been actively changing in recent years, taking the initiative, insisting on innovation and crossing borders.
Born in 1959, the Great White Rabbit happens to be on his 60th birthday this year.
The world's eyes will be on the youth consumer group.
The Deputy General Manager, Wang Waijie, Secretary of the Party, Shanghai Foods Company, mentioned the scene of "Abalone Eating With the Spring, Summer Inflammation with Bad Fish, Autumn Depressionr Eating Drunk Shrimp, Winter Cloud Drunk Crab" as a reflection of the constant innovation in "Eating".
Companies have also developed brand culture from taste innovations, comic-packaging designs, etc., to adapt to the legacy of younger consumer groups.
The old word represents the path of innovation on the spot in Art class.
So did the manager Yuji, " All innovations are solid foundations, and every innovation in the old code is a thick, thin-haired process " .
Every man's heart hides his expectations of the old word.
A product-centred era of small beauty should begin... "
As one of the first "old Chinese characters" in the country, Shanghai has rapidly adapted to market trends, upgrading brand VI visuals, introducing professional operating teams, and achieving a significant increase in turnover.
"The old characters are not only seen in these traditional channels, such as supermarkets, but now they are also actively involved in new retailing and activities.
All our changes, ultimately, are to achieve the goal of making it accessible to consumers, hearing it, and finally buying it... "
O-Yang Ling, Deputy Managing Director, Shanghai Soaps Ltd., said .
In the future, Shanghai soap-making will also insist on high-end development, system development with a wide range of promising, user-satisfactory, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products, and a high-tech, cost-effective path.
Through this art class, the students have a lot to gain.
I grew up with the old words, which carry the good memories and emotions of my childhood... "
SONG Xien-jin was so impressed.
The old Shanghai characters represent more than 200 young students who tell the story of their country, the spirit of the nation.
Zhou Xiaoting said how to dig up brand culture so that high-quality traditional culture can be inherited from generation to generation is a matter of thought and exploration as a design student.
The party course is based on the "Shanghai Image" project of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts of the Chinese Polytechnic University, Professor Nishang's "old-name integrated brand-innovation studio", which seeks to deepen the cultural potential and modern commercial values of the old-named characters, to build on the competitiveness and influence of the old-named characters in Shanghai, to increase cultural radioactivity in Shanghai, to achieve the industrial effects of "1+1" in the form of "design + culture" and to demonstrate Shanghai culture from a new perspective.
According to the information received, Art class will also continue to invite lecturers in literature history, master painters, masters of pottery, masters of architecture, masters of garden landscapes, by telling them about the innovations and adherence to Chinese culture, highlighting the features of the times, further strengthening the idealistic beliefs of university students, fostering the love of university students, speaking with their works, making their works sound, making innovation party classes popular to students, enhancing the ideological, theoretical and personality of party classes, targeting them, increasing the inflammability of party classes, and building new generations capable of assuming a major function of national renewal!
Abe 3rd video to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the New China.
On the 26th of local time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe via video congratulated the People's Republic of China on its 70th anniversary.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, I am Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the establishment of the People ' s Republic of China, I wish to extend, on behalf of the Government and people of Japan, our warm congratulations.
At the G20 Osaka Summit in June, Japan and China cooperated to make the summit a success and declared the firm will of the G20 to the world through the " G20 Leaders Osaka Summit Declaration " .
In addition, at the Japan-China summit and dinner preceding the summit, it was agreed that President Xi Jinping would undertake a State visit to Japan next spring, with a unanimous determination to usher in a new era in the day.
Japan and China share a great responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
I am convinced that a new model of future relations between the two countries will benefit from the joint efforts of the two countries to address the problems facing the region and the world and to contribute to the international community.
In conclusion, I wish the day for relations to flourish and for the cause of my friends to flourish.
"Some of the overage farm workers on the site are estimated to be more than half.
Now, where do we find young workers?
There's no way to use so many old people on the site. "
In recent days, Zou Zou Zhou Zhou, a long-time construction contractor, has lamented the presence of over-age migrant workers (over retirement age) on the site.
In recent times, the university where the author was working on a rain-contaminated diversion project, there have been a lot of migrant workers on the campus, and if you look carefully, there are a lot of over-age migrant workers.
Overage migrant workers are not "suspensive," but because they "can't" have the "must" of impotence and hardship — whether to save money to solve their own old age and medical problems or to help their children, they drive these old people who were supposed to be "suspensive" to work.
The "old man" of the overage farmer isn't as easy as we thought.
Child-rearing, old-age support, school for children, help children build buildings and buy cars, help children start a family business, raise grandchildren from generation to generation, when these peasant workers have done their "life job " , money bags have been empty and even debts have been incurred, and there is a lack of wealth.
In order not to drag on children, but to save some wealth for themselves, a lot of peasant workers insist on doing it until they can't do it.
Many new generations of "90s" and "00s" farmers are reluctant to work under difficult conditions, labour-intensive secondary industries or low-end services, creating structural "unworkable " jobs, which offer opportunities for over-age farmers.
In the absence of skills, physical and labour capacity has been reduced, and many overage rural workers are engaged in high-intensity, low-income, high-risk and low-security jobs.
A day's work is a day's work, a little bit more, and the survival of the overage migrant worker behind "no time" cannot be ignored or ignored.
Solving the problem of unpaid and paid work, improving labour protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labour income and improving the survival of over-age migrant workers, in addition to their "self-saving " , is equally indispensable to public-sector systems for protecting and caring for human beings.
Some scholars have pointed out that it is no longer possible for over-age migrant workers to rely on home farming to solve their old-age and medical problems, and that they have to provide for their families in other ways.
The inability and strength to read the word "no time" for overage migrant workers helps us to better understand the love and pain of overage migrant workers.
Seeing the shadows of overage migrant workers, hearing their groaning, trying to get them back to the countryside to truly "get old and live " , requiring the public sector, the market and society to share responsibilities in a virtuous interaction, requiring a concerted effort.
Chemezov said that Russia would not export such systems for the next five years, because "first supply its own army, then export production will take place " .
This approach is fully consistent with international practice.
The major producers of weapons and military equipment are always the first to ensure their defence needs before they deal with export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Grihoff, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Sky Force, said that the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by "The Diamond-Antaire" Aerial Defense Concubine.
It's a new generation of anti-aircraft systems that use the working principles to destroy ballistics and aerodynamics targets.
The main role of S-500 is to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles, capable of intercepting missiles with a range of up to 3,500 km.
In addition, according to some information, S-500 can destroy high ultrasound cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of drones, high ultrasound missiles five times faster than the sound speed, even near-space targets.
Such weapons can also form a unified network with other anti-aircraft systems, particularly S-400 systems, which is very important from a national defence point of view.
Sergei Chemezov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said the system was currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian army also needed it, including in the Arctic.
S-400 air defence systems into service in the Arctic Air Defence Corps.
According to information from 15 September, the conversion of S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems by the New Island Arctic Air Defense Corps has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely a process within the plan for the transition to a more advanced defence tool in the strategic direction of the north.
According to the Russian Northern Fleet Information Service: " With the transition to a new S-400 air defence system, the controlled airspace of the Arctic region has increased significantly ... "
It's very important that the military assesses that the system has been used successfully in the far north and the Arctic.
Air force officers trained for the new system and prepared for combat duty.
It was previously equipped with a S-300 long-range air defence system and still has a portion of it.
As far as air defence systems are concerned, they must possess weapons capable of destroying a wide range of aerial targets, be they high-speed targets at an outer altitude or fish that are close to a protected facility.
According to open sources, the S-400 "Trimph" system, developed by the "Gold Diamond-Antaire" Air Defense Concern, was designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high ultrasound targets and other aerial attack weapons.
This weapon can strike aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 kilometres and shoot down ballistic targets flying 4.8 kilometres per second within a distance of 60 kilometres.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional anti-aircraft forces in the far north to ensure the security of airspace on the northern sea lanes.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of Tor-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, sufficient to form an air defence camp to strengthen the Arctic air defence system.
The Russian Ministry of Defense had said at that time that the Arctic Tor force would be expanded to full brigade formations in the future.
These advanced anti-aircraft weapons, together with the new S-400 long-range systems deployed on New Island and the Kola Peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short-range systems deployed in the far north, provide a powerful shield for the Russian polar sky.
The enemy's planes, helicopters and drone missiles will be hard to break this defense.
According to the Russian government, the flagship shop will be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods and avoid the complex and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
As a Russian store operator, the Russian company is focused on selling Russian goods in China.
The largest trading platforms in China, such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduduo, ShuuQ, Multifunctional Instant Communication Software (Wechat), have online stores and own their own online platform, Ependuo.com, and Russian retail stores.
Russian export centres will work with Russia to develop marketing strategies and participation criteria for shops and screen virtual shelf-mounted companies.
The store is scheduled to open before the end of this year and build at least 10 products from Russian manufacturers.
According to information from the Russian Export Centre, the total number of visits per month to Chinese electric power stations is as high as 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, reaching over $1 billion in 2018.
At present, the Ariba Group will also open pilot shops within the framework of the Global Import Strategy for the sale of goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
According to Alexei Kozevnikov, the new store will display the merchandise of enterprises with a sales volume of at least 500 million roubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and 500 million rubles are not good enough.
As we all know, Chinese consumers are very positive about Russian goods and view our goods as high-quality and green products ... "
Kozhevnikov says that competition for highly purchasing power Chinese consumers is intense and growing.
He said: " Our goal is ambitious, with 500 businesses launched through this shop within three years ... "
At the same time, the platform will build the products of Russian firms in the Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor, Trade Policy Fundamentals Unit, Plekhanov University of Economics, Russia, stated: " This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, as Russian export centres are State-owned and not private institutions. "
"I don't see a lot of highly competitive Russian goods on the market... "
He believed that the project would probably not really be implemented, but would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to news from the Russian news agency, the President of the Russian Export Centre, Andrey Slepnev, stated during the Eastern Economic Forum that the product information of more than 170 Russian enterprises had been published on the largest international wholesale platform, Alibaba.com, which could be purchased in China and other countries.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with the Ali Baba Group, namely, the training of experts from the University of Podger for Russian enterprises, whose first seminar was held in July of this year.
The Russian export centre will also be the organizer for Russian enterprises participating in industry exhibitions and commercial projects at the Second China International Import Fair in Shanghai in November this year.
A large exhibition will be held in a 1,000 m2 exhibition hall, which will also serve as a hub for commercial project activities, protocol signing ceremonies, promotion sessions and meetings with Chinese business representatives.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Centre said: " In addition to the agricultural stand, we will certainly hold business meetings, that is, arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs ... "
" This is another direction of our efforts to support businesses and to ensure that dozens of specialized meetings are arranged for them ... "
In addition, there will be a master's class, a cooking competition and a Russian-style food festival for cooking on the "Exploration of Russian foods on the Sea Station" project.

Xinhua Times: Stand firm and stay on our own path.
The White Paper "China and the World for a New Era" released on 27 July answered that China's development had been successful for 70 years because, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people had found the right path to China's socialism and had steadfastly followed it.
It's the choice of history, the choice of the people.
In recent times, in an environment of poverty and internal and external distress, a generation of ingenuity sought help in the search for the country's salvation.
However, " the monarchy, the restoration of the monarchy, the parliamentary system, the multiparty system, the presidential system have all been thought of, tried, and the results have not worked ... "
It was only with the Communist Party of China and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a path of Chinese socialism in practice.
This is the path of happiness for the Chinese people, the path to the revival of the Chinese nation, and the path of China's common development with the rest of the world.
It is on the right path that China will be able to do its job well, become the second largest economy in the world and contribute the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world from its own development.
As the White Paper points out, this path of development in China is in line with China's national circumstances and adapts to the demands of the times, and will show a bright future for development as the times move forward.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people value it more.
The Chinese understand that the South Orange North is not necessarily for themselves, but only for themselves.
It was with this confidence and strategic strength that China created a miracle of world visibility.
"History Finals" has been famous for a long time in the twilight process ahead of humans.
Today, the success of China's specialist socialist path announces the end of the "end of history" , the collapse of the "China crash" , the failure of the "socialism" .
China ' s success has boosted the confidence of the developing countries to become rich and rich. It has broadened the path towards modernization in the developing countries. It has provided experience and lessons for the world ' s countries and peoples who wish to accelerate development while remaining independent, and to follow a path that is appropriate to their national circumstances.
The world is rich and colorful.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose a path of development appropriate to their own circumstances.
Instead of "into" foreign models or "output" China's models, China will firmly remain on its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen its relations with countries in governance and make its due contribution to the common achievement of good governance.
At the Fair Work Commission, it was discovered that a 66-year-old female employee had been fired by text from a boss of the Foodworks supermarket because he preferred to hire an employee from an Asian background, and that the boss ' s practices had been severely criticized as shameful.
The committee said that Ms. Gail Ayton ' s boss, who had worked at Wagga Wagga for more than 20 years, Jianbin Wang, an English-named Eddie, treated her employees " in an extremely unfair manner " and could violate anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the store in 2016 and that he had been "wanted to fire me" because she wasn't Chinese.
In this case, the Vice-Chairman of the Commission, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the Internet and found that "Mr. Wang has previously advertised a number of job advertisements at various Australian Chinese employment forums " .
One of the job requirements listed for these positions says, "Present Asian women," and the other says, "Present Asian employees."
The third post says, "He prefers people abroad."
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by text message in April of this year, later claiming that this was due to her absence from work and the alleged small cash shortage on the cash register ranging from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said that Mr. Wang's reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She's only been absent for one shift in three years, and the "missing amount" amounts to a few Australian dollars.
He said that Ms. Ayton's dismissal was not actually related to her behavior or behaviour.
He said, " It seems to me that the real reason why she should be dismissed, backed by evidence of an advertisement issued by Mr. Wang, is that he prefers to hire staff with an Asian background ...
According to section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, it is unlawful for Mr. Wang ' s conduct to appear to constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of an applicant ... "
Mr. Sams said it would be inappropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton in view of his appalling treatment.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, a casual worker with an hourly salary of $26.
In view of the possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams indicated that he would submit his decisions and documents to the Committee to consider whether Mr. Wang ' s actions should be referred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He said that Mr. Wang had not given Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said, " I believe that an iniquitous and biased procedure should be adopted to dismiss the applicant, Mr. Wang "waiting" the opportunity, which he thought would `prove' that the termination of the applicant ' s employment was justified. "
" He was wrong ... to argue that, when dismissing the applicant, she was treated with complete disregard for any natural justice, and that he was rude and grossly unjust in his perfunctory. "
Mr. Sams said that, although Foodworks was a small business, " it must be said frankly that no decent employer would dismiss an employee in the most unfair and ostensible manner recognized in the present case ... "
He said, " This is shameful and extremely unfair ... "

Six people denied being involved in the sale of fake Makkah paper, and the case was brought before the High Court.
Six men suspected of forgery and sale of our passports, paper and identity cards, including an Assistant Director of the State Register, as well as a top-ranking businessman, were brought before the court on Thursday, and the district judge approved the charges of anti-trafficking in persons and anti-trafficking in migrants and referred them to the High Court for trial.
One of them, who was the defence counsel for the Dauda accused, Le Zhenhua (translation), and Member of Parliament Rael of the Sunset Hole, applied to the judge to withdraw from the case, i.e. to cease to be the defendant ' s representative counsel, and the court was granted permission to do so.
He stated that he himself had been criticized by his political opponents on behalf of the accused and that his party of action had been implicated.
He stressed that he was not afraid of any threats in himself, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to denigrate the Party of Action and the Greek League Government or other leaders of the European Union, and that this decision was taken after careful consideration.
He also stated that there was no conflict of interest between representing the accused and being a member of Parliament, and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the accused and that, to date, the accused, Li Zhenhua, had not been convicted.
The six defendants were charged in court on 12 September this year, facing charges under article 26E of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Trafficking in Migrants Act and under article 466 of the Criminal Code (Forgery of documents), without having been granted leave to stand trial.
On Thursday, two District Judges, Nosaha, and Mazlan, after the presentation of the prosecution and the defence, granted the prosecution ' s application to refer to the High Court the charges relating to the anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking in persons decree involving the six accused; as for the forgery of documents, they will appear in the District Court on 3 October, pending the transfer of documents from the prosecution to the defence.
The first six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Ordinance 2012 (SOSMA) and the judge therefore denied bail.
Go with the motherland - Script by one of the FAPD teams.
Kim Chow, an average troop of 1.83 meters tall, is in the middle of training.
Shining stings, unique olive greens and red shoulder bands together form a beautiful landscape.
The other day, journalists walked into this party and felt the determination of the officers to remain party and people's loyalists and their "honour best" love and pursuit.
"Dreaming a glorious life, writing the legends of the new age... "It's a team song written by the soldiers and soldiers of the troupe -- " Walking with the motherland."
This song is the motto of every member of the team.
Zi Xiaoqin, 1.92 meters tall, stands out in the line.
He has a deeper understanding of honor as the flag-bearer of the former uniformed flag guard.
The honor of a soldier comes from hard training.
Zi Xiaogang, as a flag player, has always had a high standard of training.
He's wearing sandbags, he's got seconds, he's got eyes blindfolded, he's got wind, he's got wind.
There's a picture he's never forgotten in his "flag career."
A flag-raising ceremony, rain pouring down, and none of the tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony left.
The moment the flag rises, Zi Xiao Gwang feels the glory of the five-star red flag on his shoulder.
In 2019, Zi Xiaogang was chosen as the reference soldier.
The benchmark and the flagman have different standards.
Qi Xiaogang describes the progress made by the flag-bearers and the base soldiers, although only 20 steps away, as far as training is concerned.
The reference team is the first in the line, which directly determines the level of alignment of the formation.
After the parade, he kicked his leg repeatedly every day, and practiced a kick.
In the demonstration, he's got the exact scale, the pace, the soldiers and the men.
Almost every soldier in the formation has the same experience as Zhis Xiaogang.
The father of the soldier, Zhu Xudong, was at the military parade on the 50th anniversary of the National Day 20 years ago.
To follow his father's footsteps and become a member of his team, he was frustrated and never discouraged.
He said, " It's an honor for me to be able to walk through Tiananmen Square like my father, to be reviewed by the party and the people, and I'll suffer whatever it takes. "
Into the team honor room, eight big words of the capital's sturdy master are shown in the curtains.
The party's political committee, Wang Hyeon, presented the team's entire team from Beijing — a team with a proud tradition, one of the major tasks of opening the country, national celebrations, security at the National Congress of successive parties, and security in the capital's fight against terrorism — which produced a large number of British model groups and individuals, such as the Flag Guard and the Red Heroes, with more than 50 units and individuals awarded honorary titles by the State Council, the Central Military Commission and the Armed Police.
A reception of foreign experts to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China was attended and addressed by Han Jing
The reception of foreign experts to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the People ' s Republic of China was held in the People ' s Hall on the evening of the 27th, with the presence of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, Deputy Prime Minister Han Zheng of the State Council, who delivered a message.
On behalf of the Chinese Government, and on behalf of President Xi Jinping, and with the support of foreign experts and international friends interested in China ' s reform, opening up and modernization, Han conveys his sincere thanks and greetings.
Han Jing said that since the establishment of the new China, and especially after more than 40 years of reform and opening-up, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has united to lead all the peoples of the country to their thorns, and has managed to emerge from a Chinese-style socialism path, ushering in a great leap from standing up and becoming rich to being strong.
Since the 18th Congress of the Party, the center of the Party, centred on Comrade Xi Jinping, has worked together to advance the "Five Ones" overall layout, coordinated the "four All-round" strategic layout, promoted the historic achievements of the Party and the State, and made historic changes, and the Chinese identity socialism has entered a new era.
The 70-year development achievements of the new China are the result of the tireless efforts of the Chinese people and the hard work of foreign experts.
For 70 years, a large number of foreign experts have come to China and have joined the Chinese people in their modern construction efforts, making indelible contributions that the Chinese people will never forget.

Our railroads dig deep into the main wells.
On September 27, Xinhua’s electricity service (journalist Din Jie-chung) reported that our railroad’s first-largest well – the main well of the Lilongong Tunnel No. 1 of the Dalai (Li) railway – was successfully drilled to the end on the 27th day, with 762.59 metres of depth breaking the country’s deepest record of railway rigs.
In the construction of tunnels, wells can be used to improve tunnel ventilation, improve efficiency and ensure the safety of construction.
The Chief Engineer of the Jibhui Station of the Central Iron Tunnel Department Project said: " The successful excavation of the main well of the Goligong Tunnel No. 1 will help to advance the construction of the underground of the construction well, complete the construction of the squares for later periods, open up multiple working surfaces for guidance and speed up the construction of the entire Tunnel in Gaoligon ... " .
Song Tao described the construction of the heights of the Tunnel No. 1 in Gaoligong Mountain using well drilling techniques, equipped with well rigs, well-drilling rigs, well-drives, overall moving metal templates, FJD-6A umbrella drills, large specialized machinery such as the Central Rolling Rock Recoverer, which formed a mechanized opening system, a scavenger system, a suspension system, a winch lifting system, a mechanized flow line of four-tiers, which resulted in eye-opening, blasting, blasting, installation of templates, full process mechanization of concrete construction, etc., which greatly accelerated the construction progress.
It is understood that the Trans-Sino-Magic railway east, west-rely, is approximately 331 kilometres long and designed at 140 kilometres per hour, which is an important part of the China-Myanmar international rail corridor.
It's 34.538 km long. It's the first railway in the country.
The TV show "Foxhunter" was field-viewed, and then we got a line of detectives.
"Foxhunt" in the series on transnational crime detection has recently taken a live look at Tianjin Airport, where actors such as Wang Kai and Wanggui film important scenes such as escorting economic suspects back to the country, with the support of South China Airlines.
The Fox Hunt team shot this time at the airport the most important scene showing the results of the operation: the Fox Hunt team's pursuit of fugitives, the taking of planes, the signing of arrest warrants and so on.
The crew took pictures of the aprons, customs border controls, cabins, doors, etc., and recreated the difficult and professional journeys of China's dry police and fox-hunting heroes to catch fugitive criminals.
In order to successfully complete the film, the Fox Hunters initiated a series of pre-preparations, which repeatedly confirmed each of the details of the execution and ensured the most real and direct visual effect on the human heart.
According to the news, the show is going to take a lot of pictures abroad.
Viet Nam needs to grasp the opportunities for artificial intelligence development.
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities at the level of preparation for the AI wave include prospects, realization of capabilities, asset base and direction of development.
Singapore is ranked first, followed by the cities of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
In response to the interview with the journalist, the expert from Oliver Wyman said: " I find it very meaningful to look back and assess the cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam ...
On the whole, I think the future of Viet Nam is bright in the context of high growth rates, strong economic development paths and a rapidly growing human resource base.
I think Viet Nam is on the right path, and it's doing well.
It is important that Viet Nam know how to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to promote more economic development ... "
Artificial intelligence is completely changing people's work, communication and lifestyle.
It brings greater efficiency, but it also poses the threat of exacerbating social, economic and technological inequalities.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, there are only cities in the world that are prepared for the breakthroughs of the age of artificial intelligence.
Gutres said it was a pleasure to celebrate China ' s 70th anniversary together, and he congratulated the Chinese Government and people on their impressive achievements over the past 70 years.
Gutierrez said, " Every time I visit China, I'm shocked by the speed with which it changes and advances.
You have created one of the most dynamic economies in the world and helped more than 850 million people out of poverty — the greatest poverty-reducing achievement in history. "
He stated that China had witnessed transformative results in the vision of achieving the Millennium Development Goals: reduced infant and maternal mortality, improved nutrition, reduced stunted population, and halved the number of people without access to safe drinking water and sanitation.
At the same time, China has one of the best educational systems in the world, attracting international students from all over the world.
Today, a photo exhibition celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China will open at United Nations Headquarters in New York.

Wang Yi met with Kasera, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malawi
On the 26th of local time, the Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi, met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malawi, Kaserra, during his appearance at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Wang Yi stated that the relations between the two countries had developed in good health and stability over the 12 years of China-Ma ' s union, and that exchanges and cooperation in various fields had progressed steadily.
Last year, President Xi Jinping invited President Mutharika to China to attend the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and the two heads of State met fruitfully to lead China-Ma relations to a new level.
China, together with the Chinese side, is ready to continue to implement the important consensus of the heads of State of the two countries and the outcome of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and to promote practical cooperation between the two countries.
China is ready to work with the Chinese side to strengthen communication and cooperation in international affairs, to safeguard the common interests of the two sides and to safeguard relations between China and the Central African Republic.
According to Kaserra, China is a true friend of Malawi and African countries, and its development benefits the people of Malawi.
Ma is committed to a Chinese policy and thanks China for its support and assistance to Malawi.
Ma is looking forward to the further development of Chinese relations and welcomes more Chinese companies to invest in the country.
About 800 million people travel on national holidays to resonate with China's tourist demand and supply.
About 800 million trips will take place in the upcoming 11th Golden Week!
The large number of tourist platforms shows that there is a boom in the supply and demand of our tourism consumer market.
The national holiday travel report predicts that, based on past national holiday tourism statistics, there will be close to 800 million visitors in the country this year on national holiday, and that more than 7.5 million more trips will take place outside the country.
At present, tourists from more than 500 cities are booking cruises through the platform, travelling freely, custom tourism, local play, etc., involving 100 countries and territories.
According to the Chinese Institute of Tourism, 726 million tourists were received in the country last year during the national holiday, an increase of 9.43 per cent over the previous year.
Not only will the country's holiday be a new one, but the upscaling of consumption will be the main melody of the country's holiday trip.
The trip reported that over $3,000 was spent by tourists across the country during the national holiday, an increase over the same period last year, owing to the fact that tourists generally chose better-exposed products, such as high-rated hotels, no shopping tours, elite groups, specialty cars.
The booking data for Mother Donkey's Tourist Network show a similar trend, with the use of comfortable cars throughout the long line in the country, and the number of "cigarettes" of less than 10 people is more popular than in previous years.
Spring and autumn tourism data show that their consumers prefer experience, service, and differentiated "slow."
The flying pigs data show that our four-line and below-city tourist bookings are growing at the fastest rate of 30 per cent in the same year, reflecting an increase in consumption in more areas of the country.
Personalization is a feature of this year's Gold Week tour.
The travel data show that the purchase order for the car to be rented on the national holiday is expected to increase by nearly 60% over the same year, and that short-distance travel on small circuits around the perimeter continues to be popular; the number of private groups enrolled is up to 155% over the same period.
Sharing joy becomes the main purpose of people's leisure.
Data from the travels show that 28 per cent of the visitors on the Fourth of July were family members, 25 per cent were lovers and 23 per cent were friends of their colleagues.
And in terms of the age of visitors, "after 80" and "after 90" account for more than 50 percent of all visitors.
It is a matter of concern that this year, unlike the past gold journeys, which have been growing more rapidly, the domestic tourism market has been more "attractive " .
According to flying pigs, the number of bookings of the country's travel routes for this year's national holiday has increased by 42 per cent, faster than the rate of departure.
Industry analysis, while demand is strong, promotes tourism supply-side reforms across the country, providing visitors with a much richer "book-breeding dinner" .
For example, the National Sports Directorate, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, has recently issued a joint publication " Golden Week Sports Tourist Lines in 2019 " ; The Shanghai Tourism Festival in 2019 is being held to introduce 7 blocks of 100 cultural and tourist events to attract both Chinese and foreign tourists; and the provinces of Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan and Shandong have introduced price reductions or free measures in view areas.
Data from the travel booking show that the country ' s destinations with unique natural or cultural features are the most "fired " , Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xian, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin will be the most popular city of the country ' s tourist destination.
On October 1st, our first live cinema movie, "Celebrating the 70th Anniversary of New China", will be broadcast simultaneously in 70 cinemas in more than 10 provinces of the country.

China is expected to be the largest beef export market in Australia.
According to an animal protein analyst from the Dutch Cooperative Bank (Rabobank), after the outbreak of the African swine plague, China faced a severe shortage of pork and was expected to become Australia ' s largest export market for beef.
After the outbreak, Chinese consumers are shifting from pork consumption to other animal proteins, which has caused the authorities to destroy many herds. In the past year, China has halved the number of raw pigs and almost doubled the price of pork.
China produces and consumes two thirds of the world's pork.
According to Chenjun Pan, Senior Animal Protein Analyst, Dutch Cooperative Bank, China Region, the demand for other meat, including beef, has increased, with China, the world ' s largest animal protein importer, currently importing 27 per cent of pork and 24 per cent of beef imports.
Ms. Pan said that Chinese imports of beef from Australia had increased by 65 per cent in the first half of the year, and China had surpassed the United States and Japan, making it Australia ' s largest export market for beef.
Yesterday, the Chinese Government indicated that more pork would be released from the emergency reserve before the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party of China.

The world's oldest barber died at 108 years old.
In New York, America, there's one of the world's oldest hairdressers, Anthony Mancinelli, who never retires to cut his customer's hair every day, but Mancinelli died on 19th of his 96-year-old haircut.
According to CNN, Mansionelli emigrated to the United States at the age of eight, helped clean the floors in a barber shop for a little while, and started picking up scissors to serve his guests at the age of 12, thereby reducing the financial pressure on his family.
Mansinelli was in primary school, but he didn't graduate.
Robert Mansionelli's son, Robert, told me that Dad loved work and people from all over the world liked him, but Dad had been diagnosed with cancer in February and was unable to work six weeks before his death because of physical factors, but that was not retirement, because he planned to come back to cut his hair when he was better.
Robert, 82, said he had to find a new barber now after his father's death, because he had to cut his hair for his whole life.
In the course of the year, companies listed on the market repurchased over $100 billion to record-high Xinhua Network.
In order to stabilize the company's stock price and preserve its image, the listed companies began to buy back their shares frequently in the last two years and, through targeted buy-backs, pooled bid transactions, want to send the information that the company's value is undervalued to the market, thereby stabilizing stock prices and enhancing investor confidence.
Eastern Wealth Choice data show that in 2017, publicly listed companies spent $7.9 billion to buy back shares, rising sharply to $51 billion in 2018. Since 2019, the total value of repurchases carried out by A-listed companies has exceeded $100 billion, resulting in a record increase in the volume of A-equity repurchases, and far higher than in previous years.
From the point of view of the purpose of the buy-back, the company's share buy-back appears to be the same as that of the large shareholders, but there are significant differences in the subject matter, the source of funds, the purpose of the buy-back, the equity itself, etc.
In an interview with the daily Securities Journal, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai-based Information Consulting Limited stated that, in November 2018, the " Opinions on Supporting Repurchases of Shares by Listed Companies " had been improved in response to the problems of the current system, such as the narrow scope of stock buy-backs, the complexity of decision-making procedures, and inadequate inventory systems, which had previously encouraged listed companies to repurchase shares, which had led to a significant increase in stock buy-backs in that year.
In January of this year, the official " Rules for the implementation of repurchases by listed companies " were issued, which broadened the sources of finance for repurchases by listed companies, simplified the procedures for implementation, led to improved governance arrangements, and encouraged various listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee equity schemes.
After the opinion was issued, the listed company carried out stock buy-back operations with more applicability, simpler buy-back processes and greater incentive to repurchase shares.
Repurchase of shares in a relatively low position would also help listed companies to increase the efficiency of their use of funds, thereby increasing the level of profits per share, increasing the rate of return on net assets and reducing the pressure on corporate profitability indicators.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is more significant than the increase in the number of large shareholders, and reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their active market value and the abundance of cash flows.
Seo Yang believes that undervalued stock prices are a major factor in the buy-back of listed companies, which are no longer able to reflect the future development prospects of the companies, and that such companies are therefore worthy of investors' attention, but cannot be invested blindly, and require attention to the financial reports and operations of such listed companies.
Listed companies with large-scale buy-backs at least show the firm's confidence and financial strength.
Repurchases by A-listed companies are warming up and normalizing repurchases, with data showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have repurchased shares this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main source of repurchases.
China has recently disclosed the progress of buybacks, stating that the company has cumulatively bought back 5.75 million shares of A shares, or 0.315 per cent of the company ' s total equity, and that the total amount paid is 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction costs), which will be fully used for the employee shareholding scheme, including but not limited to the long-term service plan that has been considered by the general meeting of company shareholders.
Ely has paid $5,792 million for equity buy-backs and has recently adjusted the purpose of the buy-backs, with the planned change from "repurchases will be fully used as a source of equity incentives for later periods" to "cumulative buy-backs of 183 million, of which 152 million will be used to implement equity buy-backs and the remaining 3.049 million will be used to write-offs to reduce registered capital " .
Ely's shares indicate that the cancellation of some of the repurchased shares would contribute to a further increase in the level of returns per share and an effective increase in the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
The TCL Group issued a repurchase announcement on September 25, indicating that the TCL Group had repurchased 359 per cent of its shares at a total cost of $1.65 billion.
The TCL Group Board Office has indicated to the Securities Daily reporter that buyback shares will be used for employee equity schemes, equity incentives, or for the conversion of corporate bonds issued by listed companies that can be converted into shares.
The TCL Group adheres to its established business strategy, constantly improves its competitiveness and sustains its healthy development.
Based on confidence in the company ' s future development and the preservation of investors ' interests, combined with the performance of the company ' s stock in the second market over the past year, and taking into account the company ' s business performance and financial position, the company plans to use its own funds, self-financing and other forms of financing to buy back the company ' s shares.
The former Chief Economist of the Open Source Fund, Yang Drum, stated that the operation of repurchases of shares by listed companies could, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares in circulation in the market and increase the earnings of each share of the listed company, which would be an important benefit to the stock prices of the secondary market; moreover, the willingness of listed companies to take out real silver and real silver and cancel their repurchases from the stock market had greatly boosted market confidence.
Repurchases by domestic listed companies have gradually increased in recent years, particularly performance equity, and boosting investor confidence through stock buy-backs is a very good way to do it, and it is a positive and encouraging practice.
Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Council, Secretary Hu Jinhua of the Changsha City Council, and the four leaders of the army of engineering machines — Jan Jun-sung, Liang Sing root, Ho Qinghua, Liu Fei-heung — set a small target around Chang-shah, from engineering to intelligent manufacturing — three or five years later creating the world's leading industrial cluster of engineering machines.
To build the world's leading industrial cluster of engineering and machinery in Changsha, in the current fashion, it's to build "the strongest surface."
As the capital city of the interior province, Changsha called out this rhetoric. How can it be?
It's based on the power of the hegemon.
The four engineering mechanics who participated in the dialogue, one by one, covered the sky, the ground, the sea, the entire land area: a river-smart light plane, a concrete delivery pump from China and China, a three-and-a-half-hour earth crane, a steel-built tunnel shield, and its "hard power" as a one-size-fits-all man.
Once upon a time, China had little say in the field of engineering machinery.
In time, Chinese companies "involved" into the "Go Out" double-wheel drive, taking the "Way Out" initiative, buying, merging, building, and so forth, and leapfrogging into the global engineering and machinery industry.
Among them, the major economic indicators such as production, market occupancy and sales are well ahead of the same enterprises.
It's the power of the camera.
The Engineering Mechanical Army, "Four Great Kings", is the leader of the Changsha Engineering Mechanical Cluster and the head of the global engineering machinery industry.
In the world industry, who survives and lives well is the hard man to talk.
In earlier years, the global engineering and machinery industry had experienced a cold winter, and many internationally known engineering and machinery manufacturing companies had fallen, but Changsha ' s engineering and machinery manufacturing companies had not only survived, but also strengthened their bodies by using "Cat Winter" as "winter swim", self-pressure, self-break, transformation through industrial structures, transformation from manufacturing to intellectual construction.
It's thanks to the company of the stars to the moon.
The development of niche industries requires both positive enterprise development and active government action.
Changsha's reputation as the capital of engineering machinery is based on bringing together industry-wide chains from upstream to downstream, creating clusters of related industries and improving the business environment, matching services, streamlining the approval process and so forth, enterprise research and development, manufacturing and marketing costs.
It's a good business environment, and it's bringing engineering and machinery to the fore.
History has pushed long sand to the front stage of building a global engineering machine.
The government, the business, and the researcher involved, should take advantage of the opportunities, move on, target and sustain their efforts and contribute to building a powerful nation.
Wang Yi presided over the Foreign Ministers of China and the African States members of the Security Council.
Wang Yi said that China and African countries are good brothers, good partners.
In the past, in the present and in the future, China stands firmly with its African brothers.
Our initiative to hold such a meeting is a concrete step towards implementing the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and the leaders of the African countries at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation last September, in order to strengthen China ' s solidarity with the African countries in the Security Council and to promote better international support for Africa ' s peace and development.
Wang Yi said that Africa is China's most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member, China's vote on the Council has always belonged to a large number of developing countries, including African countries.
In the face of the new situation, China would like to join the African countries in the Security Council in strengthening solidarity and cooperation in the interests of the common good.
The two sides should unite their forces, settle their disputes by negotiation, be strong on their own, and be governed by development.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the participating African States thanked China for its initiative in convening this meeting and congratulated the new China on its 70th anniversary.
The Ministers stated that inter-Chinese relations are based on equality and mutual respect, and that Africa and China have always been the most trusted and trusted partners.
The Non-Aligned Movement appreciates the important and positive role played by China as a permanent member of the Security Council in African affairs, which has contributed significantly to the just and rational resolution of African problems and has made great efforts and contributions to the preservation of African interests and the promotion of peace and security in Africa.
Africa is currently facing the threat of terrorism and extremism, and only by addressing security issues can Africa truly achieve long-term peace and development.
Looks forward to further harmonization of positions with China in the Security Council and strengthening of solidarity and cooperation ...
Wang Yi said there was an important consensus at today's meeting.
We all support multilateralism, strengthen the authority and role of the United Nations, uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and reject unilateralism and bullying; we all agree to strengthen mutual supportive cooperation between Central Africa in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council and to safeguard the common interests of Central Africa and the developing countries in general; we all support African countries in their African approach to African issues and call on the United Nations to provide financial support for African-owned peace operations; we all support the concept of "cooperation for development and development for peace" to help African countries achieve autonomous and sustainable development; and we stand firm in our defence of the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and reject any country that creates obstacles to developing countries and denies them the right to development.
Gansu Qingyang: The lake goats come out of poverty.
In the autumn of September, the yellow-earth plateau will be replete.
The 58-year-old villager Shavili, in the Lewmen's Forbidden Farm Cooperative, fills the herb in the sheep's den with the last straw, sits by it and looks at the white lake sheep chewing on it.
"Eat well, and when autumn and winter are full, the price will be good."
Shavili said he fed the sheep a special diet every day, regularly cleaning, disinfecting, and taking care of things.
Harvey raised sheep for more than 20 years, and it wasn't until he came to work in the cooperative that he knew how thick he used to be.
Shavili is a man of the village of Chai pool in Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His right-hand neighbors are sheep farmers, but they stick to the traditional way of resting. The sheep are of poor quality, and the numbers are small.
In June this year, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative under the guidance of the government, and everything began to change.
Shavili's been working on farming all day, because he's holding on to a little bit of energy.
The people who enter the stock market are the poor, they're the ones who keep the sheep in the cooperative's hands, can't we split the money and sell it at the end of the year?
It's good to have technologists to guide him. He learns how to prevent disease, learns how to feed in science, and becomes the village's small breeder.
The Professional Co-operative for Benevolent Farming is a standardized co-operative with 16 sheep sheds with nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
The head of the cooperative, Zoutao, said there were doors inside and outside the standard sheep shed.
"The wool is thick and easily bred with bacteria, and the lake sheep can't stay in the hot and damp areas, and the sheep sheds must be built in the three-faced ditches, and they must be equipped with wind-resorters to ventilate and heat. "
Zoutao said that, in order to prevent the disease, regular spraying of the sheep shed was required, and three to four vaccination needles were given to the sheep for a quarter.
In addition to living well, the little sheep have to eat a mixture of corn, wheat straw and grass, and have a wide enough range of playgrounds to stretch their bones.
Co-operatives adopt a foster-care approach, which leads local farmers to place good seeded lake sheep here, harmonizes breeding, manages, sells, achieves good seeding, scientificization, standardization and intensive farming.
Today, 140 poor households, divided into sheep, earn more than $6,000 a year, and there are four pro-poor individuals working in cooperatives.
From "Handing the Mountain" to "Fixed Feeding", from "Handing the Land" to "Manutical Insemination", from "Looking the Body, Touching the belly" to "Behind the B" . . . . . . . In Gansu Qingyang, meat and sheep farming is not just a shift in the way of feeding. . . . . . . . . .the "Landhead + Co-operative + Farmer" model has changed the image that used to be "Handing the sheep on the hillside, selling the sheep on the market" . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Zoutao said that if market prices were weak, the local lead firm, Gansu-sun-sung-sung Agricultural Development Ltd., would buy it at a price of $27 per kilogram to protect the market and help farmers spread market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, General Adviser, Gansu China Agricultural and Livestock Development Ltd., said that companies were leading the growing number of poor households to read "the sheep" by providing loans to poor households, sheep farming, order farming, offer purchase, uniform processing and marketing services.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have managed to achieve a steady increase in harvests through farming, breeding, scale farming, slaughtering and marketing.
The city of Qingyang is in the north of the countryside, rich in pastures.
There are currently 913 sheep-scale farms in the city, cooperatives, and more than 5 million meat and goats, as well as 2 1.3 million slaughter-scale processing production lines, and the herds are becoming the pro-poor “head sheep” of the estate.
The French chief of finance said he'd cut taxes by over 10 billion euros next year and called on Germany to follow up.
Reuters Paris, September 26 - Thursday French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said that France would cut taxes by more than Euro10 billion ($10.9 billion) next year, and Germany should keep up with the French fiscal stimulus to revive the depressed economy.
In presenting France's 2020 budget, Lemel states that the ECB's latest monetary easing initiative has created an opportunity for Governments of member States that are able to afford to increase their investment.
On September 12, the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered interest rates to record lows and plans to repurchase debt in order to reduce borrowing costs in the hope of stimulating economic recovery and boosting inflation.
"low interest rates will not allow Europe to prosper again, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient. "
"Germany needs to invest, it needs to do it now, as soon as possible... don't wait until the situation gets worse, " he adds.
He has made this appeal to Germany many times.
France has implemented tax cuts of more than Euro10 billion this year, which have boosted its economic growth.
The global economy has lost its energy, and the German economy, which is dependent on exports, is the first to suffer.
Lemel states that next year the tax burden on French families will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros, including 5 billion euros in income tax relief.
In addition, as the corporate tax rate will gradually be reduced from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over a five-year period, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost 1 billion euros.

Study: The US National Healthy Diet Index has grown slightly, but it is still challenging - the new Chinanet.
On September 27, China Newsnet reported that in recent days, a recent study in the United States has shown that the United States government's healthy diet index has grown modestly over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
But when the score is 100, it's not a celebration.
American nationals still face a "significant challenge" in their diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fang, a nutrition researcher at Tafts University, Massachusetts, stated that Americans still consume too much food that could cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, which are among the most common diseases in the United States.
The study was published in the American Medical Association magazine on 24th.
The study was based on the findings of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the United States Government between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote, " Despite considerable improvement, significant dietary challenges remain " .
These challenges are known to include reducing United States nationals ' consumption of snacks, hot dogs, fat cattle, butter, etc., with saturated fat.
The study found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people ' s daily diet increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, exceeding the recommended intake limit of 10 per cent.
The biggest improvement in American diets is the reduction in sugar intake from 16 per cent to about 14 per cent, but the intake is still too high.
Officially, sugar-added intake should be below 10% in the daily diet.
With regard to the reasons for the decrease in sugar intake, researchers believe it is related to the decrease in people's consumption of sweet soda, but Zhang Fang emphasizes that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yoghurt and ketchup.
There has been a small increase in adult consumption of fruit, nuts, oats and other whole-cough foods in the United States.
However, data for 2016 indicate that the proportion of these foods in the daily diet is still less than 5 per cent.
Despite a slight decrease in salt intake and a reduction in drinking juice leading to low-quality carbohydrates intake, Zhang Fang indicated that they still account for up to 42 per cent of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on biennial personal health surveys that remind adults of the food they have eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have asked the question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's Food Guide for American Residents recommends a healthy diet to reduce the risk of chronic disease.
The guide states that people should consume more nutritious foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, seafood that provides protein, skinny meat, poultry meat, eggs, seed food.
Diabetes almost doubled to over 7 per cent of United States nationals during the research period, and obesity has increased over many years – today about 70 per cent of adults in the United States are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among American nationals.
EU promotion of strategic partnerships with Asia
Member of the Central Political Bureau of the Viet Nam Communist Party, Secretary of the Central Registry and Minister of Economy of the Republic of Tanzania, attended this forum.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the Forum was " European Union-Asia interface: building bridges for the future of sustainable development " .
The forum took place one year after the implementation of the docking strategy in the two continents of the European Union.
The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Junk, stated that the strengthening of connectivity was part of the above-mentioned proposition, as it benefited the peoples and economies concerned.
The above relations help bring stability and prosperity to the parties concerned.
At the same time, he believed that the European Union wanted to send a message about increasing participation and consolidating a mutually beneficial interface between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is a special guest of the Forum and will make an important speech in the plenary.
The country's first stock management subsidiary was set up to run its business with technology.
On 26 June, the first joint-stock bank management subsidiary in the country was officially established in Qingdao by the wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Guang Dynasty and Limited.
According to experts, asset management is an important area in the development of financial science and technology, and the establishment of financial subsidiaries by banks facilitates their use of technology to upgrade their operations.
In April of this year, the Bank of Guang Dynasty and the Bank of Marketing issued separate bulletins stating that the China Bank of Banking Supervision had approved the preparation of a financial subsidiary.
On September 24th, the Grand Bank of Guangcai announced that Gwang Dynasty had been officially authorized to open its business.
Two days later, the Bank of Guangcai led a number of joint-stock banks and took the lead in setting up a capital bank in Qingdao.
Mr. Lee Xiao Peng, Chairman of Gwang Da Group, said that Gwang Da Group would accelerate the pace of innovation by using modern technological thinking and tools, relying on big data, networking, cloud computing, increasing coverage of financial capital, utilization and penetration, increasing client access, happiness and security.
By 2021, we will have built the four pillars of the country ' s development of financial science and technology, further enhancing the capacity of the financial sector to apply it, achieving a deeper integration of finance and technology, coordinating development and significantly increasing the population ' s satisfaction with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Mr. Zhang Xuyang, President of Gwang Dynasty, will use smart investment, smart investment, big data, etc. to help Gwang Dynasty better judge the macroeconomic situation.
New technologies, such as block chains, will also be applied in the future to capture trends and trends from traditional to alternative assets to digital assets.
According to a researcher hired by the National Laboratory of Finance and Development, Dong Hsi-chul, in the face of an entirely new competition in the management sector, financial science and technology companies and regulatory agencies will work together to explore new growth paths with the management of technology.
The Enabling Sector of Finance and Technology is both a need for the transformation of finance and technology itself, and it will inject new life and dynamism into the development of management operations.
At the beginning of this year, Kyoto Digital Technology launched a new management and technology system to improve research and development and control of managed products through technology and digitization.
The new system starts with product design, sales transactions, asset management, risk assessment with four capabilities to upgrade the overall intelligent operation of the management industry.
Experts believe that, while improving client service capabilities and innovations in rich products, ESTs can also enhance risk prevention and improve management efficiency.
Zhang Xuyang indicated that while previous risk preferences to locate clients through questionnaires were prone to deviations, the use of artificial intelligence for user graphics now helped to better locate clients, and the introduction of products based on their investment preferences helped to mitigate risks.
"The electrician, time and space data and other big data can help us better map a region, the dynamism of an industry, the atmosphere... "
Zhang Xuyang said that, while mitigating risks, big data technology would help to improve wind control.
China Railway Tunnel's deepest record has been refreshed.
On September 27th, China Society for Social Security, after more than 1,200 days of day and night work, completed the excavation of the rig No. 1 Tunnel No. 1 of the construction of the Da (Lilongon) railway, reaching 762.59 metres below ground level, breaking the deepest record of the China Railway Tunnel, which was created in a flood.
The 34.5-km-long Grand Ribbon Hill Tunnel is located in Yunnan, and the tunnel is the longest one in Asia with a single-line tunnel across the high Logon Hills in the West Bank.
The tunnel runs through 19 fracture strips and is buried at a maximum depth of 1155 metres, as it covers the possible adverse geological and significant risks of almost all tunnel construction, known as the "geological museum" of the tunnel construction.
The wells are the most important auxiliary tunnel in the High Lignon Tunnel, with the important task of increasing the operational surface to achieve "long and short strokes" and to operate ventilation at the later stages of the railway.
The successful excavation of the 1st well to the bottom of the well marked the official entry of the Tunnel at Mount Gao Ligon into the horizontal tunnel, where four additional operational surfaces could be added to the well, pending the opening and replacement of the underground garage, to speed up the tunnel ' s opening.
"The wells are all in the granite layers, and the depths of the wells are essentially as deep as the water pressure, due to the fact that the granite layers have more cracks and can't stop the water. "
The chief engineer of the Dare Railway Project at the Central Iron Tunnel Bureau told reporters that during the construction of the rig, there had been a number of mudslides and collapses, and that the construction party had invited experts to take the lead on site, and that it had conducted more than 20 discussions on the programme.
" Up to 300 cubic metres per hour and 700 metres deep at the bottom of the well when the water surges in the wells is maximum, with a water pressure equal to 700 metres deep at the sea floor ... "
" If you don ' t pump the drain in time, you'll flood the well 10 metres in an hour, and we'll spend almost 85% of our time on water treatment and 15% of our time digging ... "
In order to overcome the geological difficulties of longitudinal conjunctive development of the 1st shaft, mud surges and water-rich granite, tunnel construction uses a combination of "prospecting, betting, digging" systems to reduce the risk of construction.
Following numerous improvements, the construction of the 1st vertical well has resulted in the development of an open-drilling system, a strangulation system, a suspension system, mechanized water lines such as a winch lift system, which has resulted in eye-opening, blasting, blasting, template installation, concrete-stamping, etc., and accelerated the construction process.
Eventually, after more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the wells successfully completed the excavations at 76.59 m depth.
The railway is 330 km long and is an important part of the international corridor between China and Myanmar and an important transport infrastructure that has been built along the way.
With the construction of the bus, Daikichi's travel time to Riley will be reduced by six hours on the current road to two hours, which will significantly improve transport patterns in the Pheixie region and will facilitate economic and trade cooperation and friendly people-to-people exchanges between China and South-East Asian countries.

When Hong Kong returned to Hong Kong, Hong Kong was close to the mainland, and it made progress and shared the fruits.
It is believed that, in the context of the "one country, two systems" scenario, Hong Kong can continue to take advantage of the "one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, and one country, one country.
She also states that Hong Kong society has been in dispute over the past few months, that every Hong Kong citizen has been affected and that journalists have faced different challenges.
At this critical juncture, it is hoped that the friends of the press will continue to face up to the challenge, to be professional, to be fair to society, to have a balanced press coverage, and to do their part for the future of Hong Kong and to get society back to rational communication dialogue.
KANG Zhong-sung stated that the glorious journey of the new China was also a journey to Hong Kong and its motherland, to progress, to blood, and to honor and honor.
In particular, since Hong Kong's return to Hong Kong, the central government has been steadfast in its "one country, two systems " , the " Hong Kong people govern the other " , the principle of a high degree of self-government. Hong Kong and the Mainland have joined forces to help each other and to help each other. Together, it has created the miracle of win-win and win-win and economic flight.
For this reason, Hong Kong's press is gathered to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
He stated that the past three months had been marked by a series of blatant violations of the law and wanton acts of violence against social stability, which had been fuelled by distorted and false media reports.
He called on the media to promote a climate conducive to popular resistance to violence and to upholding the rule of law.
Professional mediamen must abide by the rules governing the press profession, guide people to their own self-consciousness and violence, and uphold the integrity and integrity of the law.
Some 500 people from all walks of life in Hong Kong, including the press, attended the reception and joined the guest of honor to raise a toast to the People's Republic of China for its 70th anniversary.

The keys to the British tourist car fell into the lake and the whole family was trapped in France for five days.
Recently, a couple in Wales, England, took two children to France on vacation and accidentally dropped the car keys into the lake, and the family was forced to wait five days to get the new keys made by the car manufacturer.
The couple left France with the children.
It was reported that on September 16th, local time, the English family, when they were looking up a lake in France, had their daughter accidentally turned over a bag and fell into the lake with the keys to the car.
But it took them hours to find the key.
And all their belongings and cash are locked in the car.
Although British tourists bought insurance before they left, the insurance company refused to help because the vehicle was not at risk of being stolen.
They had to hire a tow truck to take the car to a garage and reorder the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, British tourists finally got the key to the formula, and the couple left France with the kids.
And their scheduled journey was cancelled because of the loss of car keys.

Pilot notification of commitments in areas such as licensing of the production of low-risk varieties of food products, decentralization of foreign business representation to the FTA
On 27 July, the Shanghai Markets Regulatory Authority signed a memorandum of work with the Government of the Pudong District to introduce 20 market regulatory reform measures, some of which were the first to be piloted throughout the country.
It was explained that notification of a promise means that the administrative authorities, when registering a permit, inform the applicant, in writing, of the conditions and requirements laid down in the laws and regulations once and for all.
Once the applicant has signed the commitment, the administrative authorities can proceed directly with it.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority will support the registration of business names in the Pyodong District and the Shanghai Free Trade Test Zone, the processing of simple processes, licences for the production of low-risk varieties of food products, and the notification of commitments on a pilot basis in three areas, such as partial approval of measuring equipment models, in order to facilitate business access.
Shanghai Food Company, Inc. 27 has been the first enterprise to benefit from the pilot bonus by notifying its commitment to obtain a "food production license " on the spot.
According to the head of the enterprise, food permits can also be obtained on the spot, and in the form of "dismissals", which allows companies to submit part of their material within the time limit agreed upon in the notification of a promise, " the ease of change is felt " .
The Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority has indicated that the implementation of a notice of commitment to food production permits is a national lead pilot.
As a result of the reform, the processing process was reduced from the previous "registration, processing, on-site verification, sample testing, examination of materials, approval certificate "six steps down to "registration, acceptance, approval certificate" and from 20 working days prior to the reform to closure on-the-spot.
Taking into account the high external orientation of the Pudong economy, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority has delegated the registration of foreign (regional) enterprise permanent missions to the Shanghai Free Trade Zone to facilitate the close proximity of enterprises.
Statistics show that the decentralization involved a total of 1592 permanent representatives in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, 99 of whom had been processed in accordance with the new regulations.
"Sixteen" small-scale consumption survey: the choice is more diverse, and tourism is first.
The Fourth of July is approaching, and people's vacation plans are being finalized.
The recent launch of a mini-survey on the 11th holiday arrangements by the security daily journalists in the friends' circle revealed that while there are different plans, the "Tourism + Consumption" became the key word for the 11th holiday.
Specifically, in the feedback received from the daily Securities Journal, half of the people chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, stated that " during the 11th year he planned to take his family to Shanghai, Disney was the first stop and then go to the surrounding cities " ; Ms. Li in Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan, " a three-legged family left on 28 September and planned a trip around the island for 10 days " ; Ms. Chungqing planned a trip to Singapore; and Mr. Zhang in Hebei chose to travel on his own, saying "The daughter is less than two years old, it's not convenient to leave the country and plans to travel to the east side of the island for a few days " .
A report on trends in the travel and travel of residents of the 2019 National Day Gold Week, published jointly by the Dragon and the recent tour, shows that this year's National Day Golden Week travels and travels, living in three subdivisions, with a clear trend towards an escalation of consumption.
Aeroplanes, high-level iron travels steadily increasing the penetration rate, and the proportion of individualized non-standard accommodation needs in Star-class hotels increasing.
On September 23rd, the "Report on Tourism Consumption Trends on the 2019 National Day of Tourism" released by the United States Corps showed that tourism consumption continues to flourish and that it has grown in diversity.
More young people go out for high-quality, distinctive experiences, cultural tourism, night tourism, etc., and the heat continues to rise.
In addition to tourism, all types of consumption demand were released during the 11th period.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the "Secure Daily" reporter, "The main plan this year is to buy a car."
In Beijing, a staff member at the 4S store said to a reporter in the Securities Journal that, as a rule, September, October of each year, is known as the golden period of car sales.
There'll be a lot of events at the door during the 11th, like a draw, a drop in the store.
A number of brands have recently introduced new models, and the boost to sales is expected to be more visible.
In the context of the upward trend in consumption, greater emphasis has been placed on the satisfaction of mental needs and on the increasing share of consumption of services such as culture, education and so forth.
According to Ms. Du, who lives in Beijing, " Since the birth of the child, culture, education consumption has become the bulk of household consumption spending ...
This year's 11th is full of hours, and we're going to play cards, children's theatres, a couple of family weekends to camp in tents at the Moose Museum, and some trial lessons. "
According to industry sources, the theoretical path of consumer escalation is the evolution of subsistence consumption to developmental and enjoyable consumption, with a significant portion of the consumption of enjoyable consumption being in the service category.
As the country ' s economy and society continue to grow and its income levels rise, there is a growing focus on the spiritual demand for consumption, and tourism is a good way to travel.
Especially in the event of the 11th National Day holiday, with more time and a greater willingness to travel and consume, both to meet the demand for consumption at the spiritual level and as a reflection of the rising consumption of the population.
I've been lonely since the afternoon, and I don't want to go out, and I haven't made up my mind about the fact that the kids aren't around.
Cheer up and say to Nana, the dog: "Mom will take you out of the house."
It's a little bit of an out-of-the-way thing, and the character of type A blood is getting tougher, and it's really weird.
Get the suit, buy the pellets, pay for it, buy the fish chips, and Nana's snacks.
That's why we're going out.
On the phone, I just fell in love with my sister thanks to Nana, or I wouldn't even have an excuse to buy a snack.
He smiled a few times, said the baby called and hung up.
Nana jumps on the bench, gets down on the ground, she knows she's sick, scared, and she doesn't want to be with me.
It's rare that Boo's husband has returned early.
The salads were delicious, and they went to the bedroom to watch TV on the bed.
Take a look at the wall, it's 7 o'clock, it's early in the sunset, it's dark.
It's been invented in the circle of friends. It's Mid-Autumn today.
I washed a bunch of grapes sent by friends, left them half for Boo, and the rest was in the little flower bowl that I liked, and brought out to see the moon.
Sit on the ground with Nana, I eat grapes and she eats skin, and I throw up grape seeds so hard.
The moon hides in the clouds, so the clouds walk, and the moon suddenly comes out, and it's a little obscurous.
All the poems about the moon are in my head, and it's only clear: every three or five cents of the time, it's full of light, it's the last round in the sky.
Maybe we've given the moon too much emotion. I'll tell you now, it's God's and Caesar's Caesar's best.
The moon is the moon, the mood is your own.
After the grapes, it's a cold moon.
The Narnas had a little snoring at their feet, standing up, laying their little blankets on her little house, and Nana was lying there.
Pull the door open and shout, "Is the bath water ready?"
You can't see the moon from the bathroom window, you can only feel the moonlight, you can turn off the bathroom lights, you can't pull the glass.
I didn't eat the moon cake, I didn't drink.

According to incomplete statistics, there are now a number of countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, etc., that have endorsed China's high examination.
In England, for example, Cambridge University, Birmingham University, Lester University, etc. accept Chinese students applying for high school.
Military Machine Dogs first staged the show. The Sun Circus: Consider including the show.
The U.S. Army has funded the development of a "mechanical dog" for use in the field, and it's probably on the stage of the circus now!
The Sun Cirque has recently indicated that it is approaching Boston Dynamics, which is developing robots, to discuss the feasibility of robotic applications to circus performances.
Comprehensive media reports that Boston Power Technology released a promotional film on 24th, "Four-foot robot Spot", which shows Spot as a fast mobile robot weighing 14 kg, highly adapted to the terrain, 360 degrees of shielding, navigation, remote control and autonomy.
In particular, Spot has a proprietary software platform specifically designed for Spot only, and users can customize Spot robotics through various applications.
For the first time, in 1992, Boston Power Technology published the idea of a robot dog, which was sensational, but has yet to be put into commercial use.
However, Boston Dynamics has pointed out that Spot is now in the production phase, and that buyers are mostly construction-based and energy-based.
In addition, the Sun Cirque is currently in contact with Boston Dynamics, and the Sun Cirque says that the plan is still in its conceptual stage and is assessing the potential of Spot to be used at the performance site.

Through a wealth of data and facts, the White Paper describes the great achievements of China ' s development over the past 70 years, their significance and the world ' s contribution.
The White Paper states that China has gone through centuries of development in developed countries, with the economy reaching the second highest in the world, with nearly 1.4 billion people out of material shortages, generally at a level of modesty, enjoying unprecedented dignity and rights.
The White Paper stresses that, for 70 years, the Chinese people have emerged from self-help, struggled hard to create a new world; for 70 years, China has developed in its contacts with the world, embraced the world, learned from it and contributed to it; and for 70 years, China has contributed to world peace while achieving self-development and has injected momentum into the common development of all countries.
The White Paper states that for 70 years, China ' s development has been successful essentially because, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the correct path of China ' s socialism and have steadfastly followed it.
The White Paper emphasizes that China ' s specialist socialist path is a path that has been set out in the national context, a path that places the interests of the people first, a path to reform and innovation, a path to common development in an open world, and a path to a State that is fully governed by the rule of law.

Did Maverick go to a by-election at the State Congress in Danwuby, Johor?
Dato ' Seri Wei Jiang, President of the House of Marawa: " The Supreme Council of the Front of Nations to discuss it! "
It's a matter of concern whether Mahua of the PFDJ party has come to the traditional seat of the nation as Dan Yuu is on the verge of a by-election in the country.
However, after the meeting of the Central Committee of the PFDJ, it was announced that the Supreme Council of the PFDJ would decide whether or not to continue to place the Mavarta traditional seat in the ranks of the other members of the party.
On Thursday afternoon, after presiding over the meeting of the Central Committee of Mahwa, we informed the media that any by-election would be conducted by the PFDJ in accordance with the standard operating procedure (SOP), i.e., after a meeting of the PFDJ Supreme Council.
He said that the PFDJ Supreme Council meeting was expected to take place in early October, as the Election Commission would not meet until Monday (1 day) to finalize the by-elections for the Danyuby-Ai.
" Yesterday morning, I also met with the President of the PFDJ, Dato ' Sri ' Ammozahi, and we all agreed on the need to regain this seat from the League of Hope. "
" We have finalized the convening of a meeting of the leaders of the PFDJ in early October, in which the leaders of the PFDJ three parties will determine which party will fight ... "
Asking whether Marwa would insist on standing in the traditional seat of the PFDJ Supreme Council, Wei Jiaqi reiterated that, as President of the PFDJ, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures and that any decision must therefore be agreed upon by the PFDJ.
" In any by-election, it is common for people to be willing to go out, for political parties, and for some to think that they should come out... "
"What organization and political alliance do we come from?"
" It is a great test of our political alliance over the years, and we believe that the PFDJ has come along with some valuable values ... "
"Someone may say something in the process, and that's weird. "
" But once the Supreme Council of the PFDJ has made a decision, we must all prepare ourselves for war, which is the most valuable... "
In any case, Wei Jia-sang has indicated that Marwa will be fully committed to preparing for the forthcoming by-elections in Danyuby-Ai, at three levels, namely, district councils, state boards and the centre.
" The district council will be headed by the Chairman of the Council of the District (Danboubyi) and the State Board by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the State Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the State of Juazhou, and by the Director of the Board of Directors of the Central Administration, Da Maham Sun, and the Secretary-General, Zhang Zhang Zhang, who will be deployed personally. "
Last Saturday, the Indigenous Unity Party Dan Yui-Ai Member of Congress Dauphin Mohamad Falli died at the stupid Jane government hospital, aged 42, because of heart problems.
A villager hunting wild animals in Paukang County, Hubei, was ordered to make a compulsory mountain patrol.
A villager in Hubei Bokang County was sentenced for hunting wild animals and ordered to pay $15420 for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources (RMB, same as ).
Due to the indigence of the accused ' s family, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office used alternative labour to compensate for the cost of ecological rehabilitation, thus achieving an organic harmonization of legal and social effects.
On the 27th day, Wang Zhonglang, Deputy Attorney-General of the District Attorney's Office of Paukang, informed us that, through alternative labour such as 3 months' compulsory mountain patrol, the defendant had established deep feelings with the wild monkeys and was deeply blamed for his previous animal hunting.
On 21 June this year, a case filed by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Paukang County in the area of criminal incidental civil service in the area of ecological resources was heard in public court and sentenced in court.
The defendant was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and four years' probation and a fine of $3,000 and ordered to pay $15420 for environmental damage to ecological resources.
It was found that Zhou had installed a grid at the cliffs in late January 2014, hunting more than 20 wild animals, including antelopes, twigs, fur crown deer, etc.
Antelopes belong to the endangered wild animals of the second-tier state, and the fur coon deer is listed in the National List of the Protection of Living Wild Animals.
During the trial, Zhou confessed to his unlawful facts and conduct and was willing to assume incidental civil liability.
However, in view of the poor financial situation of one family in the week, the local village council, the forest station, and the three parties in the week reached an agreement on alternative labour to compensate for the cost of ecological rehabilitation: i.e., to provide for the cost of ecological rehabilitation through the operation of a monkey-infestation and care service in the village ' s monkey reserve, compulsory mountain patrols, a year of forest protection, and the provision of public goods to cover the cost of ecological rehabilitation.
With regard to the Prosecutor's proposal, the Court accepted that the obligation to "reimbursement for ecological restoration for alternative labour" should be actively fulfilled while granting a suspended sentence on Monday.
At the moment, Chow has been working for three months in the Monkey Reserve and has been active and performing well.
In recent years, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the county of Paukang has in practice integrated the functions of the prosecution and social governance, using scientific methods of supervision such as the application of prosecutorial recommendations, investigation supervision, prosecution supervision, etc., to minimize the damage to the ecological environment caused by criminal acts through judicial means.
The United Nations awarded the Earthguard Award for Ant Forest.
In a warm round of applause and resounding music, the chief of the Ant Forest project, Seo and the user's representative, Shen Zheng Zhong, came to the table and took the United Nations Earthguard Award for 2019 from the moderator.
In 2019, the Earthguard Award was held in New York, United States of America, on 26th, and the Ant Forest Project, which brought hundreds of millions of people involved in environmental action with cell phones, was awarded the Incentive and Action Award.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced its award list at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but those who participated in the award ceremony on that day were still in a state of shock.
Ingénie Annerson, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, in an interview with Xinhua journalist, said that the Ant Forest is an exciting innovation that allows hundreds of millions of people to take action to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans can do about the environment.
It connects people and the environment with technology, and allows every individual to participate in efforts to protect the planet, which will have a huge impact.
The Ant Forest was launched by the China Ant Financial Services Group in August 2016 at the Pay Treasure Platform, where users accumulate "green energy" by recording green trips to their daily lives in the Ant Forest, paying for water and electricity online, and planting trees in mobile phones.
Every time a user grows a virtual tree, ant forest and a public good partner grow a real tree in a desertification area.
As of August this year, 500 million "Ant Forest" users had accumulated carbon reductions of 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertification areas.
In the Earthguard Award awarded that day, Costa Rica won the prize for its national environmental efforts, and the President of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado, who presented the award on the spot, praised the contribution of the Ant Forest, "which has inspired so many people to participate in green action and is impressive."
The chairman and CEO of the ants gold suit, Hyun-do Well, said that the Earthguard Award was a recognition of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for people to participate in low-carbon lives, an honour that belongs to all participants.
Hyeon-Do said that the ant forest has affected 500 million people in the last three years and that the goal of the ant forest for the next three years is to engage a billion people globally in low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase farmers' income from green water in the mountains.
In addition to providing employment through tree planting, it is hoped to help farmers to grow through agricultural development projects, electric power platforms, etc.
The public good model based on digital technology, created by the Ant Forest, has also been successfully explored by other countries.
In June this year, the largest electronic purse in the Philippines, GCash, launched the Philippine version of Ant Forest to encourage Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.
It was described that GCash, in collaboration with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, Environmental Public Interest, etc., planned to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of project launch.
The Earthguard Award is the highest award in the environmental field of the United Nations and is awarded annually.
The "Ant Forest" award was awarded to the Green Innovation Project from China for the third year in a row, following the "Incentive and Action Award" project by the builder of the Sehan Dam forest in China, the "Shunmura Demonstration" in Zhejiang Province, China.
Trade friction affects the U.S. economy.
The United States economic report card for the second quarter of this year shows that the United States gross domestic product (GDP) growth was significantly slower than in the previous quarter, as a result of a sharp decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts pointed out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they created were the main causes of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the United States Department of Commerce on 26 June show that US GDP grew by 2 per cent per year in the second quarter, the same as the revised data published earlier, but significantly below 3.1 per cent in the first quarter.
Data show that consumption growth is a major factor underpinning the growth of the United States economy in the second quarter.
Individual consumption spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the United States economy, increased by 4.6 per cent in the current season, boosting economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment declined by 6.3 per cent in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter, delaying economic growth by 1.16 per cent in the current quarter; exports declined by 5.7 per cent compared to the previous quarter, and net exports slowed down by 0.68 per cent in the current quarter.
According to Barry Knapp, managing partner of Einside macroeconomic consulting firms in the United States, not only did private sector investment fail to maintain the momentum of last year's growth, but it fell sharply because of the damage to business confidence caused by economic friction and increased uncertainty.
According to Knap, United States corporate capital spending is expected to continue to decline next year under the influence of policy uncertainty.
Analysts argue that, while consumption growth has strongly supported the United States economy in the second quarter, there are increasing indications that trade and trade friction and the uncertainty it brings have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the United States consumption prospects.
The head of the survey, Richard Cotting, Professor of Economics, University of Michigan, recently stated that in the most recent survey, 38 per cent of consumers had spontaneously referred to the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, a percentage that was a year and a half high.
With regard to future economic developments in the United States, analysts generally believe that the United States economy will continue to slow down.
However, it was also suggested that the performance of the United States industrial sector and financial markets would improve if trade and trade friction were eased.
The British Economist think tank global economist, Karin Burch, predicts that in the future the United States economy will continue its downward trend since this year and that the rate of growth will fall to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandy, Chief Economist of Moody Analysis, predicts that, assuming that economic and trade friction does not continue to escalate, the United States economy will grow by 2.3 per cent this year, slowing further to 1.6 per cent next year.
According to Ellen Hartyn, Investment Manager of Patnam Investment, the biggest concern of the enterprise today is the economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they bring, which, if resolved, will be significantly reduced and the industry will perform much better than it is today.
According to Matt Melly, stock strategist in Miller-Tabak Asset Management, economic and trade friction remains a " top priority " and is the main cause of the large volatility of the United States capital market this year, and the proper resolution of trade and economic friction will be the key to influencing the direction of American capital markets for the rest of the year.
The first joint parental leave for couples in Ningxia is 10 days per year for parents with children aged 0 to 3 years
Ensuring the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important indicator of the progress of civil society.
On 27 September, at the fifteenth session of the Standing Committee of the 12th People ' s Congress of the Ningxia-Region Autonomous Region, the Regulation on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women of the Ningxia-Region Autonomous Region was adopted.
This is a local regulation issued by the first province of Ningxia for a comprehensive and systematic defence of the legitimate rights and interests of women, which will be implemented as of 1 November 2019.
It is understood that the regulations adopted on this occasion were amended in 2007 on the basis of the Ningxia Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women, and are divided into 9 chapters, article 65, which includes general principles, political rights, cultural and educational rights and interests, labour and social security rights and interests, property rights and interests, personal rights, marital and family rights and interests, legal responsibilities, by-laws.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encourages the exploration of joint parental leave, which is the first of its kind in the country.
In April this year, the "Guidance on Promoting the Development of Child Care Services for Children under the Age of 3" issued by the Office of the State Council contained a description of the joint parenthood of couples.
In the course of the revision of the Regulations, Ningxia 's innovation was to encourage employers to take care of couples with children who are in compliance with the law, and the regulations provide for joint parental leave of 10 days each year between the ages of 0 and 3 years.
At the same time, the Ordinance highlights the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Ordinance incorporates the most recent legislative developments in China's current Personal Status Code, detailing the elements of sexual harassment, the main subjects and mechanisms against sexual harassment, etc.
Article 44 of the Ordinance explicitly prohibits the occurrence of sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to provide education, protection and prevention as new paradigms in local legislation for the protection of girls.
With regard to women's right to know and dispose of marital and family property, article 35 of the Ordinance clearly defines women's right to know and to register property and the obligations of the relevant subjects, providing solid institutional support for women's defence of their rights.
In addition, in response to social hotspots — gender discrimination in employment — section 26 of the Ordinance prohibits not only direct discrimination, but also indirect discrimination, and draws on recent experience in joint interviews, strengthens penalties for gender-based discrimination and strengthens the defence of women’s legitimate rights.
In recent years, the Ningxia Women ' s Union ' s Joint Public Prosecutor ' s Office, Civil Affairs, etc., have been very effective in promoting and introducing social and professional involvement in marital and family dispute mediation and in combating domestic violence.
This is summarized and promoted by the Regulations, which in several laws encourage the mobilization of social forces, the pooling of social resources to defend women's rights and interests, and require the people's governments above the county level to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support, including through the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia, UNITA's Yuanlong Pilgrim Station is saline rice acre for rice.
Journalists were informed by the UNITA administration in the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia on 27 January that the recent meeting of the Congress of Acceptance and Inspection of Salt-Salin Rice at the Xin UNITA Yuan Ping Station, an average of 1,000 pounds of rice produced by salin rice, had been released.
A team of six experts from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Hunan Province, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of Heilongjiang Province, conducted a sample harvest of rice from the "Hingsa salt series" on site.
According to expert estimates, the average saline-resistant rice acre is 508.8 kg of rice on land with a salinity level of 5 to 6 per 1,000.
Wang Shik, Chief of the Executive Station at the Yuanlong Park Station of Heung UNITA, said: " We intend to build on this year ' s experiment and to innovate and reform to replant and optimize saline-resistant rice varieties to make them better quality and more productive ... "
The researcher, Vice-President of the Agricultural Academy of Sciences of Heilongjiang Province, who chaired the expert group on measuring production, said at last: " I believe that while the factors of production remain constant, the continuous strengthening of the scientific and technological response will continue to produce miracles in salinized rice ... "
UNITA is part of a cluster of special hardship areas in the Xinang Province.
In October 2018, Yuan Long Pilgrim worked on UNITA's showdown.
Yuanlong Pilgrim led the team of experts to speed up the introduction of the latest developed "saline-resistant hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technologies, to build 960 acres of saline-resistant rice base on the central flag of the Kolgian right wing, to use pilot demonstration at the border, to promote technical routes to boost the production and income of the local poor and to lift them out of poverty.
This saline-resistant rice field survey provides a scientific basis for not only raising UNITA saline low-yielding fields to high- and medium-yielding fields, but also for the cultivation of saline rice under the same conditions in our country.
According to Australianet, on September 26, local time, following a marathon debate and weeks of protests, the new state of Australia passed a bill to legalize abortion.

At the central level, three transfers of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been completed, totalling approximately 8,60.1 billion yuan in State capital.
Of these, the transfer of central financial institutions from the Ministry of Finance to carry out the responsibility of financiers has largely been completed.
Central enterprise conversions have taken place on a certain scale.
At the local level, enterprises move ahead.
By the end of 2018, pilot work had been completed in Yunnan Provinces, transferring State capital of $15.8 billion and $18.5 billion, respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have successive pre-transfer preparations, laying the groundwork for the next transition.
According to a joint circular issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the National Investment Commission, the General Tax Administration and the CSR, the transfer of part of the State-owned capital to the Social Security Fund was fully rolled out in 2019 and substantially completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on that day made a concrete deployment of the full roll-out.
It was emphasized that the transition process should be carried out in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
"In accordance with the schedule of progress, the transition will be substantially completed by 2020...
The transfer of working hours is tight and the task is heavy ... "
Liu Quan said that in the regions, departments need to be well-organized and well-organized to ensure that the transition is completed as required; to move forward in a solid manner to capture accurately the elements of the transfer policy; and to improve communication coordination and timely resolution of problems.
The National Transfer of Resources to Strengthen the Social Security Fund (SWF) - Starting from the start of the FSB Money Bag, the destination is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, I think it's not a simple "physical shift", but it's a "mathematical addition."
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Welfare, the National Investment Commission, the General Tax Administration Board and the CSR issued a joint " Circular on the Full Transfer of Part of the State Capital to Supplement the Work of the Social Security Fund " , specifying the schedule for the transfer of State funds to the Social Security Fund, i.e., the full roll-out of the Central and Local Transfer of Part of the State Capital to Supplement the Work of the Social Security Fund in 2019.
After the release of the document, the Ministry of Finance and others were able to implement it quickly.
On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance transferred to the Social Security Fund 10 per cent of the holdings of the business banks and agricultural banks, with the transfer of two shares to a total value of more than $115 billion.
According to the regulations, the recipients, such as the Social Security Foundation, as financial investors, have the right to receive, dispose of and be informed of the State-owned equity rights that have been allocated to them.
The Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in its bulletin, states that this change in entitlement will not result in a change in the shareholders of the Bank and the actual controlling person.
In response, the author argues that similar transfers of State equity are not simple changes in equity attribution, but "additional calculations" that can trigger a series of effects.
The first step of some State transfers to social security, the "plus result " , can naturally reflect universal ownership of State-owned enterprises and the sharing of development results.
After many years of reform and development, State enterprises, in particular conglomerates, are mostly in important sectors and sectors of our economy, and are generally more profitable and stable.
Among them, the lead firms are more likely to be able to do well on an ongoing basis.
On July 10, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided that this year the transfer of some State-owned capital to fund the work of the Social Security Fund would be fully rolled out.
The Ministry of Finance has subsequently indicated that it will work with the relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Committee of the State Council, to make a comprehensive transfer of some State-owned capital to the Social Security Fund, fully reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the sharing of the results of State-owned enterprise development among the population.
The second step of the transition, the "Additional Results " , is to enhance the sustainability of our social security fund and strengthen the foundations of the social security system for old age.
With the ageing of the population, our social security funds are under pressure, and most of the national funds that have been transferred to it are of a continuing profit-making and cash-sharing capacity, not only to effectively supplement the social security fund, but also to provide a source of water for the fund.
Measurements show that the contribution rate for basic old-age insurance in enterprises can be reduced by 1 percentage point for each 3.8 percentage point transfer of State capital.
The third step of the transition, "Additional results", is to add stabilizers to the capital market.
This transfer is made in the form of a "red-dominated operation supported by a " .
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor in State-owned capital, does have a strong stake in receiving dividends.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, the Social Security Fund has a strong capacity to operate capital.
For listed assets in State capital, the participation of the Social Security Fund in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of the listed enterprises, contribute to the upgrading of the business and have a positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
At the same time, the rise in equity weights of the Social Security Fund, as an investment windfall, has helped to further increase its influence in the market and to act as a "stabilizer" in the market.
In addition, it helps to optimize the value discovery function of institutional investors and direct investors to rational investment and value investment.
Karl Hartmann, 18 years old, was admitted to the Leipzig Conservatory, followed by a teacher from Weibourne.
After the Nazis came to power, Hartmann resisted first in the form of works not published in Germany, and then even stopped making them.
In 1933, he created Miserae and dedicated it to "My Sleeping Friends."
In 1935, this symphony was inaugurated in Prague, but was harassed by Nazi bureaucrats.
Then Hartmann decided not to play any of his works under Nazi rule.
Hartmann's funeral concerto was a violin and string concerto when the manuscript was stolen out of Germany and the premiere was held in Switzerland.
Please listen to the funeral concert at Beethoven's Music Festival in 2018 by the Berne Indoor Orchestra.

Since the first parade on the 35th anniversary of the National Day, every time a military parade is organized, there will be a troupe of strategic missile forces.
"It was the first time that the Rockets appeared to be on An Street after the National Day parade, when "the army" turned into "the army."
The commander of the Rocket Armaments Unit, Wang Bo, said...
The missile-reading forces are fully capable of special hardship, combat, dedication, discipline, scientific group training and training, reflecting three main features throughout the training, presenting a good image of strategic forces and a greater focus on rigorous conduct.

They are required to hold each gate, keep a close eye on each detail, allow the parade to withstand the hammer, and truly make the national parade a training and testing ground to enhance the force's combat capability.
Iran has been confirmed to have developed advanced centrifuges and further suspended its nuclear protocol.
On September 27, China Newsnet, according to Central News, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated on September 26 that Iran had once again violated Iran's nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium.
It is reported that Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran Nuclear Agreement in response to the withdrawal of United States President Trump from the Iran Nuclear Agreement in May 2018 and the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran has suspended two other commitments in July to keep uranium enrichment stocks below 300 kg and uranium enrichment levels below 3.67%, with further moves now.
In accordance with the nuclear agreement, Iran could only plant about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, and only a small number of more advanced machine types were allowed to be used by Iran for research, but no enriched uranium was produced.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for the manufacture of nuclear bombs.
According to the report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported: " On 25 September, the Agency has confirmed that Iran ' s advanced centrifuges of type 2, machine 3 are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium ... "
This report was presented to Member States on 26 June by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency, and a diplomatic official responded: " They are busy at the Uranium Enrichment Facility in Natanz ... "

The first auto-driving taxi teams started the test operation.
Yesterday, 100 degrees in Changsha announced that the auto-driving taxi team, Robotaxi, was officially operational.
The first 45 Apollo and a red flag, the Red Flag Robotaxi fleet, have started to operate in the open-test sections of the Changsha sector.
As of this day, ordinary citizens of Changsha will be able to access the Apollo network to apply for seed user status and have the opportunity to take the experience.
An experienced passenger said that he was sitting in the back of a vehicle, clicking on the front screen of the passenger's seat, opening the auto-drive process.
Inside the vehicle, for the safety of passengers and as required by current policy regulations, the pilot operation of the vehicle is conducted with a security officer at the driver ' s seat to maximize passenger safety.
In the course of the journey, the vehicle can be intelligently rerouted according to the condition of the road. It can also determine the condition of the vehicle in the vicinity and make automatic evasive arrangements, for example, in the case of a close-range overcar.
Throughout the journey, the passenger area screens show the lives of pedestrians, cars and even some traditional blind areas in real time.
Even if the vehicle is shielded, we can see in advance the changes in the front light and the waiting time. All traffic is clear.
The drones used to hear it on TV, thought it was far from us, but it was amazing to find it in our lives today.
We look forward to its coming into real civilian life.
In June 2019, Apollo received 45 portable test plates issued by the Changsha Municipality.
At present, Changsha's auto-pilot testing open roads through the City of Changsha City, the City of Artificial Smart Technology, Lake May Creek, Lake Ocean, the Great Mount, the High New Zone, and so forth, amounting to 135 kilometres in length and 70 square kilometres in the model area, constitute the longest distance, the largest area, the most complex area to cover, and the most advanced intelligent driving demonstration area in China.
It is expected that by the end of 2019, the Apollo Robotaxi fleet will have a pilot road in Changsha covering approximately 50 km, with plans to cover 135 km of the current open road in Changsha in the first half of 2020.

China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
White Paper: China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper states that China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper says that with China's combined national strength and international influence rising rapidly, there are international fears that China will follow the path of "the powerful" and some have put forward the so-called "China threat theory".
It's both cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalances brought about by power erosion, and deliberate distortions in defence of their vested interests.
The attainment of national prosperity, the revitalization of the nation and the well-being of the people are both the dream of the Chinese people and the common dream of all peoples.
" China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge ... "
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of world economic growth, that China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, that China ' s scientific and technological innovations have injected new dynamics into world economic growth and that the future role of China ' s economic stabilizers and engines has become more prominent.
The current world economy is not sufficiently dynamic, and a robust Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to the world.
China ' s economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, accelerated modernization of agriculture, structural adjustment of the economy, industrial optimization, and the emergence of new economic growth points.
" A study by the McKinsey Institute of Global Studies concluded that by 2040, China ' s integration with the rest of the world ' s economies is expected to create an economic value of $22 trillion to $37 trillion, equivalent to 15 to 26 per cent of the global economy, and that enhanced cooperation between the rest of the world ' s economies and China would create significant economic value ... "
The White Paper emphasizes that China ' s economy has undergone structural changes and has been deeply integrated into the world economy.
A more stable economy, a better quality of growth and a more sustainable growth outlook for China would be of long-term benefit to the world economy.
Treating China ' s economic development as a "threat" and a "challenge" and trying to squeeze China out of global industrial chains, supply chains, value chains and decoupling China from the world economy is neither feasible nor harmful.
The White Paper states that full open access creates more opportunities for countries to share the Chinese dividend.
China is determined to pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win open-door strategy, with greater intensity and higher levels of openness to the outside world. China has the world's most promising consumer markets. China is the most attractive destination for investment, and more large-scale "go-out" benefits more countries.
"Openness should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, one side benefiting.
Both directions of mutual benefit will be sustainable in the long term ... "
The White Paper states that China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment, enhancing intellectual property protection, and that other countries should expand their openness and take corresponding initiatives in an effort to improve their business environment.
Only by moving in the opposite direction can an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment be created, and a mutually beneficial, win-win community of interests emerge from the "cake" of development.
According to the White Paper, China provides more public goods to the international community.
Including the promotion of high-quality " all the way " to multilateral dialogue and cooperation, active participation in international and regional affairs and active external assistance.
" China ' s development has benefited from the international community and has never forgotten to give back to the family of nations to provide the international community with more and better public goods ... "
In a written interview with a reporter from Xinhua, the General Manager of the Russian Export Centre, Andrei Slipniv, expressed Russia ' s willingness to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic and trade fields, further optimize its export structure and promote the diversification of Russian exports to China.
According to Slipniov, while the forestry industry accounts for a significant proportion of Russian exports to China, exports of agricultural products are also important, including oil, meat and dairy products, and cereals, fish and marine products.
In recent years, Russian non-material and non-energy exports to China have also shown good and steady growth.
Turning to Russia’s optimization of its export structure to China, Slapnoov said that the Russian side had set a mandate to expand exports of high-technology products to meet the import demand for high-technology products from countries and regions around the world, including China.
The Russian Federation will then improve its financial and non-financial support measures and promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
Sripniov stated that the Russian side was willing to export building technology and high-tech building materials to China and to develop cooperation with China in such areas as medicine, air manufacturing, etc.
There is also great potential for cooperation between Russia and China in the field of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russian products in many areas were "quality superior and price competitive" compared to Western products of similar kind.
Referring to the two countries' goal of achieving $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2024, Sripniov said that areas such as agriculture, mechanical manufacturing, the chemical industry and forestry would play an important role in achieving that goal.
The Russian side intends to promote the diversification of supply in these areas and the export of deep-processed products.
He stressed that the Russian side intended to push its exporters into the global value-added chain, of which China was one of the development directions.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas, and chemicals are well placed to participate in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises " to establish more Russian-Chinese joint ventures and jointly develop exports to third countries " .
According to Slipniov, Russian export centres are supporting Chinese exports of Russian products through various measures and services of the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank.
At the same time, the Russian export centres will continue to deepen their cooperation with the relevant Chinese authorities in order to facilitate easier access to the Chinese market for Russian goods and to develop new categories of Chinese exports.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the so-called diplomatic breakthrough:
In response to a recent visit to United Nations Headquarters by Chinese officials to attend a conference on religious issues, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China responded at a regular press conference that such a small act would be a disgraceful one.
According to reports from the Taiwan press, Taipei New York office personnel had recently entered United Nations Headquarters to attend a conference on religious issues in the United States and called it a "diplomatic breakthrough " .
The meeting you mentioned was a side event at the United States premises, not a United Nations meeting.
He said that the people were sneaking into the United Nations, disparaging themselves, and that it was called a diplomatic breakthrough, and that it was a disgraceful little move and a big smile.
He noted that the United Nations had repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to addressing the Taiwan issue in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2758, and that the United Nations membership at large had adhered to the one-China principle.

The protests have struck the President down in the Egyptian mountains, and the authorities have shown a strong crackdown.
Twitter theme tags and social media are campaigning for Egyptians to take to the streets today and peacefully appeal for President Sessi to step down.
But the authorities have made it clear that they intend to use force to suppress it.
Since Sessi, then head of the military, staged a military coup in 2013 to seize power, the expression of dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest is at greater risk.
The British Guardian reports that the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, a non-governmental organization in Cairo, has stated that more than 1,900 people have been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests last weekend demanding the removal of Sessi.
The allegations of corruption surrounding Sessi's and his family's wasteful pursuit of vanity led thousands of people to march on the streets in 20 days.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior firmly stated yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country would be met with determination and no mercy.
The city centre of Cairo is already heavily guarded, with riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes policemen everywhere on the streets around Tahrir Square, where the Egyptian revolution blew up in 2011.
Al-Jazeera reports that security forces detained several leading scholars and sociologists for 25 days, including Professor of Political Science at Cairo University and well-known columnist Nafa.
In his 24th tweet, he said: " I have no doubt that the continuation of Cessy ' s absolute rule will cause disaster ... "
"It is in Egypt ' s interest that he be removed immediately. "
Before Nafa was arrested, Hosni, who was the spokesperson of Anna Anna, former chief of staff of the Egyptian military, was detained.
Anna was arrested last year after trying to compete with Sessi for the presidency.
The president of the Constitutional Party, Davud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians argue that, at a time when the economic plight of the poor and middle class is worsening, the scrambling of dissidents is a reflection of the instability and fragility of the government.
The leader of the opposition, Ayman Nour, who once ran for the presidency, said: " The capture highlights the regime ' s disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fear ... "
" As the economy has been ruined by him, coupled with widespread political oppression, Sessi has tried to send a clear message to the important generals and politicians who may replace him ... "
Noor notes that, in the context of the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the Government's use of high-handed tactics will only increase the anger of the people.
Now that the barrier of fear has been broken, he expects more people to go to the streets.
A businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain, Ali, who was an Egyptian military construction contractor, started uploading a series of videos early in the month, claiming to benefit from government corruption, setting off a small wave of demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali said that his company, the Amrack General Contract, could be awarded a lucrative contract without a legal bidding process, emphasizing the corruption of the military and members of the family of Cessy, including the First Lady, Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was very sorry to have been involved in it.
Ali claims that he helped the luxurious palace and the luxury hotel in Sesage, in stark contrast to the extreme poverty of the Egyptians today, and that the other party has not yet paid for it.
On Twitter, tags such as "Stand up and you're not alone," "Cessy's dead," "Cessy's gone," and "Friday Next" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and backs, calling for people to walk peacefully on the streets and ask for Cessy to step down.
The Egyptian man of Hollywood, Amarwick, has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
Yesterday he tweeted in Arabic: " Cesci is doomed... he is finished, and those who support him are now going to make a big mistake. "

The Director of the Labour and Welfare Bureau of the HKSAR Government, Luo Chiang, and the Director of Business and Economic Development, Qiu Tenghua, have commissioned the Employees Retraining Bureau to carry out special training programmes and measures to support the tourism industry to meet with the media.
Luo Guang has described the challenges facing the Hong Kong economy as imminent and should not wait until the situation is calm.
So, the HKSAR government has launched a free training program called "Special? Love Value Added".
It was explained that persons who were unemployed or had been asked by their employers to leave without pay as of 1 June had the opportunity to participate in the programme, provided that the relevant requirements were met.
The most important part of the wide range of courses, the most important of which is "Professional Skills" training, which covers 19 industries, including tourism, retail and catering, as well as a number of brand-new "Innovated Technology" courses and cross-practice "Universal Skills" courses.
Yu Peng Chun, Chairman of the Employees Retraining Board, stated that all course fees were free and that the plan was expected to support approximately 10,000 people in need.
The participants in the programme receive a special allowance of HK$4,000 per student per month for each full-time or part-time course and 80 per cent attendance.
It was described that the training course, which lasted between two and three months, was provided by some 50 training institutions and that citizens could read it in the newspaper from 3 October to 31 March next year, with up to four courses per person.
In addition, the HKSAR Government has also announced a series of measures to support the tourism industry and to assist industry in overcoming the crisis.
These measures include easing the allocation of funds to the Tourism Council, funding 6,000 guided tours to renew their booking courses, exemption of travel agents from annual fees, etc.
You're tired of sports, aren't you?
According to Russian satellite networks, a study of athletes shows signs of brain fatigue after high-intensity exercise.
This study, led by Mathieus Pesigrión, expert at the Pittier-Salpetrill Hospital in France, shows that there is no obvious link between intellectual and manual labour: both require cognitive control of activities.
Pesgreón explains: " You need to control the autonomous process of forcing yourself to stop when muscles and joints are in pain ... "
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Physical Education and Sport (INSEP).
The school's specialists are responsible for preparing athletes for the Olympics.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from over-training syndromes, i.e. an irresistible sense of fatigue after high-load exercise, inability to recover and a decline in performance.
INSEP asks the question: Is part of this disease caused by nervous fatigue, which is caused by over-drained labour?
The study was published in the journal Contemporary Biology.

Make it easier for Chinese citizens to "go out" - to visit Choi Ae-min, head of the consular department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Wherever you go, the country is behind you.
On the 25th, the first Foreign Minister's consular protection short film came online, and the closing phrase of the short film resonates with a wide range of netizens.
In an interview with Xinhua journalist, Choi Aemin, Director of Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that the short film was intended to give the public a greater sense of the love and temperature of "diplomatic for people" and to make Chinese citizens feel that whether they are in any part of the world, Chinese diplomats will lend them help, help, strength and hope.
There's nothing wrong with being abroad. It's always about a leaf.
CHOI Amin stated that over the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens "going out" has increased dramatically, from less than a million per year before the reform and opening up to more than a billion times a year; at the same time, Chinese citizens travelling abroad are more secure, and consular protection and assistance are extended from overseas to various groups such as Chinese expatriates, tourists, students, workers, etc.
According to statistics, since the 18th Congress of the Party, we have organized more than 10 major evacuations or relocations of Chinese citizens abroad, evacuating more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
About 500,000 cases involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens were received and dealt with in a coordinated manner.
In times of danger, the country can take you home; it's no longer a dream.
According to Choi Aemin, by the end of August this year China had concluded visa waiver agreements with 14 countries covering ordinary passport personnel.
In addition, an increasing number of countries have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens entry facilities such as visa waivers or landing visas.
In Thailand, 42 countries and territories, such as Egypt, unilaterally granted entry visas to Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports, while 15 countries, such as Indonesia, unilaterally granted exemption from entry to Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports.
In addition to visa waivers and landing arrangements, Chinese citizens are becoming easier to obtain visas and procedures are becoming simpler.
By the end of August, China had concluded agreements or arrangements with 41 countries to simplify visa procedures.
Among them are the United States of America, Canada, Israel, Argentina, the granting of multi-visa visas to each other for 10 years, the United Kingdom, business, the issuance of multi-visa arrangements for two years for family visits, etc.
In the United Kingdom, Belgium co-sponsored the "visa one-stop" service, while France, Italy and Singapore reduced the processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who travel abroad frequently, multiple entry, the APEC Business Travel Card is a good option.
According to Choi Aemin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining more than five visas in 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific region, which means a lot to business people, especially private business people.
At present, China has the highest number of effective cardholders in the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote more countries to adopt visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, translate the results of diplomatic work into pro-people initiatives, and continuously increase the " gold content " of Chinese passports.

The United States will deploy additional air defence systems and forces in Saudi Arabia
The U.S. Department of Defense announced on 26th, that as a result of the previous attack on Saudi oil facilities, the U.S. would deploy an additional "patriotic" air defence system, 4 groups of "Sentry" radar systems and approximately 200 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.

Two months after being detained by Iran, the British tanker "Stanner Empire" was finally released, leaving for international waters in the morning of 27 hours from the Iranian port of Abbas.
And just in the middle of last month, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory just released an Iranian tanker that had been detained for over a month.
According to the news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, at 9 a.m. local time, the British tanker "Stanner Empire" departed from the port of Abbas to the international waters of the Persian Gulf.
Iran ' s Ports and Shipping Organization in Hormuzgan confirmed that the ship ' s commander and crew had made a formal and written commitment and that although the ship had been seized, they had not claimed any compensation.
Stena Bulk, the Swedish shipowner of the Steiner Empire, also said that the ship was sailing from the port of Abbas.
In addition, the vessel tracking data of Refinitiv also revealed that the tanker had moved on 27 and left the port of Abbas.
This British-flagged Steena Impero tanker was seized by Iran in July this year.
The company's spokesman said the tanker was about to leave Abbas.
Two weeks after the British seized an Iranian tanker in the waters of Gibraltar, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker Steena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz.
The ship was released in August.
Earlier this week, the spokesman of the Iranian government stated that all the legal procedures required for the release of the "Stanner Empire" had been completed.
But the Iranians say the investigation is still under way.
Many Iranian media have also released videos of the tanker's departure.
On 19 July, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy detained a British tanker, the "Stanner Empire", in Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz, and then took it to Abbas port.
Iran was taken from the waters of Gibraltar by the tanker Grace 1.
In addition, on 4 July, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory seized the oil tanker Grace I, carrying Iranian crude oil, in the Strait of Gibraltar on suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.
More than a month later, on 15 August, the Gibraltar authorities announced the release of Grace I.
This afternoon, a conference was held in Changsha on the subject of educational review and rehabilitation in undergraduate colleges across the province.
Ulan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Council, stressed the need to raise political standing, strengthen political responsibility, take a critical look at the problem and reform it with a view to improving the effectiveness of education in higher education and the quality of the development of policies and reforms.
Ulan fully acknowledges the initial results achieved by the undergraduates in the second series of thematic education.
She pointed out that the implementation of the theme "Don't forget, remember the mission" was a major deployment at the party centre, and that undergraduates had to learn to follow up on the important message of the General Secretary of Xi Jinping about the theme "Don't forget the mission."
From increasing the "four consciousness" to "two preservation " , to fulfilling the political high of the original mission, to carefully accomplishing the actions of the various provisions of the subject education, particularly to overhaul the whole range of issues that emerge from the examination, and to integrate all aspects of school reform and development into a " two-by-one promotion " .
Ulan stressed that it was important to stick to the inside, catch up on the problem, follow the "four-check-and-check" requirement, find out the correctness of the mark, ask for the views of teachers and students, parents and all sectors of society, and seriously and seriously examine the root causes of the problem in order to clarify the direction of the effort and improve it, and find a way to solve the problem.
You have to be precise, you've got to make real changes, and you've got to keep the word "change" running.
We need to work on a combination of thematic education and "Led Trees" work, and we need to make sure that the problem is clear and we need to make it work.
We have to stick to both the symptoms and the symptoms, improve the long-lasting mechanisms, weave the cages, strengthen the rigidity of the system, and ensure that the work is disciplined, disciplined and truly managed by the system.
In keeping with the above, the leadership has to take the lead in strengthening the theoretical force, taking the lead in taking a critical look at the changes, taking the lead with a strict sense of self-regulation, and playing the role of a "key minority" model, trying to accomplish the tasks of the thematic education review and overhauling.
Henan University and five higher education committees are in charge of the comrades, and the provincial authorities are in charge of the gays.
"One turn at a time" two very high-pressure projects were shipped.
On 26th, the direct transmission of electricity from the proximate east to the ± 1100 kV high volts project, and the delivery of the Soton 1000 kV high-pressure GIL complex project.
Both of these projects represent the highest production points in the current world of power transmission technologies, which will allow for a significant increase in the country's energy-intensive optimal configuration.
According to Guo Ji-ji, the General Economist of the National Energy Agency, the Trans-East-Kingnan Project is the world ' s most capable and most distant transmission project.
Their transport is important for promoting energy base development in Xinjiang and guaranteeing electricity supply in East China.
GIL, the gas insulated metal, shuts down the transmission line.
The Sutton Pipeline Project, which created a record of the highest level of global voltage and the highest transmission capacity in the GIL Project, brought about the `twice-ringing' chain of operation of the highest voltage level of the China-East backbone grid.
According to the National Electricity Network Company, the distance of power transmission from the para-east to the Zhongnan Project is 3324 km.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15 per cent of electricity will be lost in transit, and the project has been developed and developed, raising the economic transport distance significantly to over 3,000 kilometres.
After the launch of the para-east-to-south project, 100 million degrees of electrical power can be delivered every 8 hours and can help break down the new sources of energy available in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, this line alone will reach 60 to 85 billion kilowatt hours per year, meeting more than half of Shanghai ' s electricity supply throughout the year.
The Sutton GIL complex is a controlled project across the Yangtze River through a high-pressure communication ring.
Using conventional open lines across the river requires the installation of two giant iron towers over 450 metres over the Yangtze River and the construction of an artificial island of more than four football fields per tower.
In response, the national grid was boldly innovative in developing a compact high-pressure exchange GIL transmission technology, passing through the river through tunnels and avoiding the impact on the Golden Channel.
Two projects led to a new leap in our electrician equipment manufacturing capacity.
So far, the national grid has built up a 10-to- 11 high-pressure project, and 4-to-3 is under construction.
Foreign exchange bureaux: our external debt structure continues to improve
" On the whole, our external debt structure continues to optimize and the stability of our external debt has increased ... "
According to the press spokesman of the National Foreign Exchange Administration, Wang Chun Ying, the chief economist, 27th, the country ' s main external debt indicators are within internationally recognized security lines and external debt risks are generally manageable.
Wang Chun-Ying made this statement when he published data on the foreign debt of the end of June 2019 at the Foreign Exchange Office, in response to a question from a journalist.
According to the data, by the end of June 2019, the country ' s total-calibre (including foreign currency) external debt balance stood at US$ 1998 billion, an increase of US$ 26.3 billion, or 1.3 per cent, over the end of March 2019, mainly as a result of the increase in debt stock balances.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 per cent of the increase in the country's total-calibre external debt was driven by the purchase of domestic renminbi bonds by non-residents, who are predominantly medium- and long-term investors, such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, medium- and long-term external debt increased by 3 percentage points compared to the end of March 2019 and by 1 percentage point compared to the end of March 2019.
According to Wang Chun Ying, international investors' recognition of China's bond market has increased with the inclusion of renminbi bonds in our country's global composite index in April 2019.
" Our balance of payments is generally balanced and external debt risks are manageable ... "
Reporters learned from the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences that at present the moths in Yunnan grassland are effectively protected, without causing large-scale outbreaks, and that the prevention and control work has achieved milestones.
In January this year, for the first time ever, Yunnan Pu-Meng County discovered grassland night moths that had been moved from abroad, which were subsequently confirmed in 129 Yunnan counties, and gradually spread from Yunnan to China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.
Grassland night moths are important agricultural pests born in the tropics and subtropical regions of the Americas that are food-rich and remotely ejective, and are characterized by the FAO Global Early Warning System as "international, ejective, violent and destructive".
The pest endangers corn, sugar cane, sorghum, and more than 80 crops, with large amounts of food, causing up to 70 per cent of production losses.
It's very difficult to control it. China has no registered pesticide for the disease.
Since the grassland night moths moved into Yunnan, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences has selected Eedong Fellows to lead the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences ' cross-border harmful organisms in agriculture, in collaboration with the Green Control and Control Department ' s innovation team, to the front line, field surveys, sample collection and technical guidance and pilot demonstration.
The Aethon team has developed an initial population profile of night moths in Yunnangrass, natural insect resources, alien insect-source characteristics, migration trajectory of populations, poisons and field control effects.
They have been active in research and application of green-control technologies, through the implementation of new green-control technologies, such as stock monitoring, insect traps, scientific medicines and agronomic measures, which have had over 90 per cent of their effectiveness in the demonstration area, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural enemy resources and the ecological environment, and providing technical safeguards for Yunnan to effectively control the eruption of grassland night moths and sustainable governance.
At present, the moths in Yunnan grassland are effectively protected, without causing large-scale outbreaks, and the control has achieved milestones.
Next, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on the ecological mechanisms of stock migrations and invasions, breaking through biocontrol and green technology systems.
At the same time, international cross-border cooperation has been actively promoted with a view to establishing joint priority laboratories and joint monitoring sites and demonstration areas outside the country to enhance the full range of surveillance and early warning capabilities of the moths in the Yunnan meadows.

White Paper: China ' s way out of a country-specific development path
China News Agency, Beijing, September 27th, China State Council News Office released the White Paper "China and the World for a New Era" on September 27th.
According to the White Paper, for 70 years, the Chinese people have worked hard to find and move forward, successfully opening the path of Chinese socialism and achieving remarkable development achievements worldwide.
The White Paper says that China's development is based on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development is based on a spirit of "800 million shirts for a Boeing" , in which generations have struggled and struggled, with hard work and sweat beyond the imagination of others; on a spirit of "self-burdened" responsibilities, whether in good or bad, not to export problems, not to resort to conflict, not to plundering other countries for their own development, or on a spirit of "spreading rocks across the river" exploration, not imperialism, colonialism, not following the Western model of development, but rather to incorporate Chinese reality, learning from human civilization, and dare to try and walk out of one's own path.
The White Paper states that China has developed in its interaction with the world, that China has injected positive energy into world peace and development, and that China ' s roads are adapted to China ' s national conditions and times.
China defends world peace with practical actions.
For 70 years, China has not initiated any war or conflict, nor has it invaded one inch of the land of another country.
The White Paper states that China has achieved great success in its development over the past 70 years, essentially because it has found the correct path of China's socialism and has followed that path unswervingly.
It is a path to be established in the national context, with people ' s interests at the forefront, reform and innovation, common development in openness and full adherence to the rule of law.
China is large, complex, difficult to govern in a world where there is no centralized unity, strong leadership, and China will move towards division and disintegration, bringing disaster to the world.
The White Paper says that, over the past 70 years, China has overcome risks and challenges and created yet another remarkable Chinese miracle.
In particular, since the 18th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, China has achieved historic achievements in its development and made historic changes, and the Chinese nation has embarked on a great leap from standing up and becoming rich to being strong, closer than ever before to the great goal of national renewal.
This path of development in China will show brighter prospects for development as the times move forward.

New regulations for consultation: Qualification of social capital for rural land ownership
Qualification of social capital for rural land ownership
A public consultation on the scheme for the management of rural land tenure to regulate the transfer of social capital flows, such as business enterprises, to land tenure
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website published a public call for comments on the " Rural Land Management Approach (Referendum of Comments) " (hereinafter referred to as " the Bill of Opinions " ), which increased the regulation and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital flows, such as business enterprises, to land ownership.
The draft of the opinion is now open to public opinion.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, in order to implement the newly revised Rural Land Contracting Act, to further consolidate and improve the basic rural business system, to deepen the reform of the rural land system and to implement the "triple-ownership" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has revised the "Rural Land Contracting and Transfer Management System" to produce a "commentation " .
The Beijing Youth Reporter learned that the first release of the "opinion" contained a number of important changes.
The newly revised Rural Land Contracting Act clarifies the scope of land transfers and introduces the concept of "triple power sharing", with separate sections on "contracting ownership of land" and "ownership of land", making a clear distinction between the transfer of land contracts, swaps and land transfers (rent, subcontracting, equity entry or other means).
In this draft of the Opinion, in order to implement the concept of "triple power-sharing", to respond effectively to the main thrust of the reform of the Rural Land Contracting Act and to take into account the fact that there are wide variations in the transfer of rights to land management and the transfer of rights to land contract management, in terms of parties, procedures, regulation, etc., the revised version defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on the transfer of rights to land management, including renting, equity, etc., and to change the name of the regulation from "the transfer of rights to rural land management" to "the transfer of rights to rural land management".
For the transfer of land contracting rights, there will be a separate regulatory regime for the swap.
According to the Draft Opinion, in the context of the "triple power sharing" farmers are only entitled to land ownership for a limited period of time.
Theoretically, even in the event of liquidation, farmers risk losing their right to operate for a certain period of time, and thus providing for the return of the place of contract to the original contractor is no longer legally necessary and is in conflict with the "insolvency law".
In response to farmers ' risk of land loss, priority shares have been created in practice, rent-backs, buy-backs, etc.
Taking into account that priority shares have developed a more advanced theoretical approach to corporate law, it is proposed to be used as an advocacy provision to protect against the risk of stock loss ...
