New issues in California Waterworks
Following the disclosure by Governor Jerry Brown of a major water management district in California that the administration would provide government funding to complete the planning of the two giant water tunnels, some commentators and a state councillor indicated that they would like to know more about who would bear the cost of the $16 billion water project supported by the Governor.
According to commentators, the government funds mentioned on Thursday in Los Angeles may be contrary to the State's long-standing commitment that, in order to realize Brown's vision of two 35-mile tunnel excavations to facilitate the flow of water from the Sacramento River to the south and to supply it primarily to the central and southern regions of California, the local watersheds (rather than California itself) will bear the costs.
The $248 million initial cost of these tunnels has been the subject of an ongoing federal audit without the approval of the regulatory authorities.
Some state councillors also ordered a state audit of tunnel expenses on Wednesday.
The spokesperson for the state, Nancy Vogel, stated on Thursday that although the account belonged to the Los Angeles City Watershed, it would not be possible to complete the current planning phase of the tunnels with any ordinary funds from the state.
However, the opposition to the tunnel project and a group of taxpayers criticized it on Thursday, and Susan Egman, a state congresswoman behind the audit order this week, asked the state government to clarify the situation on Thursday.
David Wolfe, Legislative Director, Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, said, "This is a scam."
I think, for yesterday's audit, there were far more questions than answers.
The tunnel project is supported by a number of politically influential water management areas and water users in Brown and in central and southern California.
Proponents say that these tunnels will benefit the environment and help California ensure a safer water supply.
Opponents, for their part, expressed concern that the state would divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the San Francisco Bay through these tunnels, thereby causing damage to northern California and thus threatening the survival of the species there.
The large city water management areas and other water management areas that are expected to fetch water from tunnels have yet to make a commitment to cover the costs, owing to uncertainty as to whether this huge expenditure will actually bring them enough water to reduce the price of water.
These water management areas also declared this year that they would not bear the cost of completing the current initial work until the project had been approved by the regulatory authorities.
On Thursday, the L.A. Water Management District issued a monthly report on the tunnel project: " The state has indicated that any additional funding required to complete the planning phase will be provided from state or federal sources ... "
The L.A. Water Supply Management District spokesperson Bob Muir said that, after all the local water management districts had invested in the project (including $63 million from his water management area), "it can be expected" the state would use government funds to help complete the planning phase.
He asked the state spokesman Vogel further questions.
Vogel indicated that the state intends to draw funds from user fees for the existing water network (i.e., state water works) that have been in use for half a century to complete planning for the tunnel project.
However, opponents of the tunnel project turned to a bill passed by the state councillors in 2009, which they said prohibited the state from investing in the tunnels unless the water services benefiting from it committed themselves to covering the costs of the tunnels.
Long-standing opponents of the proposed tunnel, Patricia Scheffer, environmental consultant, stated: " Project contractors, who promised to bear the cost of the project, have circumvented this obligation through financial tricks. "
So the question is where the money can be spent.
Corporate claims to China on Cybersecurity Law
A coalition of international conglomerates called on China to change the proposed cybersecurity rules and warned that they would undermine trade and isolate countries.
46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America co-signed a letter to Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, reflecting the level of global concern that Internet security rules may restrict or block access to Chinese markets for information security products.
The signatories include the American Chamber of Commerce, the European Forum on Services and various groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
China's proposed cybersecurity rules will require suppliers to demonstrate to the Chinese authorities how they work on safety products and to store information on Chinese citizens in China.
According to the latest letter issued on Wednesday, this may make the data more vulnerable to theft and may reduce access to Chinese clients.
Tianjin Chemical Bombing: One Anniversary of the Deadly Catastrophe
Zhang Manfan said the public should know what happened in Tianjin's bombing.
Chinese leaders may wish to commemorate in a silent manner the first anniversary of the chemical explosion that killed 173 people, but not everyone thinks so.
Please read John Sudworth's story from Tianjin.
If such a magnitude disaster occurs anywhere in the world, the anniversary will almost all be a national reflection.
Not in China.
While Jin City was holding a memorial service for those who had lost their firefighters on that day, the commemorations held elsewhere were being handled in a low-profile manner.
Communist-controlled media have been told what to say and what not to say, and some survivors and relatives of the deceased have been warned not to speak out.
However, 23-year-old Zhang Zhang won't keep his mouth shut.
"On this anniversary, there should be a way for the public to understand what happened," he told me.
I don't want to be silent.
Last August 12th, Mr. Zhang was a radio operator in the fire brigade belonging to the army, one kilometre from the blast centre.
He said, "The phone was called at 10:53 p.m., and then we started sending my teammates."
They need 10 minutes to get to the scene.
Firefighters from other parts of the city also arrived to cope with a fire in a chemical warehouse.
All of them may not be aware of the large amounts of volatile and toxic substances stored in the site in violation, which are far more than allowed and are not properly managed.
A shipment of nitroglycerin (a chemical device for nail polish) was allowed to dry and then ignited at high summer temperatures, causing a fire.
Then the fire spread to areas where there was a large stock (800 tons) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
The explosion that followed destroyed the fire station window and caused the roof to collapse, while Dreamfan was waiting for reports from the fire scene on the radio.
And those reports will never come back.
"When I saw the mushroom cloud, I fell into despair," he said to me.
I know what it means to my friends.
That night, his fire station sent 26 firefighters to the fire scene, eight of whom never returned.
Many of the surviving firefighters suffered severe burns and other injuries.
In two major explosions, the biggest one was observed as an earthquake, and the blast wave was still felt many kilometres away.
The total damage caused by the disaster was more than $1 billion, including more than 300 damaged buildings.
The total number of victims was 173, of whom 104 were firefighters.
The remains of eight of the victims were never found.
Official government investigations attribute responsibility to corruption, political relations and the collusion of officials, leading to laxity and disregard for the security system.
The warehouse shouldn't have been built that close to a residential building.
Over 100 officials and corporate executives are facing some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, while the Government can point to the progress made, such as the rehabilitation of thousands of homes and compensation for their inhabitants, there are still persistent sensitivities.
The disaster revealed a cleavage of a system in which rapid economic growth was prioritized and the lack of independent oversight was an indisputable fact.
The bravery and sense of responsibility that night could not be questioned, but the side of firefighters' image as heroes was another sad picture.
It's a picture of firefighters as victims who, without proper knowledge, were sent to a disaster that could have been avoided, man-made.
Zhang's leaving the fire department now, but will attend Tianjin's memorial service.
He will deliver a message to his fallen comrades.
What I wanted to tell them most was that I visited your parents, and they were fine.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm your family.
I'll do good for you.
Cold spring could affect the Scottish pine hunting season.
As the cold has reduced the number of pine chickens this year, the pine chicken hunting season in Scotland will be delayed.
Because many of the early chicks did not survive this cold spring, some estates have delayed hunting.
In an opening address for the pine chicken hunting season, the Scottish Hunting Field Carers Association stated that pine chicken hunting could sustain more jobs than major Edinburgh festivals.
But the animal protection charity OneKind called for an end to the "cruel killing" of these birds.
The director of the organization, Harry Hayden, said, " Maintaining the abundance of birds and birds in the hunting grounds for hunting requires a lot of work and always involves highly controversial practices. "
That is why the public is gradually taking a negative view of this so-called sport and calling on the government to view it as a cruel and unnecessary practice to please some very small Scots.
But the landowners insist that they're working to protect, and the hunting of pine chickens is vital to the rural economy.
According to Alex Hogue, President of the Scottish Orchestra Caregivers Association, the industry maintains 8,800 full-time jobs a year in remote areas and has become a "job-intensive belt" for some uncertain periods.
He said, "Scot does not have an innate `hunting' culture compared to many other European countries, and many people do not understand the economic impact of the hunting season on the country. "
According to Mr. Hogg, the number of full-time jobs dependent on hunting exceeds the sum of jobs created by the Edinburgh International Art Festival, the Edinburgh Art Festival, the Marginal Arts Festival, the Disaggregated Performing and the New Year's Eve Event.
He added: " Now that there are real concerns about employment in rural Scotland, particularly in the oil and gas sector, hunters and their families both want to see the industry grow ... "
We want to work with the Scottish government to ensure that hardworking people can continue to rely on these jobs in the future.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that eight golden eagles were illegally hunted around the pine chicken hunting grounds.
Many gamekeepers admit that pine chicken hunting is not generally popular, but the Scottish gamekeepers Association states that the industry has made "specified progress in best practices".
The opening day of the pine chicken hunting season is traditionally known as the "Small Twelve".
However, the recreational activity remains controversial, and the management of the pine hunting grounds has been labelled as persecuting the Raptor by some wildlife conservation organizations.
On Thursday, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds stated that in less than five years, eight gold eagles with tags were missing in the Monaria Mountains, south-east of Inverness City.
The wildlife charity believed that the statues had been illegally hunted around the pine chicken hunting grounds, while their satellite tracking tags had been destroyed.
The Scottish Minister of the Environment, Rosana Cunningham, said the reports were "very disturbing and disappointing".
Ms. Cunningham has instructed the relevant officials to analyse the signs of the survival and disappearance of some 90 labeled eagles to determine whether there is a pattern of suspicious activity.
The Scottish Hunting Fields Group accused the Royal Bird Protection Society of trying to raise anti-hunting emotions before the pine chicken hunting season and stated that there was no conclusive evidence that the Raptor had actually died in Monaria.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Bronnie Pecs took the money for Britain's trample.
British Paige won a silver medal in the trampoline project.
Brownie Pecchi Rio took silver and became the first British woman to win an Olympic trampoline medal.
At the age of 25, Paige's score was 0.425 below the gold medallion, while the Canadian winner, Rosanna MacLennan, was 56.465 for the Olympic Champions.
Chinese, world champion Li Dan took the medal, while another British player, Catherine Driscoll, won sixth place.
I can't believe I won the Olympic medal.
"I'm really happy."
I didn't think I'd get the medal, but I did my best, so I was happy, and all the training and hard work paid off.
I'm glad to be in the finals with Catherine, and if one of us goes to the finals, we make history, and we have two of us.
Before winning the Olympic silver medal, Paige won fifth place in the Danish World Championship in 2015.
The trampoline became the Olympic Games for the first time in 2000, and the Olympic Games are the first time that British women have entered the finals.
The response after winning the medal.
The British delegation's only male contestant for Saturday's men's trampoline project, Nathan Bailey, was so excited.
Hannah Vilan, a gymnast who participated in the two Olympic Games, did not hesitate to commend Paige for his achievements.
Paige has an honorary degree in biology at Sheffield University.
Rio Olympics 2016: Fiji fans celebrate the seven-person football gold medal
A 12-year-old boy ran past the sugar cane field and went to the nearest television station half a mile away to watch the game.
After Fiji won its first Olympic medal, the celebration was extraordinary.
The banks are closed, the shops are closed, the carnivals are occupying the streets of the capital Suva, dancing, singing and cheering.
In the seven-man football finals at Dodoro Stadium, Fiji defeated Britain by 43 to 7.
Thousands of people on the island have dropped their jobs and watched this historic game.
Fiji celebrates its first Olympic medal in history.
Many supporters wear coloured Fijian costumes and football suits to fuel the team with flags.
In the hour of the final whistle, the excitement of the crowd swung into the streets, cheering and cheering.
"Some even parked their cars on the busy streets of Suva and got out of the car with the Fiji flag to join the celebrations, ignoring the light traffic jams they caused... " The Fiji Times reported...
The celebration will last until the weekend and next week.
Irish Super Football Federation: Finn Harper 0-5 versus Delhi
Aaron McNefe got two dots for the team in the first half of Finn Park.
With a five-0 victory for the Finn Harpers, the Derry Towns ranked second in the league.
Two dotballs in more than half of Aaron McNev's game took the initiative of the Derry Towns, both of which were acquired by the fouling of Lucas Schubert.
Nathan Boyle won in the second half of the game shortly after Schubert got into the fourth ball, and then Keith Ward's late homing was cast to the collapse of Finn Park.
The Derrys are one point ahead of the Kirks, and they're going to play a battle on Monday night at Brandyville.
This is the first victory of the Derrys this season in the three games of the Northwestern Facers, and the underperforming Finn Harpers have caused them little trouble.
Although the foul appears to be outside the field, after Shalan Cole's foul of Schubert, McNeff entered the first ball in 17 minutes with great pain.
There's no doubt that the second strike was the fall of a former Derry mid-field player, Barry Molloy, so that McNiff would once again expand the score to 2-0 in three minutes after the first goal.
Eight minutes after the kickback, Boyle used a passback from Dean Jarvis to play it coolly.
Delley's goalkeeper, Gerald Doherty, spent a quiet night, but he also made a wonderful run for David Scalley's best shot in his home game.
In 83 minutes, Schubert swayed through Cole, and shortly afterward, Ward crossed a brilliantly high ball by Richard Bush.
This game was the biggest victory of the Derrys in the league, laying a solid foundation for the men and women of the Kirks.
Large-scale failure of the University of the Highlands and the Islands course at Inverness College.
Twenty students across the class may no longer be able to pass the High Media Examination administered by the Inverness College of the University of the Highlands and Islands.
The majority of students in this course are 17 and 18 years of age and wish to enter university on the basis of their achievements in their studies.
According to the Inverness College of the University of the Highlands and Islands, the school quality assurance process is functioning and the Scottish Education Management Board (SQA) is conducting a survey.
A spokesperson for the Scottish Education Management Board said that the national high-level media evaluation for 2016 was "on schedule".
The 20 students enrolled in this course, managed and scored by the Inverness College of the University of the Highlands and the Islands.
Many of these students are young people from rural areas, who are taught online, but are also required to travel from their place of residence (e.g. Lohab) to this college in Inverness.
The father of one of the students stated that after her daughter had posted her homework in social media without any credits, at least 10 other students had also come forward to indicate that they had not received any credits for their course homework.
He told the BBC News Network Scotland Online that about five other students who studied the same course at the Inverness College at the University of the Islands last year contacted them about the same thing.
This situation means that his daughter is unable to secure her admission to Glasgow University, but because she has acquired some qualifications during her studies, she will have access to the admission opportunities offered by another university.
But the girl's father said that the other students in the Academy's media programme were not so fortunate that they were now "suffering" and were not sure whether their courses would be re-examined and given a score sufficient to allow them to enter the university.
Inverness College is a University of the Highlands and Islands affiliate.
Diana Rawlingson, Dean and Chief Executive Officer of the Inverness College of the University of the Highlands and Islands, said: "We take students ' examination and academic achievements very seriously. "
The excellent HMIE report we received earlier this year and the progress we have made in continuing and higher education over the years are proof of this.
As we do every year, we are reviewing all published scores and comparing them with the expected scores for each student.
For this particular course, there is a regular quality assurance process in place, and the crediting authority recently reported "a significant advantage in the award and management of the credit" and confirmed that the evaluation judgement is in line with national standards".
At our request, the Scottish Education Management Board is currently investigating the matter.
A spokesperson for the Scottish Education Management Board said: " We are pleased that the 2016 high-level media assessment, as expected, provides candidates with the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the subject matter ... "
Many of the candidates are strong, and we see a slight improvement in A-C compliance from last year.
The examination was designed to be consistent with previous papers and sample papers, and to conform to our curriculum and evaluation criteria.
The brothers in the Kilmanok Sword Bleeding case were sentenced to prison.
Jason Braden was attacked with a sword, a dagger and a double cutter.
Two male suspects were imprisoned for drug-related robbery and subsequent "blood washing" in East Alshire, killing a male with a samurai knife.
The victim, Jason Braden, 38 years old, was repeatedly stabbed during an attack on his home in Kilmanok on 5 July 2015.
At Glasgow High Court, James Clark, 36 years old, charged with murder and sentenced to at least 22 years' imprisonment.
His brother John, 38 years old, was charged with lesser manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.
In sentencing the brothers to prison, Judge Bill Dunlop stated that they had carried out "a brutal, ruthless, brutal attack".
He refused to accept any argument that Mr. Braden had been waiting for them with a sword.
Judge Dunlop added: "You conspired to break in with at least one dagger and two sticks."
Although Jason Braden may be a drug dealer, he is also a son, a father and a friend.
And you killed him.
After the two men were sentenced to prison, Detective Inspector David Moran, who was in charge of the investigation, said: "The brutality of James Clark and John Clark led to the death of Jason Braden. "
It's heartbreaking to be killed at the age of 38 and in such appalling circumstances, while the families of the victims are forced to endure it.
According to statements previously heard by the court, the brothers from Kilmanok decided to take Mr. Braden's golden bracelet, which they had delivered to him in exchange for drugs.
After drinking and using drugs, they went to the victim's house, covered their faces with a scarf and held a dagger and a martial arts double-crosser.
The sword used to kill was believed to be the victim's belongings.
Neighbors said they could see the Clark brothers attacking Mr. Braden because Brandon was sitting on the couch next to the window and they could hear him screaming.
In his statement before the court, the prosecutor, Richard Goddard, said: "The victim was subjected to an ongoing, insane attack. "
Then the scene of the murder was described as a bloodbath.
In addition to the stab wounds, Mr. Braden suffered blunt force trauma during the attack.
Three days later, he died at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmanok.
Brothers deny murder.
At the time of the testimony, there were 38 previous convictions and one attempted murder, James Clark said, "I didn't intend to do this. It was an accident."
On 23 occasions, John Clark, a former criminal, stated that he had been involved only to help his brother, who claimed that he was being attacked by Mr. Braden.
Men die in prison for shaking their cubs.
David Sinclair confessed to killing his child in 2012 at his home in East Kilbreed.
The man who swayed in anger and killed his youngest child because he could not feed him was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.
On December 6, 2012, at his home in East Kilbreed, South Ranak County, David Sinclair rocked Joshua only four months old in a state of "out of control".
The cause of death was discovered after the medical expert's case evaluation.
34-year-old Sinclair was initially charged with murder, but pleaded guilty and sentenced to manslaughter.
When he was sentenced to prison by the Glasgow High Court, Judge Lord Brackerdale said to Sinclair, "You attacked him through your son, who was in the middle of a violent shaking, causing him fatal injuries. "
You must have known you were shaking him, but you didn't tell him.
It's only after a lot of medical research that you admit to what you did.
Your wife trusts you.
Now she feels misled by you and can't support you anymore.
Lord Bruckdale said that Joshua's death had had a "wrong" effect on all concerned and added, "Nothing will bring Joshua back to life."
The court had previously learned that Sinclair and his wife, Christie, had taken Joshua for a swim the day of the child's death, and then went shopping in East Kilblad.
At 17:30, Christy Sinclair went out to see her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later, she got a call from Sinclair, and his voice sounded "shocked."
And he said to her, "Joshua's not breathing well. Come home now."
Then he hung up and called 999.
The baby was taken urgently to Hermes Hospital, where it died.
At first, Joshua's cause of death was not established, but the medical team reviewed the case and found evidence that the eye and brain had traumas caused by non-accidental events as they approached the time of death.
According to a member of the Group, Dr. Peter Richards, consultant to paediatric neurosurgeons at the Oxford Radcliffe Hospital, " This evidence shows that the baby has suffered more severe shaking than normal force used in everyday life. "
Counselor, Royal Legal Counsel Ian Dougett said to the court that Sinclair was "extremely sorry" for what he did.
Rio Olympics 2016: Chloe Tarton seems to question Yulia Yefimova
The English player Tarton missed a 200-metre frog swimmer.
When the Russians were ahead of her in the 200-metre frog swim project, the British player Chloe Tarton seemed to question the appearance of the controversial swimmer Yulia Yefimova at the Rio Olympics.
Yefimova was allowed to compete and take the silver medals after an appeal against a doping ban, and Tarton won fourth.
Then the 20-year-old swimmer from Wales said, "I'd rather it be a clean game."
I can't help but wonder who's on the field.
I'm not happy, but that's the way it is.
Yafimova, the military's winner, still doesn't know if he's allowed to compete three days ago.
I don't want to see anyone being denied access to the campaign, but I don't think it's the right thing to do.
She's not supposed to be in the game, and a 20-year-old English player deserves a medal.
KIMTO-Lihi defeated Yafimova and won the seventh gold medal for the 2016 Rio Olympics for the Japanese team.
Chinese player Scorpion won the copper, only 0.06 seconds ahead of Tarton in fourth place.
Tarton's other British team mate, 20-year-old Molly Lenshaw, won sixth place.
Totton added: "It's a little frustrating to get a fourth in front of anyone. "
It was a great experience, and I was a little disappointed in my fourth grade.
I missed the medal, it was a dream.
But entering the finals is a great experience, and I'll be encouraged by it for years to come.
It's a little frustrating, but it'll make me stronger in the future, and it makes me more eager to win the medal, hoping that next time I'll be closer to the medal.
Tutton's only got 0.01 seconds of British records in the 200-metre frog final.
"Everyone deserves a second chance." - Yefimova.
Yefimova said he was tired of answering questions about her past on doping and defending her right to participate in the Rio Olympics.
She was banned for 16 months in 2013 because she found traces of synthetic metabolic steroids in her body.
The International Sports Arbitration Tribunal (CAS) provided that athletes who had previously been sanctioned could not be banned from participating in the Rio Games.
The International Sports Arbitration Court heard my appeal, and I won.
She explained: "If someone doesn't like it and disagrees, they can go to the International Sports Arbitration Tribunal and express it. "
I don't support the use of stimulants, and I've never used them.
The latter is not my fault at all.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
When you drive and get a ticket, no one will put you in jail.
Ben Praudd's 50-meter free swim finals.
Earlier, Ben Praudd was promoted to the 50-metre free swim finals to break the British record.
21-year-old Commonwealth Games champion Plaud swam for 21.54 seconds to be ranked fifth for the Friday final.
Your delegation is rude and rude.
Indian Sports Minister Vijay Gore was prominent at the Rio Olympics, often appeared on the stand to fuel Indian athletes and filmed himself after the game.
However, according to the Indian Press Trust, he and many of his followers had apparently provoked the anger of Olympic officials, who had attempted to break into the area without showing proper evidence and had been examined in rude language.
Vijay Gore justified his actions.
On Wednesday, after Gore and his men tried to break into the restricted areas of gymnasium and sword and taekwondo, Olympic organizers wrote warning that Gore would be disqualified if he made no further improvements.
In his 2016 letter, Sarah Peterson, the continental manager of the Rio Organizing Committee, wrote: "We have received numerous reports that your Minister of Sport has attempted to enter the area of the stadium with unauthorized persons who require authorized access. "
Staff members reported that when they tried to explain that the situation was not allowed, the Minister ' s line became aggressive and rude and repeatedly pushed staff members to break in.
The letter goes on to say: "If our ceremonial team is again informed of such acts, your Minister of Sports will be disqualified and his privileges at the Olympic Games removed. "
The head of the Indian delegation called it a "problem, but it's not a problem" and Gore himself said he didn't do anything wrong and attributed it to a misunderstanding.
On Twitter, he said, "As far as I know, we've always followed all the rules and regulations. "
We are committed to the Olympic spirit and support our Indian players.
Otherwise, it would be a frustrating Olympic Games for India, with no medal yet.
Disappointing fans in social media say that Michael Phelps has now won 26 medals, as much as the total number of medals in India's history.
Several famous contestants have been eliminated, including the shooter Abinaf Bingdra, who won the gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
He won fourth place at the Olympics.
The writer and columnist, Shoha De, tweets: "What a waste of money and opportunity."
But as the contestants fight for silver in boxing, golf, tennis, track and, of course, badminton, there's still some bright hope.
Indian female gymnasts alone, Deepa Kamaka, will go to the horse finals on Sunday, flaunting her awesome two-week "Death Jump" and other athletes rarely try to do this piva dance.
For a country with a population of 1.25 billion, the low number of medals in India is always surprising.
Analysts say there are many reasons for this.
India's sports program is cricket, but cricket is not an Olympic project.
India has not invested much in the infrastructure and training of Olympic athletes, and the first equipment used by Kamaka was made from parts of an old motorcycle.
Parents have traditionally focused more on schooling than on sports.
And the sports administration has been plagued by corruption.
In 2012, the Indian Olympic Association elected a leader with criminal charges, contrary to the IOC statute, and the IOC suspended the Association.
At the Sochi Winter Olympics, three Indian players were not even allowed to represent their country, with flags and badges.
They can only attend the Winter Olympics as independent athletes.
Jet blue flight from Boston to Sacramento landed in South Dakota as a result of casualties.
In Sacramento, the Colombian Broadcasting Corporation reported that on Thursday night, a Jell-Blue flight was hit by a turbulence that injured 22 passengers and two crew members and was forced to make an emergency landing.
Flight 429 from Boston to Sacramento landed in Rapid City, South Dakota, near 7:30 p.m. local time.
According to the flight, the wounded were taken to a hospital for examination.
Jell-Blue Airlines indicated that it had seconded personnel to assist the wounded and that an alternative aircraft had flown to Rapid City to take the rest of the passengers to Sacramento.
The DEA missed the opportunity to release the banned medical marijuana.
The answer is sad: it's not possible.
It's a missed opportunity that could further delay the potential treatment required by millions of people.
As of today, there is only one source of research-level medical cannabis approved by the Federal Government at the University of Mississippi.
There's a seemingly positive news today, and the DEA has announced that it will now allow others to apply for approval.
Hopefully, the amount and variety of cannabis used for scientific research could expand.
While this will be hailed as a victory in the field of research, it is largely symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, it makes little sense if it is still difficult to access.
Imagine a product that is locked behind a door despite a great deal of demand.
In response to the demand for this product, someone made an inexplicable decision to make more products without opening the locked door.
It's the product, and it's designated as a controlled substance. It's the locked door.
That's the problem with medical marijuana.
Since cannabis is a controlled substance (meaning that it has "no recognized medical purpose at present and has a high potential for abuse") there are important obstacles that need to be overcome in order to open the door.
Researchers who may be in need are usually the first to go to the DEA because the department is required to grant permission to start scientific research.
Even after a licence has been granted, in order to study a controlled substance, research institutes must install heavy safes and advanced security systems, which require considerable expense.
There is also a more subjective consideration that the study of a controlled substance should first be carried out with the approval of your academic institution.
Even if individual teachers want to undertake such research, the university leadership may not want to cause trouble or potential impact as a result of negative reporting.
That was the case at Arizona University when Dr. Su Heathley was dismissed after seeking a medical marijuana test.
Heathley ended up having to seek private funding for its project, and in April, seven years after the original design of the research project, her pilot project became the first medical cannabis experiment approved by the DEA to study post-traumatic stress disorder treatment for veterans.
Then, after years of institutional obstacles, the National Drug Abuse Institute of the United States obtained the last key to unlocking the lock.
Today, it is the largest federal public fund for cannabis research and the only supplier of cannabis itself.
Even if more medical marijuana were liberated for research now, the agency would have to approve any research it funded.
But the problem is the last word in his name: "abuse."
When I interviewed Donald Abernathy of the University of San Francisco for the documentary "Weed", he said that one of the main functions of the Institute was to study potential substance abuse rather than to study it as a drug.
Abernathy.
Even if a research client takes on all of the above-mentioned obstacles, the barrier may not be open as long as its purpose is not to harm but to benefit from the medical use of cannabis.
Think about it: a quick search of the U.S. National Medical Library, which is certainly not scientific, shows that there have been 1,434 medical marijuana-related papers in the last five years.
The results of that search also revealed that there were only 57 papers on the benefits of medical marijuana.
Most papers study the harmful effects of cannabis, such as "the bad experience of the neurotransmission of cannabis" , "the incubation of pancreas" and "the use of cannabis and the risk of lung cancer".
This imbalance reflects a highly distorted picture.
The path to medical marijuana research is paved by surprises and hypocrisy everywhere.
While the DEA continues to maintain a classification of a type of controlled substance and sees no medical interest whatsoever, the US Department of Health and Human Services holds a patent on a wide range of medicinal uses of cannabis.
The DEA continues to list cannabis with heroin and ecstasy as a substance with high potential for abuse, although Francis Young, the former chief executive judge of the DEA, does not accept this.
Under strict medical conditions, marijuana is much safer than much of our daily food.
For example, 10 potatoes can cause toxic effects.
In contrast, in terms of human physical condition, it is impossible to eat enough marijuana to kill.
Natural forms of marijuana are one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to humans.
According to any rational analysis, cannabis can be used safely within the normal procedures of supervised medical care.
Again, this is the opinion of one of the DEA's own judges.
Yet almost 30 years have passed, almost nothing has changed.
Whether we are aware of this or not, we accept a certain degree of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the power to admit it, or we're so silent and grumpy that we don't seem to get noticed.
But for the hypocrisy of the federal policy on cannabis for medical purposes, it's worth the courage to remain true.
The patient's life depends on it, for example, Charlotte Figi, who needs medical marijuana to relieve epilepsy, and a lot of other patients.
There's a plant that offers so much benefit but is still locked behind these locked doors, and it's worth talking about.
Bloody beet root: Donald Trump is the blonde Berlusconi.
The blood beet roots are known for their electronic dances.
These musicians say Trump has the same media dominance as Berlusconi.
The founder of the electronic dance punks' bloody beet root said to CNN, "You know, Italy was once in power in Berlusconi. To me, Trump was like Berlusconi with golden hair."
The Republican presidential candidate and the Italian media tyrannical politician are well known for their superior personalities, their skills in attracting media attention and their ability to tell stories in the media.
Like the bloody beet root, River was famous for his electronic dance, and in 2013 he worked with artists, including the legendary Sir Paul McCartney and the electronic pop singer Greta Swaber Beecher, to create the song "The History of Declined Love".
Rifford was born in 1977 in Bassano, a small town outside Venice, Italy, and punk rock music was born about that time, and the musician tattooed the number "1977" on his chest.
River with his symbolic black mask says, "English is not my mother tongue, so I don't know anything about your country."
I've tried to explore, and I've been trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifford has invited Americans to watch TV politics, a documentary about Berlusconi's monopoly on the Italian media.
River said that the documentary described "how Berlusconi made Italy mad" and added that Trump had a similar effect on the United States.
He said, "You can see how a man can turn his back and twist everything and do whatever he wants."
To me, Trump is not a good thing for this country.
Two Turkish sailors were arrested for smuggling £500 million of drugs in an anti-drug operation.
Two Turkish men accused of smuggling £500 million worth of cocaine by boat in the North Sea were sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Following the discovery of 3 tons of Class A drugs on the merchant ship Hamar, some 100 miles off the Aberdeen coast, Mumin Shahin and Amin Ozman were found guilty in the High Court trial in Glasgow.
According to the information received, this anti-drug operation in 2015 found the largest single case of cocaine shipments by sea ever discovered in Europe.
Momin Shahin and Emine Ozman were arrested for involvement in a huge drug trade.
The amount of drugs seized on board is one of the biggest drug cases in British history.
The ship used to carry the drugs was registered as a tugboat in Tanzania, with a route from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea, where the drugs were hidden in specially modified hidden cabins.
The smuggling vessel was intercepted by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Somerset and the border guard armed boat HMC Valiant.
The Glasgow High Court sentenced Shahin, 47, to 22 years' imprisonment and Ozman, 51, to 20 years' imprisonment.
Judge Lord Kincraven told the two criminals that the quantity of drugs was "not much larger" and that drug trafficking had a "destructive effect" on the public and society alike.
The judge stated: " You used a ship to traffic in cocaine across borders, and in fact across continents, committing one of the most serious crimes of a commercial scale. "
The judge told Captain Shahin that he was "not at the top of the drug-trafficking tree structure" but played an important role in the crime, while Deputy Captain Ozman played a "slightly" role.
The officials on board the Hamar received a tip from the French National Customs Intelligence Agency, which, after docking at Aberdeen, found a hidden cabin through a steel plate, found 128 bags of cocaine weighing 3.2 tons, estimated to be worth about £512 million in the street black market.
The Royal Navy boarded the Humal last year.
There's three tons of cocaine on board.
At the time of the raid, the ship's ballast tank was filled with tons of Class A drugs.
The ship was stopped in the North Sea on its way from Bosphorus to South America.
The entrance to the hidden space was found under the closet of a crew dorm, where the opening was blocked by cement.
Shahin and Ozman were found guilty of carrying and concealing cocaine on board the ship between 20 February and 23 April last year and of suspected cocaine trafficking between 21 April and 23 April.
These two have been in the shipping industry since the end of their studies, both first-time offenders, who have accepted the verdict of the jury and still maintain their innocence.
The charges against four other men were ultimately found to be unsubstantiated.
Shashin's lawyer, Jonathan Crowe, said that the married father with two children on his knees was a "honoured mule."
He said, "Someone's involved in the transportation of drugs."
A man who can command the ship.
As far as the hierarchy of drug dealers is concerned, Mr. Shahin is certainly not at the top of the drug-trafficking tree structure, but at the lower level.
The absolute amount of cocaine loaded on board means they have to be carried by cranes.
Before the drugs were packed into these boxes, the police took days to examine the ship in detail.
At the court hearing, it was learned that Shahin was nominated in February 2015 as the captain of the Hammar tugboat.
Mr. Crowe said that Shahin was so sad to miss the important stages of her 9-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son's growth, and that he wanted to go home in Turkey.
Since their detention in April 2015, the two men have not seen their families, who are running for visas.
Ozman's lawyer, Di Moore, said that Ozman was "extremely eager" to meet his family, but it was clear that this was still a "sweetness" for the foreseeable future.
Speaking after today ' s sentencing, the Acting Crown Prosecutor of Scotland, David Harvey, stated: " The international drug trade knows no boundaries... and, in keeping with our vocation to abolish the drug trade, we are working closely to ensure its dominance. "
" Scotland ' s pursuit of criminals is truly global in scope, and in this case we have given a major economic blow to organized crime ... "
Every cabin on this ship contains drugs, including space below deck.
This bag of contraband was found hidden in the boat's laundry room by the inspector.
Mr. Harvey added: " The case of the tugboat Hamar was solved on the basis of secret reports provided by the French authorities and the prompt cooperation of the Tanzanian Attorney-General, the place of registration of the vessel, made it possible to board and inspect it. "
" We obtained vital shipping records in Guyana, and then our investigation extended from Guyana to Spain, where we learned of the important information about the ship ' s parking in the Canary Islands ... "
We also work with our Danish, Norwegian and American counterparts to combine specific elements of evidence.
Despite reliable information that the Hamar is carrying large quantities of drugs, the British authorities cannot board and inspect ships in international waters without the permission of the Tanzanian Government, which has never done so before.
According to Su Patten, head of the International Justice and Organized Crime Department of the Crown Prosecution Service of Scotland: " The criminal justice advisers accredited to Tanzania by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office have acted quickly and precisely, obtaining approval from the relevant Tanzanian authorities to board and inspect the ship within 24 hours of receiving the information. "
Under international maritime law, the United Kingdom cannot board and inspect foreign-flagged vessels in international waters unless it is permitted to do so by specific law ...
We would not have been able to bring these people to justice if it had not been for the swift action of our criminal justice advisers and the likelihood that the ship would have escaped.
Photographer Brian Lauman's corrupted Eastern Express.
These are photographs of an abandoned train taken in Belgium by the photographer Brian Laumen, currently living in Rotterdam.
Photos show the train's rusty appearance, broken seats, dusty windows and a small room for pilots.
It's called the Eastern Express, but it's a Belgian national operator.
A city explorer took these remarkable pictures, which are the rotting remains of a bus that used to travel in one of the best ways.
Their glorious days have gone by, leaving the cars and locomotives below to rot in the railway station, and this has become a place of interest for photographers and explorers.
The 40-year-old photographer in Rotterdam, Brian Laumen, took these weird pictures, showing rusty faces of abandoned trains, broken seats, dusty windows and floors, and a small room for pilots.
Trains and locomotives abandoned in a Belgian railway station, but attracted city explorers.
From 1883 to 2009, when they operated in their legendary name, those trains used to be a luxury symbol.
This bike was used by the Belgian National Railways about 50 years ago.
After 126 years of running on the railway, the last train service, named the East Express, ended a glorious history in December 2009 when it sailed from Strasbourg to Vienna.
The Orient Express, which operates between Paris and Istanbul, is famous.
In 1883, when IBC started running the train line, it was called the East Express.
In 1891, it was called the East Express, and in the 1930s, it began to operate regularly across Europe.
Don't confuse it with the privately operated Venice Simplen East Express.
The number of luxurious cars in the world's still alive is extremely small.
This picture shows that the equipment in the small pilot's room is rusty, the meters are not removed and the wire is naked.
Lauman said, "It's a little claustrophobic, and the engine must be very loud."
These abandoned bikes and cars have become a popular attraction for photographers and explorers.
After Belgium visited these forgotten trains, Laumen said to the Daily Post Network Travel Channel, "I can really feel the view of the train being used during the full season."
On the journey, a gentleman with a high hat and a beautiful lady in a dress.
The makeup artist, Caitlin Garowe, is Buster Blass in the "deficient."
The Texas Caitlin Garowe attracted a lot of YouTube fans with her impressive makeup skills, commentary and shape change.
However, her latest role transformation, becoming Buster Blass in Development Impediments, seems to be quite incredible from anyone's standards.
In a three-minute video uploaded to her "Kiki G" YouTube channel, Ms. Galloway slowly and methodically turned herself into that hookmaker's unlucky character.
At the end of the video clip, she even used some music from the play to create a brilliant but strange atmosphere.
At the beginning of the video, this genius makeup artist shows her regular blonde, female self.
And then, with the clever use of time-lapse photography, she slowly turned into a bald mother's "good boy" with glasses.
Ms. Garowe made this transformation through such means as colored contact lenses, picturing around her nose and eyes, and drawing Buster's face on her head.
A clever way: she slowly turned into Tony Hale's Buster Blass through the clever use of time-delayed photography.
In the video shoot, she also imitates the character and habits of that highly admired TV character, with the most amazingly tight chin.
The video, shared on YouTube, has been viewed over 45,000 times, and netizens have praised the skills of the make-up artist:
"You're very gifted," a netizensman wrote under Ms. Garowe's post.
During the video shoot, she also mimics the character and habits of that crazy TV character.
"In doing these things, you can get into the role, and I like it very much," added another netizens.
The owner, Caitlin Garowe, who had become a role in Parks and Rogues, Ron Swanson, had also succeeded in viral marketing.
She said to her followers on YouTube that she wanted to be able to shape a makeup change every week in the near future.

Lancayshire's father was banned from his children's school because he was wearing a dirty T-shirt.
A father with two children on his knees was barred from attending his children's school because he was wearing offensive sweatshirts on his children's sports day.
Craig Macbeth, 36 years old, lived in Bernley, Lancayshire, and he said he put on the shirt with the slogan "Let's get out there and t**t it".
However, although he realized that he had made a mistake and then turned on the T-shirt and apologized, the next day he found himself banned from entering the school premises.
The single father was a four-year school director at the Park Primary School in Cohen, Bernley, and because of this ban, he was unable to pick up his children, the school staff even called social services and the police.
Craig Macbeth, a 36-year-old resident in Bernley, says he's been banned from school since the day of his child's sports with this offensive T-shirt.
Mr. Macbeth accused Principal Sarah Mickey of overreacting.
He said he was being unjustly punished for rushing to watch the two children's game and wearing the T-shirt.
The father has now resigned from the school board, and he says, "It's a mistake, it's my own negligence."
When I put on that dress, I didn't think it was a sports day.
At the end of the day, we had a father's race, and the headmaster noticed my T-shirt and said it wasn't right.
I apologized for wearing that dress the other way and thought it was over.
However, the 36-year-old father indicated that he had received an e-mail from the school director that evening asking him to interview the headmaster the following day, but he did not think it was necessary because he had already apologized.
Mr. Macbeth added: "The principal then called me and said I was forbidden to enter the school premises. "
I found out that after the day, some parents went on Facebook and made some very surprising comments about the matter, which caused a lot of attention.
Any reasonable person would think it was an overreaction.
Mr. Macbeth, editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said he believed that because of the ban he could not even pick up his children on the last day of the semester.
However, this prompted schools and social services to call.
The hit T-shirt had a picture of a Craig Charles character named Lester from the popular BBC comedy "Red Dwarf Star" with a slogan "Let's go out and t**t it".
He said, "I told them I couldn't go because they banned me from school."
Then I got a call from social services asking why I didn't pick up my daughter.
The school also called the police because I haven't picked up my daughter since almost 40 minutes have passed.
Mr. Macbeth claims that he was informed that he was no longer allowed to enter school premises and that the ban remained in force until further notice.
He said he was also warned that if he was found trespassing, he could face a fine of £500.
The headmaster of park primary school, Sarah Mickey, says it's over.
"I can confirm that Mr. Macbeth has resigned and is no longer a director of this school."
It's over. I'm looking forward to getting back to normal school in September.
Councillor Joe Cooney of Bernley said the school had clear policies and guidelines.
He said, "We all have to remember that when you take on a role like a senator or a school director, it means you have to discipline yourself with a higher standard... Unfortunately, he failed to meet that standard this time."
Congressman Jonathan Nixon added that he didn't think the school would ban him from entering, and the situation was exaggerated.
Nixon added: "He was stupid in that T-shirt, and he apologized. "
Lancayshire police confirmed that they had received a call from the school but were not present.
Sixty-five percent of Venezuelans want Maduro. The question is whether they're willing to fight for it.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans want President Nicolas Maduro removed, but the question seems to be whether they want to fight for it.
The day after the National Election Commission announced that there was no time for a recall vote this year (and thus guaranteed Chávezist control until 2019), the people of Caracas did as they always did, as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I was watching the Olympics and watching Michael Phelps put two more medals in his bag."
Altamila Square, located in the eastern part of Caracas, was a rallying point in early 2014 in protest against the Maduro regime.
Now, however, when more pressure is needed from the opposition than ever before to bring about a referendum this year, not all the people of the country show the same enthusiasm.
Dejan said, "I want a referendum, but I won't protest for security."
Other wiser people are willing to mobilize in the future, but admit that Venezuelans are not motivated enough.
The comments of the Chairman of the Electoral Commission, Tibice Lucena, attest to the fact that the Government is obstructing the process of recall.
Robert Torrès, age 60, told Fox Latin News, "I'll come to the protest if the opposition calls, but I know some of my friends are scared."
So, in addition to the many obstacles put forward by the government to delay the referendum, the opposition now faces another challenge: to mobilize people to protest on the streets.
Until recently, there was considerable support for the referendum initiative, and the number of people mobilized during the signature collection phase reached unprecedented proportions.
However, when protesting the Government's manoeuvres to block this effort, the crowd appeared to be very small.
Opposing Member of Parliament, Sipriano Eredia, said: " Some are focused on making food, while others are afraid of the many arrests and deaths that took place in 2014. "
After Lucena announced that the next step in the referendum process (i.e. the collection of additional signatures throughout the country) would have to wait until October, those who opposed the socialist government in the country claimed that President Maduro and his followers were trying to silence the will of Venezuelans and convince them that it was almost impossible to hold a vote this year.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum were to be held in 2017, Maduro might be forced to leave, but he would be allowed to appoint a successor.
But if he's fired this year, he'll have to call for a general election.
The United States Department of State referred to this issue in a statement on Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure that the Venezuelan people exercise their constitutional rights.
The statement states: " The remaining steps to achieve the presidential recall referendum need to be clear, concrete and implemented without delay, thus contributing to the speedy and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social problems in Venezuela ... "
According to Luis Salamanca, a political analyst who was a member of the Electoral Commission from 2006 to 2009, change could not take place soon.
He told Fox Latin News, "I don't think there will be a referendum this year unless there is a much larger social unrest and protest."
In his view, Lucena and the Government were undermining the law, but as long as the people did not protest sufficiently strongly, they might eventually achieve their purpose.
The opposition has called for a rally in Caracas on 1 September to speed up the process so that a recall vote can be held this year.
On that day, we wanted people from all over the country to come to the capital city and mobilize.
"The government will feel the pressure," says Eledia.
But Salamanca doesn't think the situation can wait that long.
The expert told Fox Latin News: "They should respond more quickly and strongly to Lucena ' s announcement, which effectively eliminated the referendum. "
Congressman Eledia acknowledges that some parties within the opposition are anxious to facilitate the rally as soon as possible, but others want more time to organize.
Now the opposition must be careful.
Salamanca stated: " If people are discouraged by the situation, there is a risk that the number of participants in the second round of signatures will be reduced. "
The referendum process must be supported by 20 per cent of the country's electorate, or nearly 4 million people, in order to be effectively activated.
Salamanca and other analysts believe that even if the recall took place in 2017, Chávezism would be frustrated.
Some, however, are less optimistic.
Our party wants political change this year.
Eledia told Fox Latin News: "If the government shuts down this election path, we'll have to explore other legitimate options. "
The British Super League, 2016-17, pre-appraisal 19: Sibromovich.
The Guardian's forecast ranks 14th (note: this is not necessarily Alan Smith's projection, but is the view of most of the journalists in this newspaper)
Last season ranked 14th.
The odds of winning a league championship (by Oddschecker statistics) are 1,000-1.
New season, the usual, until last week, the Sibrovićs looked the same: the 2016-17 season could be another comfortable or stalled season, led by a traditionally pragmatic Tony Presley, depending on the degree of modesty.
However, with Jeremy Piss selling 88% of his shares in the club to Pliss, known as Le Chi and Safe Hand, the team immediately became the company's favorite in an unwelcome market such as the one where the boss is often fired.
There has been a definite change in the situation in the Black Village, not only in the Hills Field, but also a few miles northwest of Woolf Hampton, where the New Easters from China unhesitatingly removed Kenny Jackiet from their posts.
Mr. Laird's concerns were dispelled, and the entrepreneur stated that he wanted to maintain the club's culture.
When he took over the club, Mr. Ryan said, "I don't want to change the quality of the club, nor to make unsustainable waste."
I want to be a good host and make a long-term investment in this club.
First of all, our goal is to make sure that we remain in the British Super League, and then, on that basis, I want the club to be in the top half of the team.
I believe this is the best football league in the world, and I want to lead this club as far as possible.
According to Preston's records, the first aspect should not be a problem.
The next goal is to be in the top half of the ranking, but for the new boss and the increasingly divided fans who want to move up the fast, it is important to realize that this is also an increasingly demanding task, as other teams in the middle are also catching up recently.
Over half the team, based on the final scores of 14th in the last season, must have paid more attention than the gradual rise in the ranking.
Only the Astonvila team scored fewer goals than they did, and it's worth mentioning that, during Christmas, the Sibrović team shot less than once in an average of 90 minutes, once the worst in the area.
They didn't score in 13 out of 38 and scored more than one in nine.
They didn't get over a ball in one of the 10 winning games, and seven won at 1-0.
As expected, out of a total of 34 rare pine balls, more than a dozen of them came from the locator ball.
No wonder there's a lot of disgruntled reactions on the field, probably the most striking of which was the bad play with Astonville at the end of January, which looked even worse.
On the other hand, only the first six teams have a better defense record, but none of the other clubs can claim to keep four middlebacks on a regular basis.
Guards are often underestimated, especially Johnny Evans, who was allegedly invited by the Arsenal Club after the recent casualty crisis.
The Northern Ireland foot was good at the European championship, and the Fessy Bromovich Club wouldn't let go without a huge call.
Ben Foster's goal is good. They're in the middle field.
It's very similar to Evans, and Darren Fletcher has a lot of evidence that he's still at 32 years old, and Claudio Jacob is underestimated.
It's disturbing to all that the long and twisted story of the future of Seydo Bellasino is still not over.
When Piston presided over the club, both Stock City and Crystal Palace offers were rejected against Mark Hughes, although Stokes remained enthusiastic, while Mark Hughes was patiently waiting.
After the end of the last season, all the parties involved should have taken action.
There's no doubt that the vanguard is talented, and as Presley has mentioned many times, we're all fighting for him, but it's been made clear that he can't be reached by a relationship alone.
The West Bromovich Club insisted on signing the next replacement to free the former English footman, who was under 21 years old, but their plan to invite Diafra Sacoga was stalled a few days before the transfer, stating that he had passed a medical examination and that everything was in order, but that he had a wound to his back, which meant he would miss the start of the season.
This put a lot of pressure on Venezuelan player Solomon Longton, who had some brilliant performance last season, but needed to build on the nine goals, especially in the context of Ricky Lambert's continuing poor state of mind.
In retrospect, the decision to release Victor Anicebe and Stefan Sesenhoon was a bit weird.
The slowness with which Pelis started his career as a young player is notorious, and it is unlikely that the three young players who entered his field of view in the last one-to-one game last season (Jonason Lecco, Sam Field and Taylor Roberts) will become normal.
He's going back to the guys who've been tested and tested, but Lecco does deserve attention.
The 17-year-old assault guard came out five times in the last season, and he was the first ever born in 1999 in the British Super League, and was highly valued in the British youth team.
Matt Phillips, signed from the Queen's Park Tourist Football Club with a $5.5 million commission, will bring speed. He's the only new player to enter the opening of the weekend tournament.
There's reason to believe that this could be a very busy transition window ending.
When it comes to what needs to be done, Price tells the Star Express, "We need it everywhere."
Every place you see.
Back game players, middle game players and front game players, we're all gonna have to strengthen.
Target's been set. We know what we want.
The facts show that obtaining them is more difficult than expected, mainly because of the uncertainty surrounding the transfer process.
This season can be judged by their opening performance, and from mid-October they're going to run seven competitions in the cities of Manchester, Liverpool, Tottenham and Lest.
By that time, the pressure on Preston will either be released or become more difficult.
Besides, even Bellasino might find a new club. Who knows!
The trustee supports pension reform, and the Tata Steel British aid agreement is about to be reached.
The pension trustee behind Tata Steel UK stated that the scheme could be reorganized and would not enter the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of the company entering into an aid agreement.
The UK Iron and Steel Pension Scheme debt of £15 billion, with a fiscal deficit of £700 million measured by some indicators, is a serious obstacle to reaching an aid agreement between Tower Steel Britain and the Talbert Port Steel Plant in Wales.
After several meetings with the Secretary of Commerce and the Superintendency of Pensions, Tata Steel has become more confident in ensuring the future of its British business.
The company plans to merge its European operations, including British companies, with the German enterprise group Tyson Krupp.
However, the condition of the aid agreement is that the British steel pension scheme needs to be restructured and the government needs to provide financial support.
Alan Johnston, Chairman of the Pension Trustee, said that if the interests of workers were revised, the scheme would avoid falling into pension protection funds.
Although the programme is well funded compared to other programmes, with a deficit of £300 million on some targets, the Tata Steel and Tisonkchuber Group are keen to bring debt under control.
Johnston says the trustee admits that it would be "unreal" for any buyer of the joint venture or the Tower Steel British to bear the costs of the current and future deficits.
He added that the modification of the planned welfare arrangements was a more attractive option than the inclusion of pension protection funds, as pension protection funds reduced the treatment of workers.
Tata Steel sources warned that the company could still sell the Talbot Port plant.
Since the start of negotiations in March on the future arrangements for its British company, the company has refused to provide guarantees for the future of the steel mills, which have been used as bargaining chips with the British Government.
The executive director of Tata Steel Europe, Kushko Chatterjee, stated that the Indian consortium wanted to make its steel business "more sustainable".
Chatterjee, speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of Tata Steel in India, said that negotiations on a reorganization of the pension scheme were progressing, but he insisted that the scheme was well funded ...
According to the Indian Times, Chatterjee said: "We are discussing with various stakeholders, including the British Government and others such as the Welsh Government ... "
There's a consensus that pensions have an impact on commodity businesses like steel, so we have to find a structural solution that does not affect the further development of businesses.
The pension trustee agreed to cooperate in the negotiations on the reorganization of the programme, which will be welcomed by the Tower Steel.
Possible changes to the programme include measuring annual inflation-related increases in benefits through the retail price index up to a lower consumer price index and limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law.
Johnston added: " The trustee and his advisers are tata steel, and the Government and the pension regulator provide strong evidence that the program is able to pay the modified benefits indefinitely and achieve low risk outside the pension protection fund ... "
Our investment strategy means that the financial position of the programme has not been affected by the recent decline in the rate of return on national debt, as many other British pension schemes have done, and we believe that the programme will provide modified benefits on a self-sufficient basis, as it has been proposed.

Yo-Yo is a childhood memory for many, but have you ever seen a little Yo-Yo turn a thousand pieces in his hand?
In just a few minutes, Yo-Yo traveled back and forth in his hand, changing a lot of games.
Yo-Yo is known to be not only a sport, but also one of the world's most flowery, difficult and rewarding handsmanship movements.
By turning the little ball in your hand, keeping the ball spinning and changing the ropes, it'll be able to display all sorts of new shapes in the air, like skyscrapers.
As the Yo-Yo movement developed, the Yo-Yo competition began to be held throughout the country, and the Yo-Yo games, which were able to practice fingering and intellectual creativity, became a way of working out for teenagers.
Two minutes late, parents angered the driver of the school bus and beat him in the driveway.

Huang Yuncheng, head of the secretariat of the Chinese Banking Association, stated that asset hosting had become an important link between the monetary market and the capital market and the real economy, as well as an important institutional arrangement to safeguard financial security.
As our direct financing and wealth management markets develop at a rapid pace, the market position of asset trusts is increasing.

It is worth noting that at present, our asset-custody mechanism is not sound, and in many areas it is not strictly applied, or even incorporated into it.
The absence of asset hosting mechanisms is an important reason for the outbreak of risk events in areas such as P2P network lending, private equity funds, etc.
The report recommends that an enterprise-wide, asset-wide, process-wide "host" model be implemented as soon as possible in order to better safeguard financial security and safeguard investors' interests.

The president of Shenzhen's Financial Services Agency, Hu Ying Peng, said that, as a self-financed risk reserve, if not paid, the company would pay VAT, which is a significant tax.
" But if, in consultation with the insurance company, the insurance company establishes such a product, the P2P platform buys it, and it can be used for VAT credits and the cost of the enterprise will be reduced... "
Hu Ying Peng suggested that Shenzhen, as an Internet finance pilot city, could be a forward-looking attempt by industry associations in consultation with insurance companies.

At the stage of the investigation of the case by the public security authorities, two former co-operatives and the chairman of one of the companies, the joint development of the hotel company, the parties signed a "agreement" on the issues involved in the case.
At the implementation stage of the agreement, the two parties will bring the other two to court to request confirmation that the "agreement" is null and void.
Recently, the case was decided by the People ' s Court of the Hylar District of the city of Huronbel, Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia.
Inner Mongolia, China-Wei Real Estate Development Co. Ltd., in collaboration with China-Cing Qingdong (Beijing) Investment Co. Ltd., developed a real estate project — the Huron-Belt Sunshine Hotel.
After China Wai Corporation and China Qingdong Union (Beijing) co-financed the establishment of the Sunshine Hotel Corporation, Dong was the Chairman and legal representative of the Sunshine Hotel Corporation.
Zhongqing Hong Kong Union (Beijing) Corporation, Inc., agreed that after the completion of the relevant obligations under this Agreement, Dong will apply to the public security authorities for the dismissal of the case and will no longer hold him liable.
After a good faith and full implementation of the agreement, Zhongqing Hong Kong Union (Beijing) Inc., the Sunshine Hotel Corporation, waived the right to hold China Wai, Dong and other responsible persons criminally liable and to civil liability.
This letter of agreement, signed on 24 April 2014, states that the Quartet agreed by consensus on the return of funds appropriated and misappropriated by Dong and his staff.
The terms of the agreement include, inter alia, the amount and timing of a refund, the transfer of shares in the Sunshine Hotel and the change of legal representation.
In October 2015, the two parties to the letter of agreement — China Wai and Dong Zi — will bring the other two parties to the letter of agreement — China Qinghong Hong Kong Union (Beijing) and Skylar Hotel Corporation — to court.
The defence replied that the public security organs had conducted a judicial audit, which had resulted in the appropriation of more than $29 million by Dong and the accountant.
In February 2014, Dong made an offer to contact the Qinghong Hong Kong Union (Beijing) and the parties signed a letter of agreement during their negotiations in the conference room of the public security organs.
Dong-gi also pleaded guilty and repented, asked for an understanding and returned $5 million of his money to the Sunshine Hotel Company.
The plaintiff's attorney claimed that Dong had asked a lawyer to find out whether the act of borrowing was a crime or not.
The letter of agreement was signed on the assumption that Dong-go had been convicted of embezzlement, contrary to article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Criminal liability and the transfer of equity fall under different legal categories, which cannot be confused, cannot be traded, let alone swapped for "exoneration", and "agreement" is a legitimate form of cover-up for illegal purposes.
The plaintiff argued that criminal liability was a State public power exercised by statutory organs of the State, such as the Public Prosecution Act, and was not subject to private agreements.
The agreement signed by the parties on 24 April 2014 violated the mandatory provisions of national laws and regulations and violated the public interest.
Therefore, whether or not a crime is committed, an agreement to "renouncing criminal liability" is not legally valid.
According to the defence's representative, the nature of the "agreement" is that the suspect and the victim reach a civil understanding in the course of the criminal proceedings.
The "letter of agreement" was established and implemented in order to maximize the economic loss of the victim, so that the suspect could receive a lighter penalty, which was not an unlawful purpose and did not violate the mandatory provisions of the law and regulations.
The signing of the "agreement" is a true expression of Dong's intention, and the seal is valid by the signature of the parties.
The defence considers that the crimes of "absorption of office" and "diversion of funds" are public prosecution cases, and it is the public security organs that decide whether to dismiss them or not, not the source.
The letter of agreement was merely an agreement that, upon completion of the execution of the order, the victim would apply to the public security authorities for the dismissal of the case and would not be in conflict with the exercise of the authority of the State to prosecute the crime.
At the same time, the Court held that the liability for breach of the agreement went beyond the liability of the ordinary civil agreement; the validity of the agreement should be examined in criminal proceedings ...
Upon receipt of the police alert, the Changzhou Government, the Yangquan City Public Security Bureau quickly and carefully prepared the emergency response plan and set up a disposal command to clarify the division of tasks, fine-tune working measures, implement responsibilities and fully deploy.

It is China's 50th World Heritage Site, and China has become the second largest World Heritage Site, so that the 50 World Heritage Sites can flourish and continue forever.
At present, there are a lot of heritage sites like "Renew, protect, develop, manage," and the world heritage is turned into "twisting the money."

In this regard, there are precedents, such as at the 2010 World Heritage Conference, where six Chinese World Heritage sites were warned by yellow tags, mainly over-exploitation leading to changes in the ecological environment of heritage sites.

According to the latest statistics of the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, Germany received 240,000 refugees in the first seven months of this year, a significant reduction from the projected number.
In 2015, there was a large influx of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa into Germany, where more than a million refugees were registered in that year.
The German Economic Weekly quoted the head of the agency Weiser on 11th, reporting that only 240,000 refugees have entered Germany so far this year, much less than expected.
Despite the decline in the number of refugees entering Germany, the Agency ' s task remains daunting, with some 500,000 asylum applications currently pending.
Nevertheless, an increasing number of refugees have brought the Bureau to court, some of whom have been waiting for more than two years.
By the end of 2015, nearly 2,300 cases had been filed against the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees for inaction.
According to the Central Bank of Russia, the main reason for the growth was the re-evaluation of the expectations of the Russian economy.
Russian international reserves include foreign exchange reserves, gold reserves, reserves position at the International Monetary Fund and special drawing rights, etc.
Russia's international reserves are controlled jointly by the Russian Government and the Central Bank and are used mainly to deal with economic risks.
In recent years, the Russian economy has been under downward pressure and international reserves have been shrinking as a result of Western sanctions imposed on Russia and the fall in international oil prices.
In recent years, big Hollywood films have been known as well-deserved protagonists of the film market, often producing excellent, star-crowding, propaganda campaigns, as if everybody was talking about it and going to the cinema to find out.
So, are these big pieces really, like we thought, coming in, rolling away a piece of money and coming back in full?
There's no doubt that the production costs of big Hollywood films are rising every year, much higher than the inflation rate.
According to the data in figure 1, 60 Hollywood films were produced over a 10-year period from 1995 to 2004 at a cost of over $100 million.
However, in the next 11 years, from 2005 to 2015, this number rose to 197.
The dramatic increase in the number of high productions means that the average production cost of films rises, which also raises industry vigilance.
Prominent directors Spielberg and Lucas criticized the phenomenon in a forum event: the industry would be imploding.
Of the 29 films, marketing costs were the highest 40 per cent of total costs and the lowest 24 per cent.
Physical copies, production of audio-visual products and their cost of transport averaged $67.8 million.
It is important to correctly estimate the number of copies and audio-visual products required, especially in the DVD market, where a "refundable" sales policy has been adopted.
In 2005, the Dream Factory produced 5 million sets of Shrek-2 DVDs, but the sale went down badly, directly resulting in the non-achievement of its revenue targets for the current season.
These 29 films will also spend an average of $36.6 million on income-sharing and compensation, largely by directors, producers, writers, leading creators, etc.
For big Hollywood studios, the revenue-sharing mechanism can help reduce financial pressures in the prior period; it is also an incentive for creators.
Of the 29 films, the average income of profit-making films was 9 per cent, the highest 18 per cent, and even the average income of lost films was about 5 per cent.
It's worth noting that the founders would ask to participate in the "income-sharing" rather than the "profit-sharing".
It's because, with the operation of Hollywood's cunning accounting system, some of the big-earned movies could turn into a loss.
For example, in 2010, a report leaked by Harry Potter5 showed that two years after the film was released, Warner continued to claim a loss of $167 million, making the profit split an empty phrase.
Hollywood will also need to pay a bonus to an association of all categories of staff, with an average of $1176 million paid in 29 films.
In addition, the operating costs of Hollywood Films will be shared among the various films in each department, with an average of US$ 14.83 million distributed among the 29 films.
After deduction of sales tax and cinema splits, the producers receive 53 per cent of the North American box office and 41 per cent of the international box office, which earns approximately $169 million.
After deducting an average of $98 million in marketing costs for cinema distribution, only about $70 million remains.
In terms of home video distribution, the 29 films generated an average income of $134.3 million.
After the removal of an average of $21.9 million in marketing costs and $30.5 million in production costs, the average net gain was $81.9 million, the highest income, with a much higher profit margin compared to cinema distribution.
The paid television channel generated slightly more revenue for these films than the free channel, which averaged $14.6 million, while the paid television channel generated $13.3 million.
About half of the 29 films received less than 1 per cent of the on-demand income, and even those released after 2011 received only 4.1 per cent.
Hollywood still has a more conservative attitude to video spots as it constructs these super-large distribution systems.
For derivative development, the 29 films generated an average of $11.5 million by authorizing derivative development.
But almost two thirds of the derived development revenues came from the top two super-largest films, and only one third of the films made more than $1 million.
In addition to the above-mentioned sources of income, these Hollywood films have a fractional revenue from air show, music, etc., which averages no more than $2.7 million.
Surprisingly, according to Stephen, the average profit of the 29 Hollywood films was $14.8 million, with a profit margin of only 3.7 per cent.
And given the long income recovery process, this profit margin is likely to be hard to beat inflation.
Films with the lowest cost range (100-125 million dollars) show the lowest profitability, with only one third earning money.
Three-quarters of the films at the highest cost (over $200 million) are profitable.

According to Japanese media, Foreign Minister Wen Hsiung Chishida of Japan undertook a visit to the Philippines on 11 August and held talks with President Doutelt of Japan to strengthen bilateral cooperation.
Japan and the United States are eager to approach the Philippines in terms of economic cooperation, with the intention of preventing the Philippines from falling to China.
According to Japan's "Economic News" website, on August 11, Kishida will hold talks with Duttelt and Philippine Foreign Minister Asael in the southern Philippines, the first meeting between a Japanese cabinet member and Duttelt.
Qiichida traveled to Duttt's base camp, Davao, not Manila, to confirm cooperation with the Philippines on the South China Sea as soon as possible.
In late July, Kerry met with Duttert in Manila on the day after participating in the ASEAN-related meeting organized by Laos, and the parties agreed to respect the South China Sea arbitral award.
Dutelt said to Kerry, "The arbitral award will be the basis for any consultation. "
At that time, Kerry offered to provide US$ 32 million in assistance to the Philippine Government, and it is highly likely that during the 11th meeting, Kishida again indicated assistance for the construction of the north-south commuter railway in Manila.
According to the report, the rush to get closer to Duttelt was due to the Philippines' intensification of bilateral consultations with China.
According to reports, the United States and Japan have been increasing their cooperation with the Philippines, with the new military agreement signed by the United States and the United States in 2014, once again allowing the United States military to de facto establish a base in the Philippines for 25 years.

On 10 August, Philippine President Duttelt again criticized United States Ambassador Gothenburg and accused him of interfering in the internal affairs of the Philippines.
Last April, during the Philippine presidential election campaign, Goldberg accused Dootelt of human rights issues, with successive statements and intense clashes between the two sides.
Dutter expressed strong dissatisfaction with Gothenburg's interference in the elections and even threatened to break ties with the United States after his election as President.
On 5th, Duttert's old story was repeated, expressing once again his dissatisfaction with Goldberg and criticizing its interference in the internal affairs of the Philippines.
The press spokesman of the President of the Philippines had said that the President had not forgotten the suffering caused to the Philippines by Western colonizers headed by the United States.
At the end of July, when United States Secretary of State Kerry visited the Philippines, people gathered outside the United States Embassy in the Philippines and raised their mark asking for "American troops to get out of the Philippines".
China has a bright civilization, a large population, which has long been at the forefront of world development and is now the second largest economy in the world.

There is no doubt that the cultural self-confidence presented at this time is based on the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people's full recognition of their own cultural values and firm confidence in their viability.
A lot of people have found that in a series of speeches, articles, speeches, interviews, the ancient Chinese scripts, the classics, the high level of cultural self-confidence, has aroused widespread resonance throughout the world.
It turns out that the rise of modern China has been accompanied by the increasing attraction of Chinese culture to influence.
China's nearly 100-year-old modern history has long shown us that roads, theories and institutions are rooted in culture.
We have learned from the West, institutions and culture, and we have been reflecting on it.
After a long search, we found that China's firm confidence in modernization was rooted in the "single genes" of the Chinese nation.
In Xi's speech and study, there were countless references to the excellent traditional culture of China, including Confucian thought.
In the 18th collective study of the Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping stressed that China's present day has evolved from yesterday and the day before yesterday.
He added that for thousands of years, the Chinese nation had followed a course of civilized development different from that of other nations and peoples.
It was no accident that we opened the path of China's special socialism, which was determined by our historical heritage and cultural traditions.
In 2010, China ' s GDP officially jumped to the second highest in the world, but China is not the only country with economic success.
Since the 18th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, China has taken a more prominent position in building a socialist cultural power and is committed to creating a new "gold age" of cultural development.
The best traditional culture, revolutionary culture, and advanced socialist culture show unprecedented vitality.
Although the Chinese culture has a long history and a very strong momentum, it is undeniable that its current impact and impact are far from being as high as it should be.
Although China has experienced a loss in the last few centuries, it has now returned to the world stage in a more powerful way ... "
In an interview with a journalist, the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey, Mehmet Simsek, stated that Chinese culture had made a great contribution to the world.
As Himshek said, China is now contributing to the world in a new way.

New college students buy preferential train tickets on the basis of a letter of admission only for the new ones, while the rest of them don't.

Of course, in addition to the increase in the patient base, the increase in the number of female patients is also due to the growing emphasis on mental health.
Suh told the East that in the past, many people in life were "hard" or evasive in the face of psychological problems.
At the same time, the lack of awareness of depression and anxiety among the general public, misperceived as an emotional disorder of the patient, and the failure to provide adequate understanding and emotional support in a timely manner, is also the main reason for the low level of access.
" Today, with the right understanding of mental health issues and the importance attached to mental health, many patients and their families are able to face the situation properly ... "
Suh told Dong that as a result, more and more patients are willing to go to the hospital and receive help from professionals.

The "Kin English Law" known as the most stringent anti-corruption law in Korean history will be in force next month, requiring public officials to accept a meal at a cost of not more than 30,000 won (approximately 181 yuan).
The Korean Federation reported on the 10th day that this has challenged many of the Korean restaurants that used to cater to politicians and high-ranking civil servants.
A lot of restaurants have adjusted their rates to introduce cheaper packages, and some have closed them down.
Korea League reports that a number of Korean restaurant owners are now worried about their future performance because of "Kinjilan"
In Seoul, the Yamakawa restaurant, which has been in operation since 1969, is visited by politicians, government officials, media journalists and businessmen.
The hotel owner told the Korean press that for years they had been proud to provide their customers with high-quality food and a private dining environment.
Over the last 10 years, the hotel has been offering high-spectrum packages, but "to meet the ceiling on the cost of meals, we will be forced to change decades of tradition, which is a tough decision."
"Charcofire Barbecue Village" is dominated by beef barbeque, whose general manager, Kim Ki-fook, says that the restaurant's brand-named "Hong Cow" is worth more than 50,000 won.
"We expect a substantial reduction in sales starting in October, and we're considering replacing the Korean cattle in the package with imported beef."

On August 12th, the news spokesman of the National Statistical Office announced today that the unemployment rate in Liaoning's town was higher than the national average, and that the internal pressure was higher because of the restructuring of its economy.
The Press Office of the State Council held a press conference today on the functioning of the national economy in July 2016.
In the broader context, the international economy is undergoing deep adjustment and recovery has been slow, and exports to China, including Liaoning Province, are under considerable pressure.
At the domestic level, China is in a critical period of structural adjustment, and the contradiction between excess traditional industries and insufficient growth of effective market demand is still greater, and the pains of adjustment of traditional industries are still being unleashed.
So this round of adjustment is precisely the deepest price adjustment for the rechemical product, so the inevitable downward pressure on the Liao Ning economy.
During the "1205" period, the expansion of real estate, the better infrastructure development in Liaoning and the higher housing base.
After entering the 13th, this round of real estate adjustments, due to its higher base, is much lower in terms of data performance than in other regions.
In conclusion, Liaoning ' s economic adjustment has special economic reasons, both cyclical and structural, as well as the impact of the base-digit effect, which is generally in the process of adjustment.
In addition, Liaoning's urban survey of unemployment rates is higher than the national average, and because its economy is adjusting, internal pressure is higher.
According to data for the last two months, the Liaoning economy shows signs of stability, and the indicators are shrinking.
We believe that, with the joint efforts of all parties, the economy of the Northeast, including Liaoning, will be re-emerged in the old industrial base of Japan.

With the recent inauguration of the city and the announcement of the primary school district of Gao Xing, the "school room" has once again become the subject of concern for the citizens of Jinning.

According to the information received, there are more than 3,000 children left behind in the Mid-Ocean, most of whom live at home with their elderly grandparents, because parents need to work abroad to earn money, and they can only meet their parents once a year.
The absence of kinship and proper guidance is often an irreparable regret for these children in their childhood.

It doesn't have boundaries, as long as you need it, as long as you dare to mobilize.

The decision was taken after talks between President Maduro of Venezuela and President Santos of Colombia.
According to BBC reports, it was agreed that the first phase would open up five gates on the border between the two countries to allow for the entry and exit of pedestrians.

On 21 September last year, the leaders of the two countries met and agreed for the first time to gradually reopen their borders and normalize their relations.
When it comes to the village of the nation, we always think of the mountains of the Shinshin, the mysterious culture, the simple villagers, but there's still the poverty, the scarcity, the cynicism behind it.

In the town of Mlandizi, Kibaha County, Tanzania Coast Province, Wang Tree, from Hebei, China, is constantly busy, and in October this year a steel factory will come into operation.
" Tanzania ' s annual steel band demand has reached 1.83 million tons, but the quality of locally produced steel bars does not meet the requirements of high-rise buildings, such as bridges, where 70 per cent of the country ' s steel bars are imported ... "
This long-standing Chinese steel entrepreneur has broken Tanzania's enormous appeal to him, and that's the vast potential of the local market.
Like Wang Tree, more and more Chinese entrepreneurs are looking to Africa for business opportunities.

The CBC commentator mistook Michael Phelps for Ryan Rochett throughout the game.
An Olympic commentator at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) encountered an awkward situation on Thursday night, when he confused Michael Phelps with his opponent Ryan Rochett.
Elliot Friedman completely misidentified the two men during the 200-metre mixed swim final.
Just as Phelps was quick to win, Friedman thought of him as Rochett, a fellow Phelps and a long-time opponent at the World Swimming Championship.
Friedman says, "In the end, he's gonna win!"
Ryan Rochett will defeat Michael Phelps in this race!
Phelps may not even be on the stage.
But it's Phelps who wins the game, and Rochett only gets the fourth.
The moment Phelps touched the gold, the CBC radio silenced.
Friedman immediately admitted the mistake.
I apologize. I confused the swimway.
"It's Phelps who gets the gold medal," he says.
After the misbroadcast, the Canadian commentator was widely praised for his professionalism, and in the hours following the match, he once again confessed to his mistakes and apologized to the audience on Twitter.
I'm sorry, everybody.
I screwed up.
"No excuse," he wrote.
At the same time, Phelps broke a 2168-year-old record by winning the highest number of Olympic champions in history for his personal project.
The previous record was maintained by Leonidas of Rhodes Island, who is believed to have won the most Olympic championships in the ancient Olympics.
It'll be easier to find parking places in the happiest places in the world.
Disneyland released a detailed proposal for the construction of a much-anticipated parking building, a transport centre and a new pedestrian bridge at the east end of the theme park resort.
The project is located in the east of the resort area near Highway 5, including a parking building with 6,800 spaces and a transport centre where park tourists can get off by bus, commuter, taxi and other vehicles.
A pedestrian bridge will be installed on the Bay Boulevard to connect the resort, parking building and traffic centre.
The parking building, as well as the ongoing construction of a 14-acre planetary battlefield expansion, are part of a $1 billion investment in the city of Anaheim in exchange for a 30-year recreational tax exemption.
This project, known as the East Gate, will begin next year.
The parking building will be built in Pumbaa Park, Disneyland, which currently has 1,300 spaces.
The transport centre will be built on the site of a commercial property purchased by the subject park in 2014.
The entire project is expected to be operational by 2018.
Ms. Susie Brown, spokesperson for Disneyland, said: " The East Gate Project, which is part of our major investment in the city of Anaheim, will provide more tourist parking and help alleviate congestion in the resort as we continue to expand the Disneyland resort. "
Four people were killed as a result of the explosion in the Thai tourist zone.
After the voters voted to adopt a new constitution supported by the military government, a series of bombings targeting tourist destinations took place on Thursdays and Fridays in five southern provinces of Thailand, killing four people and wounding several others.
On Thursday night, the Hua Xin beach resort was first hit by two explosions, followed by another one on Friday morning.
The town is about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok.
According to the police, the first explosion resulted in the death of a Thai woman and the injury of 20 others, 10 of whom were foreign nationals.
The authorities have confirmed that there have been multiple bombings in the southern cities of Pudge, Dong Ri and Bandung.
There were two bomb explosions in the town of Badon in Pugi, and two other explosions occurred in the Gaving House in the tourist area near northern Pugi city.
In the last 24 hours, there have been 11 bomb explosions in Thailand.
Colonel Quesana Patanacharoun, an official of the Royal Thai Police, stated on Friday that the bombings had nothing to do with Islamic extremism, but were deliberate acts of vandalism at the local level.
He said, "It's too early to make a quick conclusion."
But we are convinced that these events are not directly related to any type of terrorism, and in fact they are deliberate acts of destruction at the local level, and we are trying to identify those responsible for the events.
Following a small bomb explosion in Hua Xin on August 12, 2016, the investigating officer collected evidence from the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials indicated that a series of bomb attacks on the vital tourism industry in Thailand had resulted in four deaths and that the authorities were busy identifying the motives of the incident and finding the perpetrators.
There is no conflict in Thailand that could lead to terrorists being born there.
"So we can say that these events are not terrorist attacks," he added.
No organization has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks, and no particular group has been accused by the authorities, although the bombings took place in the same week as the Thai electorate voted for the adoption of the new constitution.
Hua Xin, Puji and the three southern provinces in which the capital is located are opposed to a referendum supported by the military junta, and these Muslim-majority south-eastern provinces of Thailand have been engaged in insurgency since 2004 and have resulted in the deaths of more than 6,500 people.
These bombings took place on the birthday of Queen Slygi of Thailand and on a public holiday in the country.
Wah Xin is the home of the palace, where the Thai monarchs often lie.
King Pumibol Adud is the longest-serving monarch in the world.
Signs of Ukraine: What is Vladimir Putin doing?
It's hard to judge what the truth is about these claims.
Ukraine denied it, while the United States and the European Union indicated that Russia had not provided any evidence.
The digital forensics lab (an open source analysis organization) found signs of an exchange of fire on Saturday, but Moscow's exaggerated rhetoric has little basis.
Russia's distortion or misrepresentation of events for political purposes is well known, especially in the fog of ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
That doesn't mean that Russia's claims are hypocritical.
Last year, Ukrainian civilian armed forces destroyed power towers for the supply of electricity to Crimea, some of whom were also involved in criminal offences and human rights violations.
An attempted attack in Crimea is not impossible, although there is little reason to doubt that the Ukrainian government will support such a plot.
Whatever happens, the images found by the open source analyst show that Russia's military presence in Crimea has been escalating since at least Saturday (before the so-called attack).
These images show heavy weapons escorts moving on the peninsula, including coastal defence missile systems.
The familiar, but disturbing, Russian escalation.
According to some reports, a new rotation of Russian troops in Crimea has been planned for the current stage, which will help explain the activities, although, by coincidence, this coincided with the most tense period since the seizure in 2014.
Whatever happened this weekend, Mr. Putin's statement against Ukraine has undoubtedly escalated and has chosen to use this episode (however true it may be) for some greater purpose.
Analysts have pointed out that this is a disturbing similarity to the performance of Russia prior to its earlier military operations against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar statements and military exercises provided cover for the seizure of the peninsula by the voluntary Crimean militia, while the Crimean peninsula remained under Ukrainian control, which only showed that the militias were in fact special forces of the Russian military occupation.
In August of that year, as Russian-backed separatists retreated in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin stationed his troops along the border warning that they might need to "protect" Russian civilians in Ukraine, who he said were being attacked.
He planned an aid escort to the area, but NATO claims that it was simply intended to cover up the Russian invasion.
What exactly did Mr. Putin plan in Crimea?
Some want to know if Moscow is planning another intervention.
The war in Eastern Ukraine has escalated, as it did before the August 2014 invasion.
However, this apparent similarity may be focused on creating fear of military action, rather than actual action, which would give Mr. Putin a great deal of leverage in his games with Ukraine and Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, a professor of Russian affairs at New York University, pointed out that Crimea was used as a staging ground for military operations against Eastern Ukraine, which was bordering the Russian mainland and not Crimea, and that the defence situation in other parts of the country was better.
Mr. Galeoti said, "The Russians can't really plan some major offensive. "
Instead, "What we see is the classic Russian strategy of creating tension."
Mr. Putin, through the mechanism of the international peace talks on Ukraine, has forced his Western leaders to avoid engaging with him because of Russia's annexation of Crimea, which has become increasingly futile.
By taking advantage of the new and unresolved threats of conflict, Mr. Putin has provided a new rationale for such talks: to persuade him to stay on the cliff.
Referring to the next peace talks planned for early September, Mr. Galeoti stated: " This is a standard Putin tactic that he wants to take advantage of before he comes to the talks. "
The only real advantage is to say, "I can make things worse if I want to."
The location of the bargain with the West
Mr. Putin also said this week that there was no point in continuing negotiations during the tense period in Crimea, forcing other parties to persuade him to return to the negotiating table, thus placing himself at the centre of such a process.
What would he actually get if he did that?
First of all, it allows Russia to continue to claim that it is a world power, even though its enemy is smaller than Australia.
Secondly, it gives Moscow the right of veto over Ukraine's sovereignty, leaving that country under some degree of Russian control.
It also serves Mr. Putin's long-standing desire to enter into a major deal with the United States, and logically resolves the dispute between the two sides over Ukraine and Syria under conditions favourable to Moscow, and puts an end to Western sanctions against Russia.
Since the collapse of Russian enemies in late 2014, Mr. Putin has repeatedly suggested this objective, largely due to the decline in the value of Russian oil and gas exports.
Since he intervened in Syria last fall, he has invited the great Western powers to join him as a great ally against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may think that they need to secure such a deal before President Obama leaves office in January.
Russian officials tend to see Hillary Clinton as a potential successor and become more hostile to Moscow.
Donald Trump, while apparently friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Mr. Galeoti said, however, that Mr. Obama was seen as a "settling, not a conflict".
So there's a feeling that the window of opportunity is closing, and there's a need to speed things up.
At the same time, if there is no major deal, Mr. Putin would be happy to let Russia's weak neighbors think about what's going to happen.
An earlier version of the paper misspelled the year when Russia invaded Ukraine to annex Crimea.
It's supposed to be 2014 instead of 2013.
Congress is deadlocked. The White House has set aside funds to fight the card.
On Thursday, the Obama administration stated that it was releasing $81 million from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health-care programmes to develop a baccalaureate virus vaccine because Congress had not approved the new funding needed to deal with the virus.
In a letter to members of Congress, the United States Secretary of Health and Public Service, Silvia Matthews Powell, stated that, without the release of the money, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedicine High Research and Development Authority would have exhausted the funds allocated at the end of the month to deal with this mosquito-borne disease.
At a time when there is an increase in local exposure to the silo virus in Miami, vaccine development will have to be suspended at a critical stage due to lack of funding.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 7,350 card cases had occurred in the United States as of last week, most of them in Puerto Rico.
According to Ms. Powell, 15 babies have been born with congenital defects caused by the baccalaureate virus.
The virus can cause brain abnormalities and other serious defects in children born to infected pregnant women.
At the end of last month, there were the first cases of the disease spreading on the mainland of the United States, and there was a corresponding increase in political leverage around the federal government's response.
Hillary Clinton campaigned on Tuesday in Wynwood, a town adjacent to Miami that has seen a series of locally transmitted card cases that have forced Congress to interrupt its five-week recess to adopt emergency funding to combat the virus.
President Obama and Republicans in Congress have for most of this year been dissatisfied with the issue of the bourgeois virus.
In February, Mr. Obama requested an emergency allocation of $1.9 billion.
The Republicans refused the request, asking for more detailed accounts of the whereabouts of the funds.
For months, parliamentarians have been arguing about how much money should be earmarked and how much money should be earmarked.
Last month, the Democrats rejected a Republican proposal to allocate $1.1 billion to combat the baccalaureate, but included a provision prohibiting the financing of family planning associations to provide HIV-related contraceptive conditions, which could be sexually transmitted.
This impasse prompted the White House to release $589 million in April from Ebola research funding for the fight against the silo virus, about two thirds of which was earmarked for use in the United States.
On Thursday, Ms. Powell said her department was already using half of that money, and it'll be all out by the end of August.
Ms. Powell wrote: " The failure to approve the emergency additional funding for the response to the silo virus has forced the Government to choose between delaying the development of key vaccines and diverting funds from other valuable government projects in order to avoid delays for the time being. "
Democrats used the announcement to accuse Republicans of failing to provide additional funding to fight the silo virus.
At the press conference, the California Congressman, minority leader Nancy Pelussi, called on the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, to bring Congress back on track to push for such measures.
Ms. Pelussi said: "All possible options are being exhausted, and now we plan to go to the National Institute of Health, which is a priority. "
Mr. Ryan's assistant said that freeing up those funds was a long-delayed step by the Obama administration to extract as much political advantage as possible from the silo virus problem.
The National Institute of Health announced last week that it had begun a clinical trial of a card vaccine on 80 human subjects and that it was expected to start a second trial in early 2017 in the "Zakat countries. "
However, since there is no more funding, officials have indicated on Thursday that the conference has stopped.
Ms. Powell indicated that she would transfer $34 million from the funds earmarked by the National Institute of Health for research into other diseases such as cancer and diabetes.
An additional $47 million will be allocated to the Biomedicine Advanced Research and Development Authority to support the development of drugs and vaccines in response to public health emergencies.
These funds will come from a variety of accounts, including $19 million transferred from a plan to subsidize heating oil for low-income families and $4 million transferred from a plan to deal with drug abuse (e.g. opioid addiction).
Ms. Powell said that even then, the supplementary funds would only be available for the next month, when, if Congress did not act, the research institute against the bourgeois virus would have to "severely weaken a lot of critical work".
Over the past four months, CDCs have spent $60 million on assisting states to protect pregnant women, $25 million on strengthening state preparedness and response plans for the Sakat outbreak, and $16 million on helping states to create data collection systems for rapid detection of complications associated with small head malformations and other scavengers.
Thai leaders believe that the attack on tourist attractions is related to constitutional change.
On Friday, the Thai military head of government urged citizens to be patient while the investigators were trying to find out who was behind the series of deadly bombings in Thailand this week.
The Head of the Military Government and Prime Minister, General Baya Jamahan, hinted that the perpetrators were "some bad people" who opposed the new constitution adopted by Thai voters in the national referendum on Sunday.
In his national speech, he said, "There are still some bad people who have been acting since before the start of the referendum. "
Thursday and Friday bombings in five provinces resulted in four deaths and dozens of injuries, including in the tourist resorts of Phuket and Hua Xin.
According to the authorities, other arson attacks in Thailand also appear to be connected.
According to analysts, these bombings do not seem to have killed many people, but rather to disrupt the tourism industry, which is one of Thailand's few economic bright spots.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Hua Xin.
Sunay Pasouk, Senior Fellow of Human Rights Watch, stated: " Whatever the motive, these explosions and arson attacks have shaken the military junta ' s claim that the situation would remain stable after the referendum ... "
These attacks have resulted in the stigmatization of authorities, the intimidation of the public and the undermining of the economy based on tourism.
Photos of Thai rescue workers treating a victim injured in the bombing of the Hwa Xin bomb on Friday.
Police say they don't think these bombings are related to international terrorism or to the long-standing Islamic rebellion in southern Thailand.
They described these attacks as "local sabotage" rather than terrorism.
The timing and location of these attacks are highly symbolic in political terms.
The bombing took place on Friday, when people were preparing to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikit, which was also considered Mother's Day in Thailand.
Four bombs struck the royally resident town of Hua Xin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most of the wounded came from.
A constitution drafted by the military will weaken the influence of political parties and give the military greater power, even after the military has put the government under civilian control.
The military government ensures the success of its victory by preventing opponents from launching a campaign against them.
The US Center for International Strategic Studies South-East Asia expert, Murray Hibert, has noticed that the Thai military suspect that the perpetrators of these attacks were disgruntled voters.
He said that the bombings were "manifestly coordinated, but clearly intended to create an atmosphere of terror and anxiety rather than to create massive destruction and casualties".
Last year, 20 people were killed in a bomb explosion at the shrine of Irawan, a tourist destination in Bangkok, most of them Chinese tourists.
Thai officials attributed the bombing to the fact that more than 100 Uighurs were returned to China to annoy Uighur militants.
General Bayoy has been leading the military since a coup d ' état overthrew the elected government in Thailand in 2014, saying that this week 's bombing has caused the Thai people to "worried."
He said, "Why now, when the state of the country, the economy and tourism are improving?"
We have to ask who did it for what.
How does Simon Manuel's historical moment look?
Just as I entered this game tonight, I kind of wanted to get rid of the burden of my own black community, and I got here with it.
But I really want it to disappear.
I'm so happy that I can inspire others and hope to advance the diversity of sport.
But at the same time, I'd like to see more blacks one day than black swimmers Simon, because the title of black swimmers sounds like I shouldn't have been able to win a gold medal or break a record.
It's not like that. I work as hard as anyone else, and I love this movement, and I want to win like anyone else.
Colombia ' s struggle to protect non-heterosexual students
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Arig jumped out of a shopping mall in Bogotá, where he quoted Pink Freud's lyrics, "Goodbye Cruel World".
His death was the beginning of a debate this week that left Colombia restless, because the struggle for greater rights for the LGBT community was caught up in a broader political struggle that plunged the country into a polarization of opinion.
After Areg's death, his mother, Arva Reyes, sued school officials, accusing them of deliberately excluding her only son from the group after discovering that he had a close relationship with a classmate.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia issued a final ruling in support of her view and called on schools throughout the country to develop clearer anti-discrimination policies.
The ruling was part of a series of legal victories by the Colombian movement for gay rights, which was celebrated earlier this year by Colombia's ruling to legalize same-sex marriages.
This week, however, their struggle for equality has hit the wall, and the Minister of Education, the public homosexual Gina Perrotti, has become the flashpoint of a scandal in the implementation of the ruling.
When the sexual exposure of a porn magazine began to spread on social media and the distributors claimed it was part of the instruction manual issued by the Ministry of Education, the controversy broke out.
Ms. Perrotti quickly uncovered that lie.
Although the Ministry of Education provided guidance to schools on issues relating to sexual orientation and gender identity to help them take note of the decision, it did not seek to enforce the Standardized Rules.
In an interview on Thursday, Ms. Perrotti said, "What we want is for schools to have the means to resolve conflicts. "
In a national debate on the topic "The future of the country torn apart by the peace negotiations between the Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)," the dispute opened a new front.
The coalition of statesmen opposed to the Government and the leaders of the Catholic Church mobilized at an extraordinary rate to accuse the Government of President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting same-sex unions and gender movements.
On the other hand, the Government delegation that recently negotiated in Havana with FARC reached an agreement on gender and LGBT equality, which called on the Government to adopt a more inclusive policy.
Critics of the government and the peace talks have been slamming the posterior of Colombian politics, Ms. Perrotti, 42 years old.
They showed rough posters at the rally, and some threatened to commit acts of violence against her and her partner, former Minister of Commerce Cecilia Álvarez Correa Glenn.
In that unpleasant week, Ms. Perrotti was very patient, trying to clarify her misunderstandings and re-establish a constructive debate.
She said, "This is part of the reason I'm strong and sober, and I know that there are children out there in the closet (public recognition of sexual orientation). "
It's a difficult phase, and it's a very lonely moment.
She also linked the peace process to the debate about LGBT students.
She said that as Colombians continued to weigh the benefits of an agreement with FARC, this would be a turning point for the country, which must consider the root causes of the conflict.
She said, "Whether a peaceful State should promote inclusion or condone exclusion; should it give equal opportunities to all?"
Although she was unhappy that she had been the object of humiliation and harassment this week, she was pleased that in Colombia today, homosexual students could look up to her and think that they could become ministers one day.
Ms. Perrotti said, "It's important for me that they be comfortable and realize that they can make use of their full potential. "
We can't wait for the next suicide to start changing.
Security of the electoral network — The New York Times
According to a news report published on August 4, "The United States seeks ways to stop hackers from getting their hands on ballot boxes",
According to the United States Secretary of Homeland Security, Jay Johnson, the Obama administration is discussing additional protective measures for the United States electoral system.
This change may be necessary and should be considered for immediate implementation.
The diverse nature of cyber-threats, and recent indications of a greater interest by external actors (possibly nation States) in the elections affecting the United States, make it imperative for the federal Government to give additional attention to the security of the national electoral system and to consider it an integral part of America's critical infrastructure.

In recent days, the British government has suddenly announced the suspension of its cooperation with China-French Cape Hinkley nuclear power project, which has attracted widespread attention both at home and abroad.
The British Government spokeswoman said earlier that the British postponement of the project did not mean that the enthusiasm for China had cooled, that China and the United Kingdom were still cooperating in a wide range of areas, and that the United Kingdom would continue to seek to maintain strong relations with China.
Experts point out that China ' s nuclear power is at the world ' s leading level in terms of technology, safety performance, operating experience, etc., and relatively inexpensive.
Thus, while nuclear power out of the sea will be tested by the wind for a certain period of time, the trend towards mutually beneficial cooperation will not change with the great win-win potential.
And it's obviously hard to describe Britain's performance on the Hinkley Cape Nuclear Power Project.
When completed, the project will cover 7 per cent of the UK ' s electricity needs; and 9 million tonnes of CO2 per year will be reduced during 60 years of operation.
Analysts are generally of the view that the United Kingdom ' s own exposure to economic risks, increased domestic political divisions, cumbersome procedures for follow-up to the de-European Union and increased uncertainty in the future together constitute obstacles to nuclear power projects.
"The current decline in real estate prices in the United Kingdom and the start of capital outflows have made the stabilization of the domestic economy and the market system a top priority for the new British Government.
At the same time, after the Deutsche referendum, the United Kingdom will then face a series of de-European procedures and re-establish relations with European Union countries such as France.
Suh Ming Cai said that, while the attitude of the new British government to "distinct" from the previous administration was clear, it did not negate the positive significance of the nuclear power project.
But in the last two decades, nuclear power has stalled in the United Kingdom, and most of the 15 existing nuclear power plants have reached their design life.
According to the British Energy White Paper, only one nuclear power plant will remain in operation in the United Kingdom by 2025, when there will be a major power supply gap.
That is why there is widespread concern about the suspension of the British project, which is a matter of public well-being.
Schiller believes that China can play a key role in helping Britain rebuild its infrastructure, as long as it is in the interest of both countries.
According to Liu Xiaoming, the project will only be successfully launched to provide the United Kingdom with early access to safe, reliable and sustainable energy.
According to industry sources, nuclear power projects will not only help the British to reduce the cost of electricity use, but will also boost the local economy and generate employment.
Therefore, if the new British government ultimately decides from the perspective of maximizing the well-being of the population, the prospects for nuclear power projects are not pessimistic.
The United Kingdom can alleviate the energy demand gap, while China and France can find markets for their own technology and products in the field of nuclear power for the benefit of more people ... "
Despite the increased uncertainty of the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant project, China ' s high-level and mature experience with nuclear power technology is certain.
In the case of China's "Walong One", which is scheduled to enter the British nuclear power market, it has been designed to integrate the advantages of other advanced nuclear power technology designs and to learn from past experience.
For example, in response to the problems reflected in the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, China has designed the "Abnormally Motivated Residual Heat Ejection" system on the secondary side of the steam generator, which can release core heat in time to avoid core melting.
Liu Xiaoming stated that China has been developing nuclear power for more than 30 years with good operational performance and safety standards, and that achievements in nuclear power development and regulation have been highly valued by international agencies.
The relationship between China and the United Kingdom is at an important moment in history, and mutual respect and trust are all the more precious.
China hopes that the British Government will continue to support the Hinkley Point nuclear power project and take early decisions to ensure its successful implementation.
According to Ho Weiwen, Co-Chair of the Center for Economic and Strategic Research in Central America and Europe, China International Trade Society, there is not much time left for the British to make decisions, and the Chinese and British should take the necessary contacts and communications.
" After the change of President from Argentina, the Sino-Arab nuclear power plant project was also put on hold, but after a positive advance, the project is now clearly scheduled to begin in the first quarter of next year ... "

Today, there is a sharp increase in the level of attention to tumors, which may be highly correlated with the high incidence of cancer in recent years.
According to the 2012 cancer report, there are approximately 3.37 million new cases of cancer and 2.11 million deaths per year.
Cancer has become the leading cause of death in our country, accounting for one quarter of global cancer deaths.
Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells, which can affect almost any part of the human body.
It's common to say that any part of the body may have a tumour, and that some tumours may be transferred to other parts of the body.
Cancer is a genetic disease, but research has found that only a fraction of cancer is genetic.
Many factors influence the development of cancer, of which environmental factors are most important and can be changed.
Environmental factors include smoking, infectious factors, radiation, pollution, food, nutrition, physical activity, etc.
He was taken to the hospital and the doctor told his family that Master Li was suffering from severe dehydration caused by diarrhoea, causing a high-permeability coma, which could kill him a few minutes later.
According to statistics, approximately 20 per cent of diabetes patients may have symptoms of diarrhoea, mostly in untreated or poorly controlled blood sugar patients.
Some diabetics have even started with chronic diarrhoea, which is highly confusing, leading to omissions and misdiagnostics.
Diarrhoea due to indigestion can be anorexic, disgusting, and anaesthesia can improve; bacterial diarrhoea tends to be acute, several times a day, with abdominal pain, and short treatment can almost heal.
Diarrhoeal diarrhoea, most manifested in persistent diarrhoea, no visible abdominal pain, and the testing of urine with no infection, is significantly more frequent, with a maximum of 20 cases per day.
In addition, some sugar-reducing drugs, such as those that begin to take sugar-reducing drugs such as diarrhea or alpha glucose enzyme inhibitors, may have side effects such as abdominal swelling, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.
That's because, after diarrhea, there's a risk of hyperglytic hyperglytic sugar and low blood sugar after diarrhea.
Also, because of the stress that diarrhoea causes in the human body, the release of multiple hormones and the additional mobilization of blood sugar in the face of diarrhoea, there is also a risk of ketonic acid poisoning in serious cases.
As a result, in addition to treating the causes of diarrhoea in sugar pals, the following should be noted.
Diabetes with acute diarrhea must first prevent dehydration, so it is important to drink more water, which will naturally drain more urine, both to remove excess blood sugar and to excrete the ketone.
But don't drink caffeine, because caffeine stimulates intestinal creeps and increases diarrhoea.
Diabetes patients suffer from an imbalance in blood sugar during acute diarrhoea, so it is important to keep a close eye on blood sugar changes, preferably measured every three to four hours.
The Food and Drug Administration of the United States has recently approved a field test of transgenic mosquitoes in south-eastern Florida.
This transgenic mosquito can help control the spread of mosquito-borne infections such as silovirus, dengue fever and Kikunkenya fever.
The preliminary environmental assessment released by the United States Drug Control Programme last March also concluded that the mosquitoes would not significantly affect the environment.
But the report also states that this does not amount to authorizing the use of transgenic mosquitoes for commercial purposes.
Oxford Insect Technology must also comply with other federal, state and local government regulations and decide on the timing of field trials with its local partner, the Florida Islands mosquito control area.
Experiments in Brazil, Panama and the Cayman Islands have shown that this transgenic mosquito can reduce the number of mosquitoes in the test area by more than 90 per cent.
The use of genetically modified technology, mosquito-resistant, is also controversial, and some experts believe it has an unknown impact on the environment.
In addition, Anhui Province has established an early warning system for the monitoring of essential drugs, which regularly publishes and informs the monitoring of high prices, high usage and non-therapeutic assistive drugs.

Fortunately, the good people found out that the men escaped after screaming at the truck driver and driving the truck to stop the truck.
The nice traveler is Yang Dong. His car recorder filmed a dangerous scene.
According to video footage, at about 1814 hours on the day of the incident, a middle-aged man drove through the road and suddenly came out of the rear side of a big truck on a bicycle.
When the big truck was trying to turn left, it knocked the man down and quickly caught him in the bottom of the truck.
However, at this point, the truck driver was blinded and failed to understand Yang Dong and was ready to continue driving.
On this emergency, Yang Dong immediately opened his window and shouted out to the truck driver: "There's someone under your car. Stop the car. "
Come on, he's driving straight ahead of the big van, stopping it, forcing it to stop.
The man then crawled out of the bottom of the car, stood up and, after a preliminary examination, his knee was slit, leaving no visible marks on the rest of the body.
The next day, in order to warn the driver to drive the car, he sent the car logs to the Internet, and many of his friends praised him for his behavior.

According to the Swedish Daily News, identity theft has become one of the fastest growing crimes in Swedish society.
Identity theft is a form of crime that illegally obtains information about the identity of another person as a means of impersonating another person for profit.
Sifo survey data show that 1/4 of the respondents have disclosed personal information in e-mail, cell phone text messages or other social media in the last 12 months.
The Managing Director of My Safety, a Swedish insurance company, noted that one of the reasons for the high incidence of identity theft was that people were not careful when using personal information, leaving criminals with space to drill.
The Swedish police have reportedly invested a lot of resources in the fight against identity theft since the summer.
It only constitutes a criminal offence to use stolen identities for fraudulent purposes, such as purchasing in the name of another person on the Internet.
According to the Swedish Daily News, the market for first-hand rental houses in all major cities in Sweden is on fire.
According to the latest data, the waiting time for first-hand rental housing has been extended over the last year instead of being shortened.
In particular, the waiting period in the capital city of Stockholm and the peri-urban areas has been extended by up to two years.
Currently, the average waiting time for a first-hand house contract in Stockholm is at least 16.5 years, while the average waiting time for a first-hand rental house in the peri-urban area of Stockholm is over 13 years.
According to the market director of the Swedish Housing Authority, the market for first-hand rental houses in Stockholm is short of demand, the queue has grown too fast and the waiting time for housing has reached an all-time high.
It has been reported that, despite the delivery of tens of thousands of new houses in Stockholm this year, the demand for first-hand rentals continues to grow.
According to the data, in the first half of the year there were only 2006 units for the first room (only old rooms, new rentals not included), while the first room lined up already exceeded 540,000 people.
According to the Swedish Daily, it'll take 130 years to get a rental house at the current pace.
The data for the last 12 months show that the housing crisis is not just a phenomenon in a city in the capital city of Stockholm, but that the waiting time for first-hand rental housing in Gothenburg and Malmö has been extended to varying degrees.

Pennsylvania boys were hit in a roller coaster, and the number of accidents at the playground this week increased to three.
On Thursday, a boy fell and was injured in a roller coaster, and was flown to a hospital in Pittsburgh. Emergency services and park officials said it was the third accident this week in the United States of America when a playground device hit a child.
The female spokesperson at the Westmoreland Emergency Services Centre explained that the injured child (his identity was not revealed) had been airlifted to the Pittsburgh Children's Hospital, about 50 miles (80 km) west of the Idlewild and SoakZone thematic park in Rigonier, Pennsylvania.
In an e-mail from the park spokesman, Jeff Crowshaw said that the three-year-old boy was playing a roller coaster with his brother, and he was conscious when he was on the scene.
Claushaw said that the car's playthings called "Rollo Crosser" would be shut down pending investigation.
The "Idlewild and SoakZone" theme park requires that children playing Rolo roller coaster must be at least 3 feet tall (91 cm), while children less than 4 ft tall (122 cm) must be accompanied by an adult.
According to the park website, the carnival device was built in 1938, and the state's Ministry of Agriculture indicated that it passed the inspection in August.

Japan Current News Agency: Japanese Prime Minister Abe will not attend the Yasukuni shrine on the anniversary of World War II
According to the Japan News Agency, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will not be attending the controversial Tokyo Yasukuni shrine on the occasion of Japan’s defeat in the Second World War.
On Thursday, however, the Japan Times News Agency reported that Abe was planning to offer rituals to the Yasukuni shrine on Monday to commemorate the anniversary.
The shrine has 14 Japanese leaders convicted of war crimes and is therefore regarded by China and South Korea as a symbol of Japanese militarism during the war.
Since December 2013, Abe has not personally visited the Yasukuni shrine, which he says he visited in order to show respect to those who gave their lives for the country.
The new Defense Minister of Japan, Pumi Rice, refused to say if she would join the Yasukuni shrine, which she considered a matter of conscience.
As Abe's close ally and supporter of a change in Japan's peace constitution, Pumi Rice used to visit the Yasukuni.
According to Co-Counsel, the Japanese Minister of Renaissance, Ahhiro Amura, visited the shrine on Thursday and said he prayed for peace and prosperity in Japan.
Relations between China and Japan, the two largest economies in Asia, have recently become tense as more and more Chinese naval and other government vessels sail near the disputed islands in the East China Sea (known by Japan as the Senkaku Islands and by China as the Diaoyu Islands).
Police sources: two suspects arrested for conspiracy against the Rio Olympics.
The police arrested two men on Thursday who were suspected of planning an attack that might have taken place during the Rio Olympics because of their support for the Islamic State.
The police arrested 12 people during an operation on Thursday who were suspected of collaborating with Islamic State militants.
According to the Brazilian Federal Police, three others were released after interrogation.
The two men arrested on Thursday were of Brazilian nationality, but the police did not provide their names or other details.
Although there is no record of any conflict with known armed groups in Brazil's history, the Government has indicated that the Olympic Games have made Brazil a potentially target, especially in countries that are fighting the Islamic State every year.
The Islamic State armed elements controlled parts of Iraq and Syria, and the United States-led coalition carried out air strikes against them.
Proponents of the group spread around the world, carrying out shootings and bombings against civilians.
New suspects in the murder of a French pastor have been formally prosecuted.
Police sources told Reuters on Friday that a French priest had been murdered last month and that, as part of the investigation into the case, an official investigation had been opened into a man arrested on Monday.
According to the source, the 21-year-old suspect was accused of collaborating with terrorists and planning attacks on the population.
The man had telephone contact with Adel Kermić and Abdou Lemalek Padijan, who broke into a church ceremonial site and cut the throat of 85-year-old Roman Catholic priest Jacques Hammer on 26 July in the town of San Etienne de Rufre, in western France.
Both were killed by the police.
According to the source, a few days before the attack, the suspect had travelled from his home near Toulouse to the town of San Eti Andufre and spent the night there.
According to the source, the young man had no criminal record and he admitted having spent the night there, but told the investigators that he left the next day because he had no relationship with Adel and Abdou.
Investigators are trying to determine whether Kelmichat and Paddy Jean are complicit in France, and whether they have any links to ISIL militants, who claimed responsibility for the attack.
A cousin of Paddyan was also taken into preventive custody at the end of last month.
Dorus de Fries has been medically examined to go to the Celtic Football Club.
The Nottingham Forest Football Club door has arrived in Glasgow to complete the transfer to the Celtic Football Club.
A photo was taken of Fries entering Rosehall Hospital for a medical examination before the Celtic Football Club agreed to the terms of the Sky Bet Championship Club.
The Celtic Football Club owner, Brandon Rogers, is looking for an experienced door to meet the challenge of George Gordon, currently ranked number one.
Rogers, however, had faith in the 35-year-old Friss, and he worked well with this Dutchman at the Swanstown Football Club.
Fries played 51 times for the Swanstown Football Club, and in 2011 they made the British Super League, led by Rogers.
In the summer of the same year, he joined the Wolves from Swansea and served in Mantown since 2013.
As early as 2006, he signed up for a season at the Dumblewood Football Club and had experience in Scotland.
His experience at the Downtown Park Fields ended with disappointment, but the Dumblewoods were not alone and lost to the Celtics in the finals of the Scottish Grand Cup after being demoted from the highest level.
The doorman's contract with the Nottingham Forest Football Club is due to expire in one year, and the Celtics are reported to be paying only a symbolic fee to get him to join.
The security of the Rio Olympics outside the arena has always been a concern, and this morning there was another bomb shock before the men's basket game.
The OMC confirmed that prior to the start of the male basketball competition in Spain and Nigeria, a suspicious backpack found in the basketball court was detonated in a controlled manner by the police and the military.
According to Reuters, a security officer said the backpack could have been found after the match in Brazil and Croatia.
According to a statement from a spokesman for the O.C., the police found a suspicious backpack in a garbage bin in the bathroom.
The backpack was then removed by a robot and detonated under the direction of the police and the military.
The statement also mentioned: "A tablet computer, a pair of socks and a jacket were found in the backpack."
When the Spanish-Nigerian game started, there were no fans on the field, and they didn't get in until the police confirmed their safety.
"We heard the explosion, but we didn't know what it was.
At first, we just heard explosions and looked around, but we saw nothing wrong. "
Before that, there was a threat of a suspected bomb at the Rio Olympic men's road cycle, and the bomb disposal unit detonated the suspect package near the finish line.
Summers are hot and hot, young children's skin problems are increasing, and their emergence is closely related to how sweaty they are.
As long as the temperature's high, it's the start of a lot of parents' nightmares, kids' skin itches, rashes, red spots, etc., always scratching and crying at night.
Tan Xiaohua, paediatrician at the third hospital attached to Guangzhou Medical School, observes that every summer, the proportion of children with small illnesses in outpatient clinics rises, mosquito bites, wet rashes, hot larvae, diaper rashes, etc.
Despite the causes, the symptoms are the same. They're rashes, red spots, and itchy.
In fact, the causes of these skin diseases are the same, because kids don't have enough cleanness, sweat, saliva, and they don't dry in time.
According to Dr. Tan Xiaohua, a kid's skin is softer than an adult's skin, and he's hot and sweaty.
In addition, the children's sweat glands are developing, and some children's sweat glands and skin glands are not evenly balanced and there's a problem of sweating out.
"Some parents get used to it, wear a little towel, see the kid sweat, and dry him off. "
" And the clothes are wet and sweaty, and skin rashes are often seen on him. "
If the summer is too hot and the baby sweats, parents can increase the frequency of showers and then get him dry clothes.
One bath a day, for example, can now be increased once, but the additional bath can only be flushed without the bathing.
In addition, the prevention of summer skin diseases can be used to drip some herbal herbal components into the baby's bath water, which has components such as gold and silver, which can help to evacuate the pores and help to sweat.
The above basic homework to protect the skin parents of the baby, for different skin diseases, can also be used by the parents in the following different ways.
But it's important to remind you that if there's a rash or a relapse, it's recommended that we take care of it and see if there's any other disease.

Some countries or parts of some countries have reported a decrease in the number of cases of silovirus infection, but the evidence available at this stage shows no signs of a decrease in the total silo outbreak.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), although there have been imported cases of silovirus in mainland China, local transmission from mosquitoes to humans has not yet been detected.
The President of the Philippines, Duttert, said on the 12th that he had called the United States Ambassador to Fiji, Philip Goldberg, but would not apologize to Goldberg.
The United States Embassy in the Philippines issued a statement on 12 December stating that the United States side had taken note of the reports of criticism of Godggard, which was "inappropriate and unacceptable".
In April of this year, during the Philippine presidential election campaign, Gothenburg accused Dootelt of human rights issues, and the two sides continued to speak and clashed.
On August 12th, Beijing, the Spanish male basket defeated Nigeria with 96-87 and saw a glimmer of hope.
Augusti's 12 out of seven, two out of three, 24 out of three, Acononon 12, 5 baskets, and Ibeckwie 11, 5 baskets.
As a traditional European force, Spain has been forced into a difficult situation because of the lack of Major General Mark Gassol's strength, and it is not easy even to get out of the team.
In the face of Nigeria, the weakest opponent in this group, Spain fought very hard and barely managed to get through it at the last minute.
Nigeria failed to score at the end of the section at 1 minute and 20 seconds, with Rodríguez in three points, Spain in five, leading by 25-11.
In the second section, three minutes and 54 seconds, Gassol takes the basket, and Spain still takes the lead on 40-27.
In six minutes and nine seconds of this section, out of two of Loure's punishments, Spain regained its double-digit advantage by 61-48.
After Augusti scored three points, Spain scored four points in a row, increasing the advantage to 14.
But at the last four minutes and 49 seconds of this section, Spain was unable to score another score, and the flowers were blooming in and out of Nigeria, ending the section with a wave of 13-0 and exceeding it by 66-65, the first time they were in the lead.
Nigeria's hit three in two in this wave, and one out of three is causing a foul.
In three minutes and 49 seconds, after Aminu took the basket, Nigeria pursued a score of 79-81.
After three points in the August kill, Nigeria narrowed the gap to one, Reyes and Gasor scored six points in a row, leading by 89-82 in 1 minute and 15 seconds of the game.
In the 22nd round of the China Super League, which took place on the night of August 12 Beijing time, Beijing's Guangan National Park 1-2 took over the Chongqing sail.
After a moment of adjustment at the scene, Dabao returned to the scene, but the trouble didn't really go away, and he was replaced by Song Bo-chun at the 76th minute because he couldn't hold on.
Even more disturbing is the fact that Dabao is no longer able to move, that he was carried by a stretcher, where he was treated for almost 10 minutes, and was then taken directly to the ambulance.
When it comes to the "national foot", Dabao's injury would have affected the country's 12 best races in half a month.
This week, during the round-up of the Chinese Ang Hak Mok, Taibao and Paolino were injured, and he and he both fell in the middle of a fierce fight, causing a neck injury.
The serious injury that occurred in the race was more touching, and conservatively it was estimated that it would take four months to recover, meaning that he would be absent from at least the first half of the 12 competitions.
If Daebao's injuries are too much trouble, the configuration of the country's candidates will be greatly affected.
However, engineers at the University of California at Berkeley took the concept one step further by developing very small wireless sensors to detect health conditions in the human body.
The researchers described their inventions in the neural magazine published on August 3rd.
Not only that, these sensors don't need batteries, they can be used to stimulate nerves and muscles.
This could provide a way to treat disorders such as epilepsy or activate the human immune system.
The device has been implanted into the muscles and the end nerve of the rat and uses ultrasound as a source of energy and reading the collected data.
Sensors have been reduced to a cubic millimetre called "Neurodust", which contains a voltage crystal.
The author of this paper explains that the crystal transforms ultrasound from the human body to the power of a tiny transistor in the drive, which is directly connected to a nerve or muscle fiber.
The peak of voltage in the fibres causes changes in current circuits and crystal vibrations, so that the echoes detected by ultrasound receivers (currently the main source of ultrasonic vibrations).
Since ultrasound technology is very common in hospitals and ultrasound can penetrate most bodies, it looks like a natural choice.
Michel Maharbiz is an associate professor of electronic engineering and computer science at the University of California in Berkeley.
As co-author of the paper, he said in a statement, "I don't think the long-term outlook for neurodust is confined to the nerves and brain, but it's much broader... "
Maharbiz co-led the study with his colleagues and Jose Carmena, a neuroscientist at the University of California in Berkeley.
He explained, "It was never possible to use internal telemetry because it was impossible to place a super-small object in a very deep place.
But now, I can pick up a tiny object, put it in a nerve or organ, next to the digestive tract or muscle, and read the data... "
In order to test their device, Maharbiz and Caarmena used six 540 nm ultrasonic pulses per 100 ms to drive the sensor.
But researchers are confident that they will also work in the brain and central nervous system.
The Neurodust project was originally designed to depict the next generation of brain exchange interactions and make them a viable clinical technology ... "
"If a paralysing patient wishes to control a computer or a mechanical arm, you can implant the electrode into the brain, where it can work for life. "
Two shots work at the same time, so that we can distinguish the obvious back and forth and produce a more shallow view.
Not only did the Kumamoto earthquake shake Japan's native territory, but even the world's digital camera core industry chain broke.
Since the earthquake, Sony's Japanese factory has lost a lot of money, and the current state of the global digital camera is a shortage of goods and an increase in prices.
Sony developed sensors that were used almost for all cameras, and without their availability, the cameras could not naturally be produced.
According to recent information, Sony is currently raising nearly $3.6 billion in stocks and bonds for research and development and production of stacked CMOS.
As long as it's a sensor, it's gonna depend on Sony, whether digital cameras or mobile smart devices.
I'd like Sonny to return to normal sensor supply more than the news of the new format, but the price of the camera is really hard to see.
Macy's gonna shut down 100 stores.
On Thursday, the department store giant Macy said that the company was planning to close 100 stores, a major initiative aimed at helping the chain out of a potentially serious problem: the company claimed that there were too many physical stores in the United States in the age of shopping on the Internet.
Macy regularly adjusts the sub-platforms and closes dozens of underperforming shops after the annual vacation peak.
In a summer announcement, however, the company announced that 15 per cent of 728 stores under its flag would be closed down. The chain appears to be taking a more radical stance than many retail counterparts, reducing the size of the shop to respond to the rapidly changing shopping environment in reality.
The pedestrians and the shoppers walk in front of a Macy department store in New York.
The retail giant said he was planning to shut down 100 stores.
Macy had many reasons to try to change: many of the stores under the company were located in small, regional shopping malls, where the flow of people had been severely damaged by the rise of e-commerce.
Moreover, as shoppers become increasingly inclined to go to discount retailers (e.g. T.J. Maxx) and fast-fashion companies (e.g. H&M) to buy their clothing, the retail type of department stores is generally in a difficult position.
These factors, combined with short-term problems (e.g. the decline in international tourist consumption and the untimely weather), have caused Macy's department stores to experience a difficult period of more than a year.
On Thursday, the company stated that comparative sales had declined by 2.6 per cent in the last quarter and had weak performance, although it had improved in comparison with the previous quarter ' s poor performance, which had fallen by 6.1 per cent.
The retailer earned $5.87 billion ($7.64 billion), a 3.9 per cent decrease from the same period in the previous year.
Macy's department stores suggest that the closure of these stores could reduce annual sales by about $1 billion.
In the past, the closure of such a large number of shops may have been seen as a compromise by retailers for failing to operate.
However, the firm’s stock surge of 17 per cent on Thursday shows that investors see this as a positive move that heralds a stronger performance of Merci’s department stores in the future.
In some ways, Massey's cuts shouldn't be a surprise.
The CEO of Macy's department store, Terry Lundgren, once said the chain was just too many stores.
Senior management has been saying for some time that they are developing a strategy that focuses on some 150 of the best-performing shops, trying to squeeze out more sales in those good-performing locations.
In a statement, Méxie department executive Jeff Ginet, who will replace Lundgren as CEO in 2017, stated that all the stores that the company plans to close were those whose sales and profits had been declining.
Ginette said, "We acknowledge that the returns on investments in these locations are insufficient and often fail to demonstrate the customer shopping experience we expect of the Merci brand representative. "
The company said it would provide a list of the stores that would be closed down.
Macy's department stores stated that the company was still making a final decision as to which shops to shut down, so it was not yet possible to determine precisely how many jobs would be cut.
The retailer will not withdraw completely from any of the top-class malls in which existing stores operate, but will seek to close down those that are in underperforming locations.
This may not be good news for mall operators, who rely on large tenants like Macy's to attract and keep other smaller shops operating in malls.
Did you hide dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to new research, drinking from water bottles that can refill water may be worse in many cases than adding to your dog's toys in terms of the amount of bacteria you'll be exposed to.
EmLab P&K was commissioned to test 12 water bottles of four different types (including rotting, slide, squeeze and straw cover).
Every water bottle is used by an athlete for a week without cleaning.
Your refillable bottle could be as dirty as a dog's toy.
According to Treadmill Reviews: " On the basis of the 12 water bottles tested, we find reusable drinking water containers capable of harbouring an alarming number of living bacterial cells: more than 300,000 units per centimetre (CFU) form. "
The test found the highest bacterial content in the slide-cap water bottle, with an average of more than 900,000 units of cm2.
The bottlecap contains Gelanc positive fungus, which can cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood poisoning.
The next is a squeezed-covered water bottle, with 162,000 units per square centimetre of bacteria forming, and a rotating water bottle with a bacterial number close to 160,000 CFUs per square centimetre.
The site adds: "Drinking water with these bottles may be worse than eating with your pet's plate."
The test results for the suction cap water bottle have been much better, containing much smaller bacteria than those of other water bottles, with only 25 CFUs per square centimetre.
It's probably because the water reaches the bottom of the straw instead of staying in the bottle to attract the humid bacteria.
Bacteria in suction cap bottles are described as "normally harmless".
The site says: "By the results of the tests, we recommend the use of straw-covered water bottles, which have a low prevalence of bacteria and a low number of harmful bacteria. "
We also learned that stainless steel bottles are a better choice than plastic bottles in terms of water bottles and bacteria.
In addition, water bottles without cracks and difficult to clean are less likely to be bacterial hosts.
The site suggests that readers wash water bottles every time they're used, and the preferred method is to wash them with a weak bleaching solution.
Religions have to be modernized or they're going to have to be eliminated.
The U.S. Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the latest poll results remain unchanged at the time of the election, the first female president in American history will be sworn in in January.
Last week, across the Atlantic, British Prime Minister Teresa May was negotiating with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the terms of British withdrawal from the European Union.
Women living in Western societies have grown up to believe that they are capable and successful in any professional role through education, ambition and hard work.
Today, young women can use as their role models some living people who work at the highest levels of leadership.
So, has the long and hard struggle for equal rights for women finally ended?
Hillary Clinton is waiting to be elected President of the United States, but female leadership remains a controversial issue in the religious sphere.
Well, it's not completely over.
Women's leadership remains a controversial issue in the religious sphere.
Last week, Pope Francis announced the formation of a new committee to consider whether women should be appointed as dean of the Catholic Church.
In January 2015, the Anglican Church appointed Libby Lane as its first bishop, and in 2012 a similar attempt ended in failure.
Although the Jewish Reform Movement has appointed female rabbis since the early 1970s, the conservative movement has emerged since the 1980s, and there is still a heated debate over the idea of female rabbis in Orthodox Judaism.
In November 2015, the American Orthodox Jewish Council issued a solemn communiqué declaring the illegality of the female rabbi, the third attempt of the Council to resist the growing trend in favour of Orthodox women in the Lirabi position.
It is ironic that, just as Hillary Clinton accepted the nomination of a candidate for President of the Democratic Party, a group of US orthodox rabbis opposed to female sanctities launched a series of "hearings" on this controversial subject.
Why is there such a gap between secular and religious fields?
Like most sects, orthodox Judaism seeks to stabilize what it considers to be a continuation of traditional values.
This is reflected in resistance to the pressures of adapting societies.
Those who oppose it are based on the fact that a woman's position as a priest is not in line with tradition.
But it's not cost-free to stick to tradition in this way.
The price of fidelity may deprive the traditional community of the oxygen on which it depends, thereby destroying the tradition itself against its will.
In the World War I military history book, "August Guns", Barbara Tachman highlighted the dangers of tradition through history known as the tragedy of red pants.
On the eve of the First World War, as the war evolved from close combat to heavy artillery fire from further distance, soldiers could take advantage of hiding for as long as possible.
In response to this change, the British and German armies have replaced the coloured uniform with a single-tone grey and brown uniform.
However, the same red hat and pants were still used by the French soldiers and became a very visible target on the battlefield.
The French army minister Adolf Mejimi's proposal to have his troops do the same was mocked and rejected.
The red pants represent the honour and prestige of the army, and the military traditionalists do not intend to give it up.
At a parliamentary hearing, former Army Minister Eugene Etienne gave a speech to France.
He yelled, "Get rid of the red pants?"
Never!
Mehimi later wrote: "The blind and foolish attachment to the most visible colours brings cruel consequences."
Religious leaders who resist female religious leadership are at risk of the same trap.
They focus on their religion's "traditional practices" rather than asking themselves the crucial question: "What changes are needed to keep religion alive?" Their risk is to alienate 50% of the population.
They also make it possible for entire communities to exclude the talents, skills and enthusiasm that women can contribute.
In terms of religion, it may be tradition to insist that men continue to wear those pants, but it may not be worthwhile, as revealed by the tragic loss of red pants.
Dena Bauer is the founder of the British Orthodox Feminist League and a Orthodox Rabbi at the Jewish School "Yeshivat Maharat" in New York.
Charlton Competition fans only get season tickets if they sign a contract of conduct and agree not to denigrate the club on social media.
While we recognize the right of everyone to hold their own personal views, it is not helpful to post inflammatory statements on social networking sites.
The executive fan was then told to go personally to the former chief of police, Cliff Eagle, who joined the club last month after 35 years of police career.
The letter goes on to say, "I need to remind you that you will be given a `conditional' to award tickets for the season, and you will have to sign a `contract of contractual conduct', which requires you to refrain in the future from posting derogatory or inflammatory statements against members of this club or club ' s representative on any social media website and from any other act that may be considered anti-social in nature. "
The fan described to the Daily Telegraph how he bought season tickets and then called the club, but two days later the ticket didn't show up, but he received this letter.
When he went to the club yesterday, he said, "They told me that my tweets have always been extreme and influenced the tweets of others, which I find absurd. "
A holiday ride off the Dalmatian coast.
What do you mean, luxury?
The former U.S. Navy commander Collin said, "I'm riding my ass off." "She's just completed a 25-mile bike ride along the rugged Croatian Ridge, leaving a lot of sweating and a string of naval screams in the face of a difficult mountain.
Some cyclists hum their hymns or recite their children's songs distract themselves during the difficult climbs.
Colleen's friend Patty suggested humming "The Truck did it."
The others are counting in circles or suffering in silence, trying to figure out how to get into what the seasoned riders call a state of discomfort.
Corinne cursed it in every vicious way.
Riding a few yards ahead of her is like being chased by Hugh Grant in the "Four Marriages and a Funeral" section.
She and I were tasked with a week-long cruise of luxurious cruises and bicycles on the shores and islands of Dalmatia in northern Croatia, organized by Freedom Treks.
While cycling may not be a luxury concept for all in places as steep as Croatia, it is said that northern Dalmatia is easier to ride than southern. We used soft cushions. When we filled out the reservation forms with careless and confidentness a few months ago, there was a check box that would ensure that we could be assisted with an electric bike, but we didn't.
The extravagant part of the deal is that we'll be living in our floating home for a week, that's the brand-new melody cruiser.
At the end of the ride, we can dump our bikes at the docks, where Ivan and Ivana, our guides, can pack them. Then we jump out of the back of the cruise ship into the blue sea, where the sea is clear, and it's easy to distinguish between sea urchins, sharp rocks and other travellers, a place that the Croats call the beach full of long strips of pedals.
This seawater is the best temperature at the end of June, and we all agree: it's cold enough, but it's not cold enough.
If anyone feels energetic after a hard ride in the morning, then the melody cruiser is equipped with a mask, a breathing tube and a few kayaks.
But most of us would rather go back to the air-conditioning cabin, and Helena, the masseuse on board, would have laid our bed, filled up the food in the fridge and left a new box of chocolate on the table.
Ivan says it's important to do stretching after a bike ride. We practice stretching in the afternoon on our own bed or on the top deck cushion couch. Bartender Antonio is ready to offer the cocktail he set up.
The melody cruiser is not a superior super tanker, but a stylish little cruiser, 42 metres long, with 15 cabins and half a dozen crews.
In all the fishing boats and holiday cruises in the ports of small islands, she was remarkable, and we were very proud to be a part of the ship.
Colleen and Patty came from a group of friends from a website called Meetup.com, Washington, D.C.: they called themselves "Sports and Societies 45+".
Last year, when the barge and bicycle holidays were successfully organized in the Netherlands, they decided to try more risky activities, and now they're in Croatia.
A small church competing with their church is on a cruise ship and bicycle holiday in Provence, and every afternoon on Facebook you come to me to make the competition more exciting.
The risk element in the holiday may be exaggerated, because without strict regulation, we will not be able to keep up with the schedule.
As we sailed from the glamorous old port of Trogil near Split, Ivan announced at the welcome meeting to the first arrivals: "Break and dinner are scheduled at 8:00."
One bell on the boat means the buffet begins, and one more bell after the meal says please be quiet and listen carefully to the next briefing.
"Good moving" has been forgotten by all but the British.
Ivana gave us a map of the day, and we all pretended to be convoluted around it, and the shades and rises and drops were terrified, but everything else would be a surprise for a cycling trip from the coast to the coast in Croatia.
Ivan said, "It's like an EKG. "
The completely flat route is not within the recommended range.
Ivan has been briefed frequently in English and German.
For weeks, he's dealt with tourists from a dozen countries, but we're easy people (Swiss, Germans, Americans and British), two tables for the English and one for the German.
Everyone's been a good friend on the way.
Friendship increases in riding, and the only contestant is the landscape, which means self-competing.
It's the most harmonious, relaxed group activity I've ever had.
We'll be moving to Ivan's wavelength soon.
The hard-to-crawl section means a ramp up, not confused with the up and down, which is easier.
The hairband refers to a twisting section, while the straight-way segment means a straight ride: simple, but not always easy.
Ride commands are always the same: "One column, keep your distance, it's not a game."
We'll meet at the docks at 9:00.
Well, then 9:05. I forgot you guys were on vacation.
It's gonna take a lot of water.
We started a two-day cruise from Trogill northward through the Konati Islands, where we ride a long way along Dugi Otok, and then wake up and walk around Traska Nature Park, enjoying the steep cliffs and the salt lakes formed by the seawater coming in from underground passages.
It's said that swimming in this lake can rejuvenate people.
If we move forward, will our feet get younger and stronger?
On a small island called Morat, we're going south again, improvising between the land and the nearby islands.
Most of our rides are rural open roads along open seascapes and various kinds of fruit and vegetables: olive gardens, vineyards and thorns; the smell of the Mediterranean in the air, and the wings of countless butterflies.
There's always a breeze on the road ahead, but the shades are precious, and Ivan stops the motorcade in such a place, and a cool little pool is a reward for early riders.
This sport and social group organises a lot of group bicycles on weekends, they learn about the rituals, they give all kinds of reminders on the way, and they give way on the ride so that the car driver can move beyond it more safely.
When a truck tried to overwhelm a dead corner with an emergency brake, one rider said to another rider, "You almost hit your head."
Fortunately, they passed safely.
Ivan has divided us into three groups, with Ivana on the last of the crew, as Ivan said, "River up."
When we have to cross the main road, we gather together, get out of the car and walk, push the bike to the other side of the safe zone, and act as instructed and do not make our own claims.
As we stood by the road waiting for instructions to cross, a Swiss rider asked, "Do you think Ivan realizes he's not giving orders to a bunch of kids?"
Our afternoons aren't always free.
During the city trip to Zadar, we visited the Roman Forum ruins and the sea-wave organ, which produced music like the sea monster moaning in a cage, and the sound of music came out by opening pipes to the sea, which were set up in a stone-coded corridor.
When we're finished eating pudding, it's a wonderful time to enjoy Zadar's famous sunset scene. After dusk, we return to the surf organ, and we enjoy the surf-painted sidewalks that generate light, like the ground is dancing.
When the melody sailed early in the morning to a popular resort in Belgrade, the sound of the waves was like a whisper in the ear.
The fifth day is a free ride.
Walking by boat into the mouth of the Kelka River to see its waterfalls; visiting the dome cathedral in Hibenik in the afternoon, a masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance; walking in the quiet evening of Zlarin, looking for endemic corals — we had a very interesting day.
Lourdes is ready to meet pilgrims despite the threat of attack.
People gather at Notre Dame Lourdes during the annual Catholic pilgrimage.
With thousands of Catholics gathered for the annual pilgrimage at Notre Dame Lourdes, the French security forces were on high alert because of the recent series of terrorist attacks.
August 15th is the day the Virgin Mary is called to the sky, and every year tens of thousands of people gather in holy places in the Pyrenees to commemorate the Holy Day of the Virgin.
At the dawn of this year's pilgrimage, Catholicism was adversely affected by the murder of a French senior priest, who was broken into and slit his throat by two Islamist extremists during mass on 26 July.
Two weeks before the murder of Father Jacques Hammer, a Tunisian (who, according to investigators, had become an extremist because of the web-based Islamic Jihad video) drove a truck into the French National Day celebrations in the coastal city of Nice, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks in 18 months, many French now have concerns about participating in public gatherings.
In France, the number of visitors entering the country has dropped sharply, and the authorities are already concerned that the number of visitors to the pilgrimage will drop sharply this year.
However, the fear of a mass cancellation has not materialized, and some organizers have indicated a surge in numbers at the following moment.
It is expected that there will be some 25,000 believers, including Masses from Italy and Belgium, and a delegation of some 200 members of the Christian branch Orthodox Church.
Many pilgrims say they won't be afraid.
A 66-year-old tourist, Christian, said to Agence France-Presse, "We won't stop living." "He says praying in front of the windfall is the only weapon."
One of the coordinators, Mathieu Giniar, said, "It's important to show that life continues."
We can't give up our faith, our faith and our way of life because some fanatics are trying to spread fear.
Since the attacks in Nice, France has cancelled a number of major events for security reasons, including the large flea market in the northern city of Lille and the European Road Bicycling Championship scheduled for September in Nice.
The pastor in charge of official pilgrimages last weekend, Fabian Lejón, said, "In the past week, I was worried about getting a call for cancellations. "
He stated, however, that the attack seemed to have mobilized the believers and that the number of persons scheduled had surged at the last minute.
Christian Grace, head of the local hotel union, confirmed that there were signs of "a growing will" to go to the pilgrimage after the attack.
The security of the sanctuary built around the temple has been significantly strengthened, and it is now known that in 1858 the Virgin Mary had sanctified the poor shepherd, Benedette Supiru, in the caves of the Holy Land.
Some 250 police and dozens of soldiers (including bomb disposal specialists and officers with sniffing dogs) have been deployed to protect the region.
Pilgrims queuing through the security zone need to be searched by parcel at the entrance to the scene, where the original dozens of tunnels were reduced to three.
Catherine Simcock, who left northeast of England earlier this month for Ludh, described the strengthening of security.
She told the local newspaper: "Thursday morning, armed guards were deployed in the holy places, and then the gate (using metal barriers) was set up in a single row to enter and the parcels were searched during the entrance. "
She said, "It makes my three kids very nervous and scared, they know Lourdes very well, and it's hard not to scare them when they ask why they are so heavily guarded."
It didn't ruin my experience, but it made me sad that it was necessary, and I understand that these measures reassured some.
Friday's opening marches were also shortened, with the departure for the Holy Land in Lourdes, and now the starting and ending sites are located in Notre Dame.
Other measures include the closure of the city of Lourdes airspace, the banning of flights, the blocking of traffic in the streets around the holy sites and the replacement of garbage cans with transparent plastic bags.
The French Minister of the Interior, Bernard Kazenaf, will conduct a security inspection on Saturday.
Lourdes attracts about 6 million people to the pilgrimage every year, one of the largest Catholic pilgrimage sites in the world.
Many visitors also brought sick or disabled relatives to bathe in the caves of the Virgin Mary claimed to have been seen in Bernadette and believed that the water was therapeutic.
As one of the organizers, Thierry Castillo thinks this year's rally is "a little unusual," because "intimidation seems to have taken root in France."
However, he was sure to say, "This will not affect the quality and depth of the pilgrimage experience. "
The 58-year-old volunteer Françoise was helping the sick pilgrims, and she admitted that the soldiers who were dressed in camouflage were a little too many.
But it's just so long as it's reassuring.
Two people were injured in the shooting at the Zaragoza mall
One man shot at a shopping mall in the north-eastern Spanish city of Zaragoza, causing serious injuries to two men.
Friday morning, at 11 a.m., the incident took place at the flowering Atagonia Business Center in Zaragoza.
According to preliminary reports, the shooter may have hit a woman, believed to be his former partner.
The shooter escaped after the murder, and the police are in pursuit.
Turkey's search for a diplomat who disappeared after the attempted coup
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who could not be called back to Turkey after the attempted coup d'état of 15 July.
On Friday, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that 208 Turkish Foreign Ministry staff had been recalled from around the globe to Ankara in connection with the investigation of the attempted coup, and that 32 were "unauthorized" and unaccounted for.
There are about 18,000 public servants in Turkey, military leaders and academics who have been arrested or suspended from their duties as loyal to Fatura Grant in the United States and accused Fatura Grant of plotting to overthrow the government.
Grant, now based in Pennsylvania, is a wanted criminal in Turkey.
Chavushoğlu indicated that a working group of the United States Department of Justice would visit Turkey later this month to discuss the possibility of extraditing Grant.
This issue has become an obstacle to bilateral relations between the United States and Turkey (NATO member states).
The United States opposes the iron-handed policy of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the aftermath of the coup d'état, and Turkey's response is an attempt to develop closer relations with Russia.
Chavushoğlu stated that two Turkish military officers in Greece had fled to Italy, that one military officer in Kuwait had tried to flee to Saudi Arabia but had been repatriated, and that two Generals in Afghanistan had been captured in Dubai and repatriated.
He added that two officials in Bangladesh fled to New York, while one in Russia went to Japan.
The newspaper Daily Hurryiet of Ankara quoted military sources as saying that Turkish military attachés in Jordan were also missing.
The Wall Street Journal quoted an American official who was aware of the situation as saying that a Turkish officer stationed at NATO Command Centre in Virginia had requested asylum from the United States.
Some have absconded.
"Some of our diplomats have absconded." Chavuss Oulu said in an interview to the Turkish television station NTV.
As of yesterday, the time limit had expired for the first recall.
We will take legal action against those who have not yet returned.
Olympic organizers are trying to clean the green pool.
When they arrived on Friday, the Olympic jumpers who planned to practice had discovered that the ponds had been closed because Olympic organizers had spent a lot of time cleaning up a small pool of green water to prepare for the first individual competition of the upcoming Rio Games.
The pool suddenly changed color when the double diving project was held on Tuesday.
After a little greening of the larger pool adjacent to the waterball and swam competition, the organizers maintained that the pool water was safe for the competition.
When the athletes arrived to prepare for the morning warm-up exercise, the diving pool was shut down, although it was re-opened at 1 p.m. local time, two and a half hours before the women's 3-metre-board diving competition began.
The color of the pool looks like it's normal, but it's still a little green.
The American diver Abby Johnston at the Jumpboard Project said she was going to the pool for a warm-up exercise when she learned that the pool had been shut down without any advance notice.
She wrote on Twitter that #FixTheSwamp should start projecting trends.
Tom Daley, a British player who won the double-dumping competition, also commented on the status of the pool on Twitter.
I hope that means we won't dive in a bad pool for the next few days!
Mario Andrada, the chief spokesman of the local competition organizing committee, stressed that the pool was safe for the competition and that there was no problem with the 3-metre pre-game.
He admitted that some athletes were worried about the pool, but said it was due to cleaning of the pool.
He said, "We repeat our long-standing claim that this pool does not pose any threat to the health of athletes. "
One or two athletes complained about itching their eyes on the day of the pool.
That's because the first reaction when we see the pool turn green is the use of chemical chlorine, which is common in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced our usage.
We retested the pool, and the results show that the indicators are completely within the parameters.
Simon Langford, the chief spokesman for the Marialenko swimming centre, said that the diving pool had been closed to perform additional cleaning work.
He said the decision was supported by the International Swimming Union.
In a statement, Langford said, "The reason for closing the diving pool is that it must remain static so that it can return to its blue state as soon as possible. "
Andrada said the organizers were too surprised by the deterioration of the pool.
He said, "Chemical is not an exact science."
As you can see, there are things that last longer than expected.
The rain of the last few days has made it even more difficult to restore the colour of the pool.
Andrada said, "It won't help to improve the situation. "
He added that athletes could train on land in the morning, but admitted that the arrangement was not ideal.
He explained that the colouring of the pool was due to increased alkalinity, similar to the possible greening of water in aquariums without proper monitoring.
When we went to solve the problem of greening the pool, there was a discussion about the best chemical substances.
Andrada says, "The athletes are training in the pool, so we can't use too much chemicals in the water."
Of course, we should have done better at the beginning to keep the pool green.
When the pool turned green, we made another mistake.

The forum will be held in Shanghai and Taipei despite the stagnation of communication mechanisms between the two sides of the Strait
On Friday, the Shanghai City Department announced that the Shanghai and Taipei cities would hold an annual city forum in Taipei on 22 and 23 August, despite the current stagnation of communication mechanisms between the two sides of the Straits.
The Shanghai City Government announced, through the official blog account in Xinjiang Weibo, that Shakhailin, a senior municipal official, would head a delegation to the forum on behalf of Yang, the Mayor of Shanghai.
Since its inception in 2010, the Forum has been organized by the two cities on a rotational basis.
According to the Shanghai Municipality, the forum in 2016 will focus on exchanges in areas such as health care, smart cities, culture and transport, thus "deepening communication and cooperation" between the two cities.
Since Taiwan's new leader, Zai Zai English, took office in May, Taiwan's refusal to recognize the 92nd Consensus, based on the one-China principle, has led to the breakdown of the mechanisms of communication and consultation between the two sides.
On Friday, the spokesman for the Taiwan Office of the State Council stated that cross-Strait relations would maintain peace as long as the Taiwan side maintained the political basis of the 92nd Consensus.
Ma Xiaogang stressed the need to correctly interpret the nature of cross-Straits relations and urban exchanges, saying: "We are positive and open to cross-Straits urban exchanges. "
The President of Uganda met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of China and looked forward to enhanced cooperation
On Thursday, the President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, in his meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, Wang Yi, expressed his gratitude to China for its long-standing support for the development of Uganda and expressed the hope that bilateral cooperation would be enhanced.
Mr. Museveni stated that China was an old friend of Uganda and Africa and that, in the process of liberation of Africa against colonialism, China had fought alongside Africa and, later, had supported Africa's economic and social development.
The President cited the Tanzan Railway, built in the 1970s, as proof of China's generous support, when China itself was not even prosperous.
Museveni stated that China and Uganda had cooperated in many ways, from infrastructure development to business investment to cultural exchange. He added that such cooperation was more conducive to Uganda’s long-term development than simply providing assistance.
He hoped that China could participate in infrastructure development and industrial parks in Uganda in various ways.
He also welcomed more Chinese to Uganda for investment and tourism.
Wang Yi praised Uganda for its progress in industrialization and agricultural modernization and stated that China would remain Uganda's most reliable and ideal partner.
Wang Yi stated that China was ready to do its utmost to help Uganda pursue economic and social development, stressing that China-UU cooperation was sincere and free of any political conditions, since it was based on a high level of political mutual trust and long-term friendship.
He said that China would strengthen its cooperation with Uganda in infrastructure and industrial parks and support energy and agricultural development in the East African countries.
