Between 1 January and 15 March 2020, the cumulative incidence of new types of coronary virus disease in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (COVID-19) increased rapidly.
In the EU/EEA countries, as well as in the UK, the cumulative incidence of the new coronary virus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend, confirming that while different countries are at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly.
According to Italian experience, the country, hospitals and intensive care units need to be better prepared to deal with the surge in the number of COVID-19 patients, and the task of intensive care is particularly important.
On December 31, 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, reported several cases of pneumonia with unknown causes.
On 9 January 2020, the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control of China reported that the pathogen is a new type of coronary virus and is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections have been named coronary virus diseases (COVID-19).
The evidence so far shows that about 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, i.e. respiratory infections associated with or not associated with pneumonia, and most of them are recovered.
Of the approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses in critical conditions and requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% progresses in critical conditions and requires intensive care.
Inpatient mortality due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed trends in the cumulative incidence of the European/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and COVID-19 in the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with Hubei Province of China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020 with Italy.
EU/EA Country and UK Cases COVID-19
After China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded, and the current dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to those in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the European Monitor magazine published on March 5, 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe based on the WHO case definition.
In EU/EA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on January 24th, 2020, of returnees from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
By March 15, 2020, all 30 EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom had detected COVID-19 cases, and from December 31 to March 15, 2019, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, of which Italy alone had reported 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Accumulation and incidence of obtaining COVID-19 cases
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country around the world at 8 a.m. each morning, accessible only from official sources, such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data have been used to assess trends in EU/EA and COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and to compare them with Italy.
We calculated the cumulative incidence of the 14-day transhipment of each EU/EA country and COVID-19 case between 1 January and 15 March 2020, as an indicator of the incidence of active COVID-19 cases, in order to take into account the natural pathology of COVID-19.
We also provide the total number of cumulative cases reported by each country up to 8 a.m. on March 15th, 2020 and compare the data for Italy from January 31st to March 15th, 2020.
EU/EA National and UK COVID-19 Trends
The trends in the 14-day condensed cumulative incidence of the 14-day COVID-19 cases in EU/EAA countries and the United Kingdom are generally the same as in Hubei Province (China) (figure 1).
For EU/EA and the United Kingdom as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 has increased since around 21 February 2020, then sharply on 28 February (additional material).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but there is a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of all other EU/EA countries and COVID-19 in the United Kingdom (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020, compared to Italy.
As of March 15th, at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom had reported the same total number of cases as Italy in less than three weeks.
Our results show that the number of cases reported by EU/EA and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for COVID-19 is increasing rapidly.
The observed COVID-19 cumulative morbidity trends indicate that the epidemic is developing at similar rates in all countries.
Despite the fact that countries are at different stages of national public health responses, the definition of cases may vary from country to country, and the options used to select patients who must undergo COVID-19 diagnostic tests — including additional tests — vary, but the situation is the same.
In early March 2020, according to doctors in the affected areas of Italy, about 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, while media reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care wards in these areas had reached maximum load levels.
At the EU/EA level, only 6% and 1% of COVID-19 cases are currently available for hospitalization and/or admission to intensive care wards, respectively (data not shown).
However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner in order to supplement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths ...
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of places available for intensive care and medium-term care in European countries varied widely, ranging from 29.2 per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more resources than or less than Italy (per 100,000 people in 2010 - 2011 with 12.5 intensive care and medium-term care).
ECDC modeled the health-care capacity saturation and associated scenarios for the sixth update of COVID-19 rapid risk assessment and estimated the relationship between the prevalence of COVID-19 patients in each EU/EA country and in the United Kingdom, and the risk of exceeding the number of intensive care beds & gt; 90%.
Since cases have so far been concentrated in EU/EEA countries and in certain areas of UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population covered by the identified areas, it is advisable to provide information on cases and places of intensive care at the level of Standard Statistical Geographical Module 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the EU/EA and the UK ' s COVID-19 pandemic are developing rapidly.
Therefore, both the State, hospitals and ICUs should be prepared to respond to the continuing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care, as in the affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a fast, positive and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 and requires a transition from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases, if not implemented earlier, may leave policymakers and hospitals with insufficient time to understand, accept and adjust response measures.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity through which countries can further increase controls to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care systems.
Otherwise, other EU/EA countries are likely to face a surge in the number of patients in need of intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The outbreak of 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS coronary virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths and massive human catastrophes.
Similar to the congener SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of infections in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Although COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, it is more diffuse and affects more older people than young people, and more men than women.
In view of the rapid increase in publications related to new coronary pneumonia, this paper is intended to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving research topic.
We will present basic knowledge about the epidemiology of the disease, its causes, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this synthesis will contribute to understanding and eradicating this terrible disease.
Spring on January 25th, 2020, became an unprecedented and engraved memory of the Chinese, and the outbreak of a new type of viral disease forced everyone to stay out of their homes throughout the holidays and weeks thereafter.
The virus is highly homogenic with the coronary virus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of SARS in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, with the associated disease known as coronary virus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country, then to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had led to over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which more than 40,000 had been discharged and more than 3,000 had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 has become the "public enemy number one" and that it may be more threatening than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months since the first report on the separation of virus sequences from multiple patients, dated 7 January 2020, on viral science, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment.
The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the progress of research in this emerging field of study.
It is customary to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CV-induced disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss the knowledge gained so far on the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some pressing issues that remain to be addressed.
The CV has always been considered a non-lethal pathogens in humans, causing about 15% of the common cold.
But this century has already seen two highly pathogenic humans, the SARS-CoV and the MERS-COV, which erupted in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and spread rapidly to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality rates.
So this COVID-19 outbreak is the third COV outbreak recorded in human history.
As figure 1,1 shows, Wuhan City first reported several cases of pneumonia for unknown reasons to the Chinese National Health Board on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
On January 15th, 2020, Wuhan reported the first case of death.
At the same time, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20th, medical personnel were reported to be infected, suggesting that there might be a human being.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed down and all public transport was closed.
On January 24, the first clinical study on new coronary pneumonia showed that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan South China Seafood market, which was considered to be the starting point for infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30th, WHO declared the outbreak a "global health emergency".
By the time this report was issued, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (figure 2 (Fig.2).
Due to the rapid development of the epidemic, the ultimate extent and severity of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study for 8,866 patients (including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients) provided an update of the epidemic, as shown below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 can affect all age groups, but the main age group is 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons are over 50 years of age, a very small minority under 20, and only 14 infected persons are under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more men (0.31 per 100,000) than women (0.27 per 100,000).
COVID-19 concentrated in and around the north of the lake.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9 days) days from onset to diagnosis.
Average latency period is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time between onset and death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic reproduction number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially by January 23, 2020, corresponding to the time of mass movement before the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases is 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and 3.06 per cent for all patients (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (60 years) and severe pneumonia.
The CV is a large family of membrane viruses with a single chain of justice.
They can be divided into four categories, alpha, beta, gamma and thorium, in which alpha-CoV and beta-CoV are known to be infected with humans.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV glucose proteins (S) combined with their cell receptor angiogenesis transfer enzyme 2 (ACE2) and diazine enzyme 4 (DPP4) and then membrane integration.
The virus RNA genome was released into the cell mass; after its reproduction, the genome RNA, together with membrane sugar protein and kernel protein, formed a cyst containing the virus, then merged with the membrane and released the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10th, 2020.
As a result, SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV, with genetic consistency exceeding 99.98 per cent of the 10 sequenced samples collected from the South China Seafood market in Wuhan, the site of the initial outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is more geneticly similar to SARS-CoV.
SAS-CoV-2 particles have been found in super thin slices of the skin on the human gas channel through a trans-electronic microscope.
The study found that ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the combination of S proteins and human ACE2 is weak relative to SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to become less infected than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce new short proteins coded by orf3b and urogenated proteins coded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit the expression of IFN beta; however, the orf8 does not contain any known functional structure domain or base sequence.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported on the refrigerated electron microscope (cryo-EM) structure of the all-people ACE2 compound formed with amino acid trans-shipment protein B0AT1 with resolution of 2.9 Á.
They found that the compound had an open and closed image, was assembled into a dichotomy, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could combine two S proteins, thus providing evidence of CV identification and infection.
B0AT1 could be a drug screening target for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Origin and intermediate host
It is well known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV all originated in bats and spread to humans through beavers and camels, respectively.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 to other CV systems, bats are considered natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is consistent with two SARS samples from bats, called Bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Bat-SL-CoVZX21, respectively.
However, it is not clear which host will help the virus to infect humans across the species barrier, and the route of transmission will need to be clarified.
Ji and others suggested that snakes were carriers from bats to humans, which involved a congener reorganization within S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, believe that a CV found in mountain armour, a long-kissed ant animal often used for Chinese medicine, has 99% gene homogenicity with SARS-CoV-2, and therefore considers that the mountain armour is a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, concrete evidence is yet to provide decisive results (Fig.33).
The scientific nature of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive physically for 48 hours in a dry environment and for up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may be of a similar nature.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be effective against living viruses for ultraviolet light and heat sensitivity - 56 °C 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinators, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents, but chlorine is determined not to be effective against living viruses.
Humans generally lack immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies available on the SARS-CoV-2 immunization response.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).
In general, after the invasion of the host, the virus is first identified by the host's built-in immune system through mode recognition of the receptor (PRR), including C-type condensate sample receptor (TLR), Toll sample receptor (NLR), NOD sample receptor (NLR) and RIG-I sample receptor (RLR).
The virus is expressed through a variety of road-routing inflammation factors, tree twilight cell maturity and I-type interferobic synthesis, which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the oscillation of the antigen cells of the virus.
But, SARS-CoV's N protein can help free the virus from immune response.
Adaptive immuno-responses will soon join the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+T cells, play an important role in antiviral defence.
CD4+T cell irritation B cells produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+T cells directly kill infected cells.
Auxiliary T-cells produce inflammation cytogens to help the defense cells.
But CoV can suppress T-cell function by inducing the death of T-cells.
Vaginal immunisation, including patches — such as C3a and C5a — and antibodies, is also critical to the resistance to viral infections.
For example, the antibodies separated from the recovered patients can be reconciled with MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the immune system's over-reaction can produce large amounts of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organ failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a concentrated disease, is more likely to affect older people with multiple combinations, as well as pregnant women.
Often, individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or impaired immune functions are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on a study of the earliest 425 cases in Wuhan City, the average potential duration of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated at 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average incubation period of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study shows that the latency period is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust the effective isolation time to the most accurate incubation period, so as to prevent the transmission of the virus to others by those infected without symptoms.
As a rule, a person exposed to or infected with the virus usually needs to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the isolation be extended to 24 days?
Heating is usually the main and initial symptoms of COVID-19, which can be free of any other symptoms, or can be accompanied by symptoms such as dry cough, agitation, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, ingesting, aldicarb, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients have respiratory difficulties and/or low oxygen haemorrhage a week after the onset of the disease.
If you're serious, you're going to be in acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis shock, metabolic acid poisoning and coagulation functional disorders.
Even in the absence of lung imaging anomalies, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should undergo viral screening for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% fever, 76% cough, respiratory difficulties 55% and diarrhoea 3%; 8% of patients needed air support.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies on the incidence of family-based congregnation disorders and the spread of non-symptomatic individual infections.
By contrast, a demographic study carried out in 2012 showed that the main symptoms were the fever (98 per cent), the cough (47 per cent) and the respiratory difficulties (55 per cent).
However, 80% of these patients need air support, far more than COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with the higher death rate of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and osteoporosis (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, fever (99% - 100%), cough (29% - 75%), breathing difficulties (40% - 42%), diarrhoea (20 - 25%) and osteoporosis (13 - 25%) have been shown to be the main symptoms, and about 14% - 20% of patients need air support.
As of February 14, COVID-19 cases had reached 66,576, with a mortality rate of 2 per cent.
By comparison, as of November 2002, SARS had a mortality rate of 10% in 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate for 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.
An early study reported R0 of SARS-CoV-2 as high as 6.47, 95% of the confidence interval (CI) as 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 as low as 2-4.
Table 1.1 shows the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.
The above data show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher proliferation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, controlling SARS-CoV-2 epidemics is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Concentrating diseases usually occur in the same household, or from the same gathering or means of transport, such as cruise ships.
The patient usually has a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other epidemic areas, or of close contact with the infected person or patient, within the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, it was reported that people could carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and that the cured patients who had been discharged from hospital could carry the virus again, thereby alerting them to prolonged isolation.
Patients are normal or decreasing in the number of blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the outer weeks of the early onset of the disease.
For example, white cell count & lt; 4x109/L - including lymphocyte count & lt; 1x109/L - reduction of lymphocyte cells, increased levels of twilight aminocyte transfer enzymes and viral haemoemia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients see elevated levels of hepatic and myases and myoglobins in the blood, most of them see increased levels of blood C reaction protein and blood sank.
Heavy patients can see blood fibre protein degradation products D-diplexing and a decrease in lymphocyte cell count.
Most of the COVID-19 patients can see an anomaly in chest imaging, characterized by double-sided specking or lung grinding glass.
Patients usually experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and fibrosis can seriously damage the gas exchange.
Pneumocular functional impairments of the I and II pulmonary bubbles reduce the level of surfactants and increase surface tension, thereby reducing lung expansion and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
So, the worst chest-image discovery usually comes at the same time as the worst of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, COVID-19 ' s first pathological analysis found pneumocular cell loss in a patient who died of the disease ' s lung, transparent membrane formation, mesoly lymphocyte cell impregnation and polynucleocellular cells, consistent with viral infections and ARDS pathological performance, and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, because of the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, China began to use clinical performance for diagnosis (rather than relying solely on RT-PCR) on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred during the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, combined with medical history, clinical performance, laboratory tests and visual results are essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Zhang Feng team reported a program using the CRISPR-based SHERLONK technical test SARS-CoV-2, which does not require sophisticated instruments and uses a test paper to detect a synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA segment in less than an hour at concentrations of 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter).
If tested in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of diagnosis.
Due to lack of experience in treating new CVs, doctors mainly support treatments for COVID-19 patients, while attempting various treatments that have been used or proposed for other CVs, such as SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs, and other viral diseases (table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments such as antivirals, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma for recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even suggested that the blood plasma of the recovered patient should be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 may begin with a major attack on the lung or may express other ACE2 organs such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys at a lower level.
Nevertheless, respiratory disorders and failure are the main threats to patients and the main cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore essential to abating symptoms and saving lives, including routine oxygen use, high-flow oxygen use, non-absorption and mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be supported by an ECMO, an improved CPR bypass technology for life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating regenerative infections and sepsis, and protecting critical organ functions are essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is well known that the over-reaction of SARS and MERS' immune systems can lead to cyto-factor storms.
Cell-factor storms are a form of overall inflammation response characterized by a series of cell-factors releases, including TNF-α, IL-1-beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-α, IFN-beta, INN-gamma and MCP-1.
These factors induce the immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cyto-factor storms, especially among people with severe illnesses.
Cortical steroids and beads are resistant -- an IL6 monoclon antibodies -- and have been used to treat cytogen storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytogenstorms include: regulating T-cell-directed immunisation responses; blocking IFN-gamma, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK; Bonna's vomiting resistance; cytological signal transfer inhibitor4; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants to treat SARS to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
But large doses of steroids are not good for severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially ischaemic bone failure, which can seriously affect the prognosis.
Despite this, short-range treatment is recommended for patients suffering from critical condition COVID-19 with a low and medium dose of cortical steroids.
At the time of writing, the existence of effective ART had not yet been confirmed.
However, it has been found that Radhcive, a nuclear acid analogue, is effective for a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Redhivie was a new antiviral drug developed by Gilid, initially for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola virus and the Marburg virus.
Later on, it proved that Redcive could suppress other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gilid has provided the drug to China for two clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons, the results of which are expected.
In addition, potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms have been proposed for Barricktini, alpha-interfergen, Lopinavi/Litonave and Libaverin.
The combined treatment of Lopinave/Litonave may result in diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects.
The interaction between these treatments and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibody generation for recovered patients
The collection of blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease or for the protection of healthy individuals from the disease has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients usually have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood for pathogens.
The antibodies are an immunoglobin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes for use against pathogens and other foreign organisms that identify unique molecules in pathogens and directly connect them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and injected to 10 people at risk.
Their symptoms have improved in 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads and increased haematological saturation.
However, before special treatments can be developed, there is a need for validation and clarification to suggest methods that can be used on a large scale.
In addition, given the effects of the treatment, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate immune reactions and cause cytogen emission syndromes, a toxic reaction that can endanger life.
Antibody concentrations in blood are usually low, and there is a high demand for plasma for the treatment of people at risk.
It's hard to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, the more critical and practical approach is to separate B cells from the recovered patient and identify the genetic code that encodes the effective antibody or screens the effective antibody for the protein necessary for the virus.
In this way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
In China, the use of TCM to treat multiple diseases has been in the history of thousands of years.
However, the efficacy of the treatment depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple components of the prescription, which differs according to the diagnosis of the disease according to the TCM theory.
Most active ingredients are still unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and validate them or their optimal combination ...
At present, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternatives for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from the severe stage of their illness.
For example, it has been found that the venom capsules and the scavenger capsules are effective for the COVID-19 treatment.
In several provinces of China, 87 per cent of patients use TCM treatment, with the highest rates observed for COVID-19 patients, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ningxia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while Hubei province uses only about 30 per cent of COVID-19 patients, with the lowest rates (13 per cent).
However, this is only a rough comparison, as many other influencing factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should also be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Zhang and his colleagues published a study on Western Medicine (WM) for treatment alone in conjunction with WW and TCM.
They found that the temperature recovery of the WM+TCM group, the absence of symptoms and the time spent in hospital were significantly shorter than the simple WM group.
Most impressively, the symptoms of symptoms in the WM+TCM group (from light to heavy) are significantly lower than in the pure WM group (7.4 per cent versus 46.2 per cent) and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group is similarly lower than in the simple WM group (8.8 per cent versus 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM still require a higher quality control test, greater scope and more centres to verify it.
The role mechanisms of TCM treatment or its combinations and, where possible, the description of their effective components will also be of interest.
Most of the patients suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 are extremely afraid of this highly contagious and even lethal disease, and the isolated suffer from distress, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as heat, oxygen deficiency and cough, and adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by cortex steroids, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychological responses were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychiatric symptoms, pretences and even suicide.
As part of the public health response to the outbreak of COVID-19, mandatory close contact tracing and isolation can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, isolation and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, people in close contact and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication through regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic equipment and applications to avoid close contact.
An effective vaccine is essential to disrupt the transmission chain from animal host and infected patient to sensory host and is often used as a complementary means of antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Industry has made efforts to develop a S-protein-based vaccine to produce long-term and effective intermediate antibodies and/or protective immunization against SARS-CoV.
The detoxification vaccine has been evaluated in the SARS animal model.
However, prior to the initiation of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in older persons and lethal attack models and their protective effect on co-infection with the virus has not yet been determined.
It's probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
By contrast, the persistence of common human and animal diseases in the affected areas has led to the persistence of sporadic cases and concentrated diseases in the Middle East region and their spread to other regions.
Through the use of active viruses, DNA, mass particles, viral carriers, nanoparticles, viral sample particles and recombinant proteins, vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine for non-immunized individuals against SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current epidemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time required for vaccine development (average of 18 months) and the dynamics of the CV.
As a new kind of disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show the full clinical process among thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover gradually, without any after-effects.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has high morbidity and mortality rates.
Therefore, the establishment of a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health-care institutions to set priorities for services, especially in areas with limited resources ...
According to clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect the prognosis or prognosis of COVID-19 patients (table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor influencing SARS projections, as is COVID-19.
As mentioned earlier, in a study that included 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7 per cent were over 50.
Patients in need of intensive care are more likely to have basic syndrome and complications and are significantly older than patients in need of intensive care (the median age is 66 to 51 years), suggesting age as a preposterative factor in the fate of the COVID-19 patient.
Sex: As mentioned above, more males than females are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31 per 100,000 vs. 0.27 per 100,000).
Mergers and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and heart disorders.
Heart event is also the leading cause of death of SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be combined with ACE2 positive chord cells, which could lead to an abnormal liver function for COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age is closely related to underlying diseases and may interact with each other.
Laboratory results are abnormal: C reaction protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and are considered to be disease, therapeutic response and potential pre-posterative factors for eventual recovery.
The relevance of the CRP level to the magnitude of COVID-19 and its prognosis was also raised.
In addition, the elevated LDH, AST, ALT and CK may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So they're traditional signs of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: the temporal progress of chest imaging and clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues to predict COVID-19 endings and complications.
Steroid use: As previously mentioned, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as complementary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
As large doses of cortical steroids are widely used in heavy SARS patients, many survivors suffer from ischaemic bone failure, leading to permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at small doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As mentioned earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients were under great stress because they were often subjected to prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the deaths of relatives and patients.
Psychological counselling and long-term support are needed to help these patients escape stress and resume their lives.
According to demographic studies to date, the epidemiology of COVID-19 seems to differ from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at an early stage of the infection, similar to other CVs that cause common colds.
As a result, during the early or incubation period, the infected generate a large number of viruses in the course of their daily activities, which makes it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is considered to occur when the patient's condition is severe, and most transmission does not occur at an early stage.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than SARS.
China is currently making tremendous efforts, including the blockade of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued isolation of almost all the population, with a view to disrupting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have caused serious damage to China ' s economy and others, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the epidemic is slowing down.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and that the decline will last 3-4 months.
Other experts, however, are less optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have developed models for predicting the consequences of the epidemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be infected by two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that patients recovering and discharged two weeks ago detected SARS-CoV-2, both in their nosenails and in swabs, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to influenza.
However, with the reduction in the number of new cases, there are encouraging signs in China that the current strategy may have worked.
The Ebola virus was predicted to cause 1 million cases and 500,000 deaths.
But through strict isolation, the disease is finally under control.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become less contagious, eventually disappearing or becoming a less pathogenic virus co-existing with the human body.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with SARS and MERS (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted by coughing or sneezing, or even by direct contact with a virus-contaminated object.
The virus has also been found in the faeces, increasing the likelihood that the faeces will spread.
A recent study, which included 138 cases, showed that 41 per cent of the cases could have been caused by in-house infections, including 17 patients who had previously suffered from other diseases and 40 health-care personnel.
Therefore, more intensive preventive measures should be taken to protect the population, particularly medical personnel, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have had contact with the patient or the infected.
The first line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 dust masks (series 1860s) can help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent liquid droplets from potential infected persons from spreading in the air or adhesive to the surface of objects that may pass on to others.
However, only N95 (series 1860s) masks can prevent inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, only 5% can fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and is about 85 nm.
Since viral particles can penetrate even five stacked surgical masks, medical personnel who come into direct contact with the patient must wear a N95 (series 1860s) mask, not a surgical mask.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should wear isolation suits in order to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On January 22nd, 2020, a doctor, wearing a N95 mask, contracted SARS-CoV-2; the virus may have entered her body through inflammation eyes.
Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent masks or goggles when dealing with patients.
For the public in areas affected by the epidemic or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that all people wash their hands more frequently than usual with disinfection soap, remain indoor self-segregated as much as possible, and limit access to potential infected persons.
Three feet is thought to be the right distance for people to stay away from their patients.
These measures are an effective way of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, based on a deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003, its high homogeneity with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, was supposed to be of high alert to China.
However, until January 19, 2020, the Director of the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control in Wuhan City was still appeased, stating that the new virus was not contagious, that the potential for human transmission was limited and that the epidemic was preventable.
The news clearly eased public vigilance and was missed at the beginning of the Spring Festival to contain the outbreak at Wuhan's critical node.
China's disease control agencies may learn this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious in issuing bulletins, as every word is vital to citizens and can change their attitudes and decision-making; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information coming from hospitals rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) contain potential outbreaks more rigorously at an early stage than try to appease the public; and (4) conduct more frequent, targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic and regularly test and improve social response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2, began at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months, it had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak looks like SARS relapse.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
More older people than young people are affected by COVID-19, more men than women, and the severity and mortality of older patients is higher than that of young patients.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Even without symptoms, COVID-19 patients transmit the virus, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus only when the disease is severe, making it much more difficult to control COVID-19 transmission than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads far more rapidly and widely than SARS-CoV.
For some COVID-19 patients, the regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA test may be negative.
On the other hand, a cured patient may return to the sun.
These discoveries significantly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.
Given the rapidness of the study on COVID-19, the following key issues remain to be resolved:
SARS-CoV-2 Where did it come from?
Although 96% of the gene homogenicity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats, we were unable to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
What kind of animal is it that spreads the virus from the original host, hypothetically the bat, to the middle host of humans?
If we don't know the answers to questions 1 and 2, we won't be able to effectively cut off the transmission routes and the outbreak can recur at any time.
Even though molecular models and biochemical analyses have proven that SARS-CoV-2 is combined with ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and induce subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus combine the cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
If there's no clear answer to these questions, we can't achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve during human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic? Will it disappear like SARS, or will it re-emerge as regularly as the flu?
Finding answers to the above and many other questions is crucial, but may take a longer time.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to put an end to the epidemic and bring our lives back to normal as soon as possible.
Human and animal origin of the coronary virus.
For thousands of years, mutagenicity and adaptability have driven the coronaviruses, CoVs and their hostess, including humans.
Before 2003, it was known that there were two types of human coronary virus (HCoV) that could cause mild diseases, such as common colds.
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome reversed the situation, revealing the destructive and lethal nature of HCOV infection.
The SARS-CoV-2 that appeared in central China at the end of 2019 once again brought COV to the fore, surprisingly, it is more contagious than its sister SARS-CoV, but less pathogenic.
The HCoV infection is a human and animal disease, so it'll help us to understand the origin of the HCoV.
Most HCOVs originate from bats and are non-pathogenic.
Some of the intermediate storage hosts of HCoV are also known.
The identification of animal hostess is directly relevant to the prevention of human disease.
Researching the interaction of CV hosts in animals may also give us a deeper insight into the human mechanism of CV.
In this overview, we present an overview of the knowledge available in seven HCoVs, highlighting their discovery history, the origin of human and animal diseases and the spread of inter-species.
What's important is that we compare and contrast different HCOVs from the point of view of the evolution of the virus and the re-enactment of the genome.
Against this background, we're looking at the current outbreak of the 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, the paper focuses on the requirements for successful host conversion and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease.
The CV is a coronary virus unit, made up of a single chain of justice with a membrane RNA virus.
These viruses have the largest genome of the RNA virus, containing 2.6 to 32,000 alkalis, and are known as "CoV" because of the coronary form under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoV has a non-sub-genomic group sharing similar organizations.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab copy enzyme polyprotein.
These polyproteins were further processed to produce 16 non-structured proteins called nsp1-16.
The rest of the genome consists of structural proteins (ORFs), including punctures (S), membranes (E), membranes (M) and nuclear proteins (N).
Many spectrospecific auxiliary proteins are also coded by CVs from different spectras.
CoV is divided into four categories (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and thorium-CoV) depending on the protein sequence difference, of which beta-CoV consists of most HCOVs and is broken down into four spectras (A, B, C and D).
Systematic developmental evidence shows that bats and rodents are the genetic sources of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main hosts of gamma-CoV and thorium-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has crossed the species barrier, some of which have become important human pathogens.
So far, seven types of infected human coronary virus (HCoV) have been known.
Of which HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
5 other beta-CoVs including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronary Virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronary Virus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually give rise to mild symptoms such as common flu and/or diarrhoea.
By contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV-2 and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, cause severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively larger number of patients and are more likely to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute Respiratory Distrusion Syndrome, ARDS) and external lung performance.
In the mid-1960s, the first HCoV-229E virus strain B814 was separated from the nasal secretions of common cold patients.
Since then, humans have accumulated more knowledge through extensive research on both HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses that can cause self-restrictive symptoms.
In fact, prior to the SARS outbreak, the concept of infection with HCoV was widely accepted.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating events in history, with more than 8,000 people infected and a crude death rate of about 10 per cent.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to other parts of the world.
2019 The new HCov virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen of the ongoing 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), which, as of March 3, 2020, has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm has been sounded, and the world must be ready for the forthcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven types of HCoV have their origin in humans and animals from bats, rats or domestic animals.
There's a variety of evidence that all HCov evolution has its origins in bats, where viruses are highly adaptable and non-pathogenic, but exhibit a great deal of genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 outbreak has brought enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origin of HCOV ' s human and animal co-infections provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and constraints of viral species leaping.
In addition, this will guide or facilitate the identification of future storage hosts for SARS-CoV-2, intermediate hosts and extended animal hosts, which will be important in preventing future virus spills.
In this overview, we give an overview of the origins of HCoV ' s human and animal diseases, inter-species transmission and morbidity mechanisms.
In particular, we have highlighted and explored a common theme, namely, that HCov's progeny virus is not usually pathogenic in its natural storage host, but is pathogenic after trans-species have spread to the new host.
In addition, we have reviewed the trend towards the evolution of the HCoV, in which the increase in transmission is often accompanied by a reduction in pathogenicity.
Against this background, we also discussed the outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Since the late 1930s, the CV has been widely known.
Before the first separation of HCOV-229E bacterial strains from common flu patients, B814, medical scientists had separated the COV from various infected animals (including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs).
In the last few decades, seven types of HCOV have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of the HCoV discovery in chronological order (table 1) will provide us with a wealth of information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCOV-229E strain was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infections and subsequently adapted to growth in the WI-38 lung cell strain.
People infected with HCov-229E have headaches, sneezes, discomfort, larynx symptoms, fever, cough, etc. 10-20%.
In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the growth of the brain of the mouse and its subsequent successive generations.
The clinical characteristics of the HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E and do not differ significantly in the symptoms from those of other respiratory pathogens (e.g. influenza A virus and nasal virus).
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, mainly in temperate climates.
Usually, the two viruses have less than a week's incubation, followed by about two weeks.
A study of human volunteers has shown that healthy individuals infected with HCOV-229E have a mild common cold.
Only a few patients with low immune capacity showed severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "Atypical Pneumonia", was the first fully documented HCOV-induced pandemic in human history, with the pathogen SARS-CoV, the third found HCOV.
The first SARS case dates back to Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002.
SARS caused 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, which spread to many countries and continents.
It is estimated that each case, in addition to the super-transmissor, could lead to approximately 2 cases of re-emergence of between 4 and 7 days and a peak in viral load of 10 days.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV were initially suffering from myotheic pains, headaches, fever, discomfort and cold warfare, followed by late-stage symptoms such as respiratory difficulties, coughing and respiratory distress.
Decline in lymphocytes, hepatic function abnormalities and rises in myorate hormones are unusual laboratory tests that are common in SARS.
In addition, widespread pneumoconiosis damage was observed in SARS patients, increased growth of upper skin cells and megacormic cells.
Then about 20-30% of the patients needed intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, the liver and the kidney, are also likely to be infected and usually accompanied by a cytogenoid storm, which may be fatal in patients with low immune functions.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy conducted by a relative of the original patient who travelled to Hong Kong in Guangzhou.
Since then, people have been working on HCOV research.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially found to be endemic in young children, the elderly and immunosuppressed with respiratory diseases.
Among the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, nose inflammation, conjunctivitis, fever and fine bronchitis are common.
Another independent study shows that the same virus was isolated from the nasal cavity samples of an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was discovered in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to obstructive larynitis (also known as Grub larynitis).
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old male who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to community access to pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported for acute asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide to cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four communities have acquired HCOVs that are well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to undergo mutation leading to highly pathogenic diseases, but there are also accidents, for unknown reasons, such as a more toxic rare subtype of HCOV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to communicate and survive effectively in humans, their toxicity or pathogenicity is reduced.
MERS-CoV was first separated from the lungs of a 60-year-old acute pneumonia and kidney failure patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases came from the Middle East, imported cases were reported in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary transmission to persons in close contact.
In 2015, there was a re-emergence of re-emergence in Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical performance of MERS is similar to SARS, characterized by gradual acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also suffer from acute kidney failure, which is unique to the disease so far caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported, with a high rate of death of 34.4 per cent, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
In mid-December, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in mid-December 2019, concentrated pneumonia was detected and retrospect analysis confirmed to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has declared the continuing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be a public health emergency of international concern and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases had been diagnosed globally, with a crude death rate of 3.4 per cent.
It is worth noting that the rate of death in Hubei, China, is 4.2 per cent, compared to 1.2 per cent in areas outside Hubei.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory infections in the form of fever, cough and breathing difficulties.
Some of the patients also suffer from diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms, rapidly developing into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% of the high nucleotide sequence homogeneity, they are clustered into different branches in system growth trees.
SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more contagious.
The reported emergence of SARS-CoV-2 non-symptomatic infections may accelerate the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with 6 other HCOVs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First of all, the incubation and duration of the HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the general trend of the other 6 HCOVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms ranges from SARS-CoV to 4 communities with access to HCOV (i.e. HCOV-229/E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are more common in community access to HCOV infections, including non-specific, mild or non-symptomatic manifestations.
On the other hand, a small number of serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV cases, albeit at a slightly lower rate.
Thirdly, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of community access to HCOV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as communicable as community access HCOV.
On the other hand, whether SARS-CoV-2's communicability, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, declines after human generations, remains to be verified.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in excreta samples.
At least in some cases, it remains to be clarified whether SARS-CoV-2 manure-port transmission plays an important role as it does in SARS-CoV.
In addition, it is important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community access to HCOV.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenicity and continuous transmission from generation to generation will have an important impact on the fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All four communities with mild symptoms have acquired HCOVs that are well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, humans have adapted well to these four types of HCOV.
In other words, both of them could be survivors of the ancient HCOV pandemic.
HCOV and those who suffer from severe HCOV disease have died.
To that end, HCoV must be replicated in humans enough to accumulate adaptive mutations against host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the more people are infected, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it's well adapted, its spread in humans will be difficult to stop through quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, these four communities have acquired a sexual coronary virus that spreads among the population, leading to a common cold among people with a normal immune function.
These viruses don't need animal hostess.
By contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not yet well adapted to humans, nor can they continue to spread in humans.
They need to survive and reproduce among the host of common human and animal diseases, and may seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets through one or more intermediate hosts and expand host populations.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 community access HCOV.
It's as contagious as community access HCoV, at least for now.
However, it is more pathogenic than community access to sexual HCOV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it is fully adapted to humans and recycles within humans without a host or intermediate animal host remains to be seen.
Before discussing the origin of the HCoV animal, there is some guidance for us to discuss the evolution of the HCoV host, the natural host, the storage host, the intermediate host and the definition and characteristics of the extended host.
If an animal has a close ancestor at the nucleotide sequence level, the animal will become an evolutionary host for HCoV.
The ancestor virus is usually adaptable and non-pathetic in this host.
Likewise, storage hosts will carry HCoV.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and a natural host of HCoV or its progeny.
By contrast, if HCoV had just been born in the middle host soon after or shortly after, it would not have been well adapted to the new host and would normally be pathological.
This intermediate host can act as a source of common human and animal infection and act as an amplification of the host by allowing the virus to be replicated briefly and then transmitted to humans to increase the scale of human infection.
If HCoV can't sustain its spread within the host, terminal infections can occur.
Instead, HCoV can adapt to the host, even creating a long-term locality.
In this case, the host becomes the host of natural storage.
The retrospective analysis of epidemiological data found that SARS indexed cases had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence surveys show higher levels of immunoglobin G (IgG) anti-SARS-CoV in animal vendors than in the general population.
In the live animal market, the beaver and a beaver cat were found for the first time carrying almost exactly the same SARS-CoV virus as the SARS-CoV virus.
The fact that there was no further SARS report after removing all the fruit beavers from the market indirectly supports this view.
However, according to the report, the testing of SARS-CoV by farm fruit beavers in wild or unexposed animal markets is largely negative, suggesting that the beavers may be only intermediately magnifying the host, not the natural host of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that, since 80% of the Guangzhou market has SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that many small mammals may also serve as hosts between SARS-CoV.
All these animals seem to be terminal hosts for SARS-CoV.
A subsequent study of SARS-CoV natural animal host found a closely related bat coronary virus, known as HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) associated with SARS, which survived in the chrysanthemum of China.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bat coronary viruses have 88-92% nucleotide homogeneity with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept of bats as hosts to emerging human pathogens.
In addition, researchers have identified various SARS sample coronary viruses (SL-CoV) from bats, but no virus can be isolated as a living virus except for one designated WIV1.
Human vascular stressor transformation enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of known SARS-CoV.
Experiments have shown that the WIV1 from the bat dung sample uses bats, fruit beavers and human ACE2 as receptors to the cell.
Interestingly, the serotons of SARS recovering patients can be reconciled with WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestor to bat SARS-CoV, with 95% of the nucleotide sequence homogenicity.
Although the two viruses are highly homogenous, it is generally assumed that WIV1 is not a direct parent of SARS-CoV, nor is the bat a direct repository of SARS-CoV.
Systems development analysis groupes MERS-CoV with bats CoV-HKU4 and bats CV-HKU5.
Bats CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, diazine enzyme4 (DPP4) to intrude into the virus.
RNA for MERS-CoV dependency RNA polymer enzyme sequences are closer to RNA in system development than in bats beta-CoV from Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its next-of-kin bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homogeneity.
As a result, bats may not be the direct repository of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that single-camel sero-positive for the MERS-CoV specific and antibodies are the same as those originating in several African countries in the Middle East.
The separation of the activity from the nose swab of a single camel, MERS-CoV, is the same as the virus found in the human body, which further suggests that the camel is the true storage host of MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that in camels with experimental infection MERS-CoV, the symptoms are generally minor, but a large number of viruses are observed to fall off.
It is worth noting that infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the faeces, which are also the main way for bats to spread the virus.
Problems remain, however, because many of the identified cases do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which may be attributed to humans or unknown means of transmission, including unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 and the bat COV RATTG13 separated from the central daisy have 96.2% nucleotide homogenicity.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATTG13 is too wide to determine intergenerational relationships.
In other words, bats may not be the direct repository of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are discovered in the near future.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should be associated with many of the original COVID-19 cases of wildlife species sold and slaughtered at the South China Sea Wholesale Market, indicating possible animal-to-human transmission incidents.
Several recent studies based on macrogenomic sequences suggest that a endangered small mammal known as mountain armour can also carry ancestral beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new mountain-capture virus genomes have 85-92% nucleotide homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2.
But they're also as close to RAG13, about 90% homogenic at the nucleotide sequence level.
In the system development tree, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 prototype subsystems, one of which has a more similar receptor complex (RBD) with 97.4% amino acid sequence homogenicity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATTG13 are even more different, although the sequences of the entire genome are more homogenous.
An earlier study on sick pedicure also reported the detection of overlapping strains from lung samples, and the results were similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study, using different assembly methods and manual processing, obtained partial genome sequences of about 86.3% of the entire genome of the virus.
We can't rule out the possibility that mountain armor is one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal hostess.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from mountain armour due to differences in the beta-CoV sequence associated with mountain armour SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATTG13 is even shorter than the distance between beta-CoV, which is associated with passing through the mountain armour SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, through the mammal and other mammals is still to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homogenicity was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and mountain armour, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RATTG13 have the highest entire genome sequence homogenicity.
It is highly assumed that the high similarity between the beta-CoV and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 through the Mountain Armour SARS-CoV-2 is due to the evolution of the convergence of selective guides.
Another contrary view is that the related beta-CoV and RATG13 are reorganised in the third species of wild animals through the mountain armour SARS-CoV-2.
As a driving force of evolution, reorganization is widespread in beta-CoV.
The origin of the direct human and animal disease of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet conclusive.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOV, researchers have studied the origins of HCOV-229/E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1.
Systematic developmental evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from a bat coronary virus, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been found in rodents.
According to the report, the ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge Co.V) coronary virus found in three-coloured bats in North America shows a close connection to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has a genetic link to another bat coronary virus (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008) found in Ghana, in which camels are suspected of being host.
For the sake of clarity, figure 1 and table 2 summarize existing knowledge of the origins of known HCOV animals.
Systems development analysis provides evidence of historical inter-cropping events in HCOV.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from livestock to species, there was an epidemic of respiratory infections.
The history of the inter-species transmission of HCOV-229E is unclear.
The bat alpha-CoV, which is closely related to HCov-229E, has been discovered.
There's a kind of alpaca between the two.
There's a lot of evidence to support the virus's direct transmission from bats to humans.
First of all, humans, rather than camels, may come into contact with bats in a common ecological position.
On the contrary, humans are in close contact with the camels.
Second, the bats associated with HCov-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpaca alpha-CoV causes respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, no camels were found in wild animals.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the camels have access to the alpha-CoV associated with HCOV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipa and Hendra.
It's not surprising, therefore, that bats are spreading HCOV-229E directly to humans.
Or, even though bat alpha-CoV acts as a gene pool for HCov-229E, camels and single-capture camels may be intermediate hosts for the transmission of the virus to humans, which is exactly the same as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of the spread from bats to single-mounted camels and from single-mounted camels to humans.
The evolution of the bat's MERS-CoV is known in its original identification, and subsequent discoveries reinforce this argument.
Apparently, bats provide a rich collection of viruses for inter-species exchange and inter-species transmission.
Long and dense groups, close social interaction and a strong flying power are all the advantages of bats becoming ideal "virus carriers".
On the other hand, the Mers-CoV has been in the single camel for decades.
It's adapted to these camels, and the camels have been transformed from an intermediate host to a stable natural storage host.
MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintains relatively low mutation rates.
It's an accident for the sporadic spread of humans, and because of the unsustainable spread, humans are still the terminal hosts of MERS-CoV.
Compared to the role of camels in the MERs-CoV diffusion, the role of pedals in SARS-CoV-2 transmission (if any) is different.
In particular, the hijab beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in the hijab.
They may be the terminal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV, similar to the fruit beavers in SARS-CoV.
In future studies, it is necessary to identify or exclude the possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animal to human species.
First of all, bats may be the repository of almost identical SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans may share their ecological position with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, a mountain armor could be one of the hostess of the new invasion of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and eating wild flavors.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
There's a need for antibody investigation of livestock and wildlife.
Thirdly, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 may be restructured and adapted to a third species that has been exposed to both bats and pedals.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of animal host, three major factors in the virus also play an important role in promoting coronary viruses across inter-cropping barriers.
First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA reproduction.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the mutation rate of the coronary virus is estimated to be "medium" to "high" and, depending on the adaptation phase of the coronary virus to the new host, the average replacement rate is about 10-4 times per year.
The coronary virus has a proof-readable nucleotide nucleotide enzyme, and its removal would result in very high variability and decay, or even non-viability.
Interestingly, Remdesivir is known to inhibit the replicability of the coronary virus by inhibiting this nucleotide excised enzyme and RNA dependence.
Red Seaway is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of the coronary virus is about a million times higher than that of its host.
Besides, if the coronary virus is not well adapted to the host, it usually has a high mutation rate.
SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower mutation rate than SARS-CoV, indicating that it is more adaptable to humans.
It can be assumed that it has adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-camel camels.
Theoretically, genetic drift is unlikely to result in the rapid breakdown of vaccines and antivirals for SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger RNA genome of the coronary virus has additional plasticity in genetic mutation and recomposition, thus increasing the potential for inter-species cogeneration, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronary viruses when conditions are right.
A large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions to the end code of the genome 3' provide evidence of this.
Thirdly, the coronary virus uses the unique "replicate selection" mechanism to randomly and frequently switch templates during the RNA replication process.
The coV RNA transcribation takes place frequently in the host of a mixed container.
The entire length and subgenome of the high congener can be re-organised to create a new coronary virus.
Evidence of natural reorganisation of system growth was found in the HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronary viruses such as Bats SL-CoV and Bat CoV-HKU9.
Interaction with the virus-host related to transmission
In addition to the three above-mentioned viral factors, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
Using SARS-CoV reorganization as a typical example, the paper shows evidence of positive choices in inter-species transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of the separation strain of humans and fruit beavers SARS-CoV, researchers believe that SARS-CoV can adapt quickly to different hostess, especially through the mutation of S-Protein RBD.
Usually, the RBD in the coronary virus S protein interacts with a cell receptor and is closely screened by the host's antibody reaction.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in S1 section 318 to 510 amino acids, which are combined with human ACE2 and its co-receptors to allow the virus to enter.
SARS-CoV RBD can identify a variety of animal ACE2 receptors, including bats, fruit beavers, mice and beavers, thus spreading the virus between species.
In fact, in RBD, only six different amino acid residues were observed that separate from humans and beaver viruses, of which four were in the receptor process that interacted with ACE2 receptor.
There are K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of the fruit beaver SARS-CoV, which may increase the relative strength of the condensation of fibrous proteins interacting with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these amino acids may be essential for the virus to adapt to humans.
Notably, SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in Unit S1 is 30%, which means that the combination and strength of S-Protein and Human ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study of frozen mirrors shows that the relative strength of the union is 10 to 20 times greater than that of the human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It would also make sense to determine whether any other co-receptors are needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also integrated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCOV receptors, such as HCOV-229E ' s ammonium enzyme N and HCOV-OC43 ' s 9-O-Acetylic saliva acid.
They may also explain the successful adaptation of the coronary virus to humans after its spread from animal host to species.
In addition to the cell receptor, the results of the spread between the HCoV species are influenced by other host dependency and constraints.
The differences between these host proteins in humans and bats, single-camels and rodents, among others, may constitute an obstacle to inter-species transmission.
HCoV must remove the host's dependence factor and break the host's constraints in order to achieve successful inter-species transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in the important area of viral-host interaction remain to be determined and demonstrated.
An impartial whole genome screening of SARS-CoV-2 host dependency and constraints using the latest CRISP technology could yield results.
The emergence of a new type of HCoV: Back to square one
The diversity of the bat coronary virus provides ample opportunity for the emergence of a new type of HCOV.
In that sense, the bat coronary virus acts as a gene bank for HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic re-engineering are drivers of the evolution of HCoV and are two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein coded gene could completely change the shape of the virus.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, because of the separation of SARS-CoV associated bat viruses, it was found that they could be coded in different ORF8 proteins, and therefore the ORF8 was considered important for human adaptation.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 missing nucleotides were found in the separated strain of SARS-CoV.
This deficiency divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to be adaptive mutation for host conversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have been reorganized with the alpha- and gamma-CoV spectra, where a large number of smaller reorganization areas were found in RNA dependency RNA polymerase.
Reorganization points were also found in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, studies have shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced inter-spectral re-organizations, which occurred in Saudi Arabia on a pore-camel.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reorganisation events have been observed in other HCOVs, where HCOVs and other animal coronal viruses are reorganised in their non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can lead to accidental changes in the genome of the virus, probably as a result of reducing the pressure of choice on the virus, such as the host immune system.
One example of these effects is that, in the prototype HCOV-229E strain, the loss of bi-nucleic acids leads to the total loss of ORF4.
Although complete ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the α-CoV displays individual nucleotide penetration, causing a mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is driven by the pressure of the storage host selection.
When bats are infected with the coronary virus, no symptoms or only minor symptoms are detected, indicating that the coronary virus and the bat fit each other.
From anatomy and physiology, bats seem to be well adapted to coronary viruses.
For example, the defects in the activation of the bat-promoting response have effectively reduced pathological changes caused by the coronary virus.
In addition, the natural lethal cell activity of bats is inhibited by the regulation of inhibiting natural lethal cell receptors NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the main tissue compatible composite I molecules.
Moreover, high-level active oxygen (ROS) produced by high metabolic activity of bats can both inhibit replicating coronary viruses and influence proofreading through nucleotide excretion enzymes, thus providing selective pressure on the strain to become highly pathogenic when entering the new host.
More strains of pathogenic coronary virus can also evolve through reorganization, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics to suit host.
So it's no accident that three new HCOVs have emerged in the last two decades.
The coronary virus does not cause disease or mild symptoms in the storage of hosts such as bats and camels.
They do a lot of replicas, and they don't cause a strong host immune response.
That's why there's no symptoms, and there's serious human infections.
The serious symptoms are mainly due to over-activation of the immune response and cytological storm, so the greater the immune response, the greater the lung damage.
In contrast, the immune response has been decoupled from the replicating of the coronary virus among patients with no symptoms.
The same strategy of de-linking the immune response may have a positive impact in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
Interferon reactions are particularly strong in bats.
So, at least at the early stages of the human SARS-CoV-2 infection, the use of I-type jammer should be beneficial.
In addition, there are deficiencies in the activation of NLRP3 in bats.
Based on this reasoning, the use of the MCC950 inhibition NLRP3 inflammation could be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were created.
Although 95% of the bats with SARS-CoV are found to be nucleotide homogenic, there is also a bat coronary virus with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid homogenic as high as 96%.
Although the fruit beavers and other animals in the market have been found carrying the same virus as SARS-CoV, the direct host of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been identified.
It has been found that the pass-through nails that are clearly the same as SARS-CoV-2-- β-CoV, which suggests that the pass-throughs could be one of the middle hosts, or the pass-throughs of β-CoV could have contributed genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or unintentionally manufactured.
As a result of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the coronary virus has again become the focus of attention.
Research on coronary viruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our awareness of the origins of HCOV ' s human and animal co-infections and the importance of animal hostess in human transmission.
There is ample evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and spread to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates in human contact with fruit beavers on the market, closing the wet market and killing the beaver can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same token, given the discovery of multiple spectras of the hijab beta-CoV, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, it should be removed from the wet cargo market in order to prevent the spread of common diseases among humans and animals.
But whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through mountain armour and other mammals remains to be studied further.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the single-camel for a long time.
These camels are important vehicles and the main source of local meat, milk, leather and fur products.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to follow the example of the China Wildlife Market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by sacrificing all the camels in order to control MERS.
In order to stop the re-emergence of MERS, comprehensive initiatives should be taken to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Because we can't get rid of these viruses, new genes may appear, causing an outbreak.
The coronary virus of all kinds circulates in the wild.
In particular, there is a high diversity of bat coronary viruses with common potential for human and animal disease.
There are many opportunities for evolution and reorganization of the coronary virus in these animals, leading to a future in which new coronary viruses are more easily transmitted and/or deadly in humans.
In some parts of China, the culture of wildlife consumption should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
After the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop better preparedness and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have existed on Earth for a long time.
They stay in their natural host until there's a spill.
Although bats have many characteristics conducive to viral transmission, human exposure to bats and other wildlife species is greatly reduced if people are educated away from bats and other wildlife species.
In order to gain a better understanding of the ecological conditions of the coronary virus and its natural host, continuous monitoring of mammals will be necessary and will prove very useful in preventing the spread of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In short, the most effective way to prevent the co-infection of viral animals is to keep humans away from the ecological position of the co-infector of the virus.
There are still a few gaps in the SARS-CoV-2 co-infection of the disease.
First of all, if bats transmit an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to a pedal, it makes sense to look at the circumstances in which bats and pedals can share the same ecological position.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, then how humans come into contact with bats remains to be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as a true host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and hijabs.
Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be undertaken.
In the case of bats, pedals or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be found in the natural host in the future, or almost the same as the intergenerational virus.
Continued research in this area will reveal the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
Need to update the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 "Suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases"
On February 6, 2020, our team released "Guide for rapid advice on diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 new coronary virus (2019-nCoV) infection", through which we provided lessons and lessons for the global response to the epidemic.
However, 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease, and based on ongoing research and clinical practice, our knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing; thus, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In the present letter, we respond to a comment on the above-mentioned guidelines and provide updated diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", based on the latest COVID-19 diagnostic programme issued by the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the outbreak of the new coronary virus (2019-nCoV) has now been officially named 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), which was previously named the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 coronary virus (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) classified COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
To counter SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a fast-track recommendation guide, which was posted online in the military medical research magazine on February 06, 2020.
Since its publication, it has attracted widespread attention.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new type of disease and that, based on ongoing research and clinical practice, our knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing; thus, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) released a total of 7 editions of the "COVID-19 Clinical Program" from 16 January to 3 March 2020, some of which have changed substantially.
Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou and others who have proposed a simple rating based on their own clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our guidance and valuable references to this global pandemic.
We acknowledge and thank them for their important work.
However, their proposal will also need to be updated in the light of the latest COVID-19 diagnostic programme (pilot seventh edition) and recent research.
According to the Seventh Edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspected case requires a combination of an epidemiological history characteristic with two clinical manifestations for a comprehensive analysis, and three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) Travel or residence history of a community reporting COVID-19 cases within 14 days of the onset of the symptoms; (2) exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection (nucleic acid test positive); (3) exposure history of patients from Wuhan city and surrounding areas or other communities reporting COVID-19 fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of the onset of the symptoms; (4) exposure to concentrated confirmed cases (within 2 weeks of the onset of the symptoms, within a small range of 2 cases of heat and/or respiratory symptoms, such as home, office, school class, etc.)
Clinical performance: (1) Heat and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) visual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or decreasing total number of white cells in the early onset of the disease and decreasing number of lymphocytes.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on a suspected case and have any of the following pathological or seroacological evidence: (1) real-time PCR positive detection of SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-genomic sequence of the virus showing high homogeneity with the known new coronary virus; (3) specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive, or increasing diaphragm in recovery periods by four times higher than acute periods.
As we can see, the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020) added real-time PCR nucleic acid testing in respiratory or blood samples.
The fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) increased the screening of blood specimen pathogens; and the seventh edition added seroacological evidence.
These changes are based on the continuing work of researchers to study the best nucleic acid detection reagent box for rapid diagnosis and respiratory specimens, including blood mining, which increase the availability of different specimens and provide evidence for the inclusion of positive results of specific antibodies in the diagnostic criteria.
In addition, there is growing evidence that reminds us of atypical and non-symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify people with no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
In addition, the scoring system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.
Finally, we want more direct evidence and call on readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that the latest guidelines for the country where the cases are found be consulted and followed.
Our team will update our guidelines in time to help.
Bangladesh reported 5 new cases of COVID-19 deaths, rising to a single day high
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new cases of COVID-19 deaths.
This has created a new high number of single-day deaths due to the virus.
As of yesterday, 114 cases of confirmed cases and 33 cases of cure after home rest have been recorded by the Bangladesh Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research Institute (IEDCR).
17 cumulative deaths.
In an online press conference, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, head of IEDDR, stated that these deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years of age, two cases were between 51 and 60 years of age, and one case was between 41 and 50.
She also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
A hospital officer revealed to the local news media Anadolu Agency that one of the deceased patients was Jalal Saifur Rahman, head of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who had been treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridge of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, announced via an online video that the stoppage of public transport would go beyond the original plan and be extended until Saturday.
The public transport stoppage started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Medical, basic supplies such as fuel and food are still available for normal transport.
On 8 March, of the first recorded cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Bangladesh, two returned from Italy and one patient was the wife of one of the confirmed patients.
By March 19, all three patients had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections globally
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 cases of coronary virus infection worldwide has exceeded 1 million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 deaths are related to diseases caused by the coronary virus - COVID-19.
On the same day of the milestone, Malawi confirmed the first coronary virus infection in the country and the first deaths associated with the coronary virus in Zambia.
North Korea claims that by Thursday it was one of the few countries not infected with the coronary virus.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization had reported 105,1635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 within 24 hours of 10 a.m. (0800 UTC) Central Europe time.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronary virus have been recorded, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News quotes Johns Hopkins University data that on Wednesday, coronary virus infections killed more than 1,000 people in the United States.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to curb the spread of disease.
Thursday, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin of Moscow extended the closure date until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians throughout the country would continue to be paid during the suspension until April 30th.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in Al-Quds Al-Mukarramah and Medina to a full-day curfew, which had previously been in effect only between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the home order until May 1st.
Australian stores reduced the maximum number of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian chains, Woolworths and Coles, respectively, reduced the maximum purchase of toilet paper for each of their stores to two and one packs across the country.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions are posted as messages on the register or on Facebook pages posted on the chain.
According to reports, buyers are hoarding goods out of fear of COVID-19 in case they need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the number of toilet paper deliveries to each package.
Prior to these changes, the Worldworths and Coles introduced restrictions of 4 packages per transaction on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
In his press release of 8 March, Coles reported that, following the four-pack restriction, "many shops were still sold out of stock within an hour of arrival" and called the demand "unprecedented" and Aldi called it "unexpected" in his Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworths spokesman, last week's sales had "a sharp increase".
Last week, the Costco store in Canberra also limited the number to two.
To further alleviate the shortfall, Coles ordered larger packagings from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Wolworth ordered additional stocks, and ALDI prepared stocks ahead of schedule for planned ex gratia Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, stated that retailers were trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times made this difficult.
He expected production costs to rise as suppliers tried to meet demand, while preferential activities would decrease.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores would not be able to hold a Wednesday ex gratia event.
In a report by News.com.au, a retail expert at the University of Technology in Queensland, Dr. Gary Mortimer, claims that stores are replenished every night.
He said that toilet paper was a large item and therefore had fewer stocks, and that once sold out, it would leave a huge shelf space, adding to the feeling of material shortages.
"Coles and Woolworths are of the view that if there were a lot of things on the shelf, such as rollers and hand-washing fluids, you might not be so scared. "Russell Zimmerman said to ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap manufacturer last Wednesday said they're out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who makes toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who makes soubent toilet paper, both emphasize that they are working all day and weekends to secure supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reports that some real estate operators will provide free toilet paper to the first bidder at the Melbourne auction due to the low number of auctions held by buyers on weekends of labour break.
NT News is a daily newspaper printed in Darwin City and contains eight pages in its Thursday edition, designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
ABC Australia reported on March 3 that the store was initially reluctant to enforce the purchase restrictions, and that they did not plan to impose the purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that there was also a high demand for other commodities, including masks, hand-washing fluids, dry goods, hand-washing fluids and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, Ocado of the Internet Supermarket in the United Kingdom limits the purchase of Andrés toilet paper to two packs of 12 volumes each on Sunday night.
World Health Organization declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the continuing outbreak of COVID-19 (diseases caused by the coronary virus SARS-CoV-2) to be a pandemic.
While the term "epidemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease and not to the level of risk in a given case, WHO points to the need to urge Governments to take measures to:
"All countries/regions can still change the course of this pandemic ...
If countries/regions test, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people as a response, the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says.
" We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of proliferation and severity and the alarming levels of inaction ... "
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
He commented at CNN in February, saying, "No respiratory viruses other than influenza have been discovered that continue to spread globally after their emergence. "
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view and said, "We've never seen a pandemic caused by a coronary virus before."
He went on to say, "Well, we've never seen a controlled virus epidemic before. "
Before entering the new state of the pandemic, in January, WHO identified the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said, "Most of all, it's still getting worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 globally, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
2019-2020 The coronary virus outbreak is a new type of coronary virus disease that continues to spread (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
This outbreak was confirmed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and as an epidemic on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, 210 countries and territories around the world had reported a cumulative total of approximately 16.1 million cases of COVID-19 and about 97,000 deaths.
Healing about 36.4 million people.
China has a disease death rate of about 4 per cent, while global mortality ranges from 0.08 per cent (New Zealand) to 13.04 per cent (Algeria).
Common symptoms include heat, cough and agitation.
And could be associated with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, etc.
The period of incubation from exposure to the patient to the onset of the disease varies from 2 to 14 days, usually about 5 days.
There is no vaccine or special antiviral treatment program.
Clinical treatment is based on treatment support for symptoms. Suggested precautions include hand washing, covering the mouth while coughing, keeping safe distance from others, surveillance and self-segregation of suspected infected persons.
Official authorities have taken measures to respond to travel restrictions, isolation, curfews, workplace hazards control and closure of facilities.
The global socio-economic impact of the epidemic has been severe, with the postponement or cancellation of sports, religion, political and cultural activities, while panic shopping has exacerbated the widespread supply shortage.
Globally, 193 countries and territories have introduced national or local suspensions, affecting about 99.4 per cent of primary, secondary and tertiary students.
There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asian descent-based and appearance-based groups, as well as groups in areas with severe epidemics, as a result of the dissemination of false viral information online.
However, reduced mobility and the closure of heavy industries have reduced air pollution indices and reduced carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, the health department of Wuhan, in Hubei Province, reported an unknown case of pneumonia and launched an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the wholesale market in the South China Sea, so the new coronary virus is considered common human and animal disease.
The virus that triggered the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the bat coronary virus, the mountain penetrating coronary virus and SARS-CoV. The first patient found was confirmed to have developed on 1 December 2019, with no apparent link to the subsequent cases of the China South Seafood market.
Two thirds of the early cases reported in December 2019 were confirmed to be related to the South China Seafood market.
On March 13th, 2020, the South China Morning News published an unverified report that the first case may be traced back to November 17th, 2019, with 55-year-old males from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported a decline in new reported cases in China, but for the first time in Italy, Iran and the Republic of Korea, there was a sharp increase in the number of new reported cases outside China.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially cases of light diseases.
As of February 26, there were relatively few reported cases among adolescents, with the proportion of young people aged 19 and under worldwide being only 2.4%. Patrick Valances, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that about 60% of the population needed to be infected with the new coronary virus in order to get effective group immunization.
The number of cases is the number of people tested by COVID-19 and confirmed positive according to the official program.
As of March 23, the proportion of people tested worldwide was not more than 3 per cent of the total population, and many countries have issued official policies for non-detection of people suffering from light diseases, including in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
According to a study published on March 16, as of January 23, an estimated 86 per cent of the infected people in China were not detected, and the unrecorded infections were 79 per cent of the recorded cases.
According to a statistical analysis published on 30 March, the actual number of infections in Italy is significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
COVID-19 Basic infections (R0) Initial estimates range from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by CDC shows that R0 could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients recover.
The time between illness and death is 6-41 days, 14 days most common.
As of 10 April 2020, about 97,000 people had died in COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80 per cent of deaths in China were among people over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent of deaths were accompanied by underlying diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official statistics on COVID-19 deaths usually refer to deaths with positive results of new coronary virus tests under official programmes.
The actual COVID-19 death toll may be much higher than the statistics, as it may not include patients who have not been tested, such as those who have died in their homes, nursing homes, etc.
Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is 4-5 times higher than the number of deaths from new coronary pneumonia in official statistics.
One of the female spokespersons of the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stated, "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is lower than the actual number," and anecdotal accounts of the underestimation of American data confirm this statement. Underestimating the frequency of epidemics, such as the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in 2009, the first confirmed deaths in China occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
On February 1, the first death outside China occurred in the Philippines, and on February 14, the first death outside Asia occurred in France.
As of February 28, there were more than a dozen deaths outside of China in Iran, Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. There are several ways to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region and are subject to testing, quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the onset of the first outbreak of the epidemic and the effects of demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health status.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of 10 April 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.0 per cent (97,039,617,204).
Death rates vary from region to region.
In China, the estimated incidence of disease and death has decreased from 17.3 per cent (persons affected from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (persons affected after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), which reflect the percentage of deaths from disease as a percentage of confirmed deaths, while the latter reflects the percentage of deaths from disease as a percentage of infections (including confirmed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-limited and follow the entire process from infection to case resolution for specific populations.
Many scholars try to calculate the above data for specific groups of people.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the overall rate of infection mortality from the epidemic ranges from 0.1% to 0.39%.
The upper limit of the estimated value for this range is consistent with the first random test conducted by Germany on COVID-19 and a statistical analysis of the impact of the CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization claims the epidemic is manageable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak cannot be determined and varies from region to region.
Maciej Boni, from Pennsylvania State University, says, "Uncontrolled, outbreaks of infectious diseases usually reach stagnation after the existing host has run out, and then begin to slow down.
But it's almost impossible for us to predict when the turning point will come. "
The Chinese Government's Senior Medical Adviser, Jong Namshan, believes that if all countries mobilize to adopt the World Health Organization's recommendation to take measures to stop the spread of the virus, "the end of the epidemic in June can be expected".
On March 17th, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "may explode repeatedly for a period of one to two years."
Neil Ferguson, a study led by Imperial Institute of Technology, shows that "Physical distance and other measures must be taken before a vaccine can be used" (which may take 18 months or more).
William Schaffner from the University of Vanderburg said, "This coronary virus is very contagious, and I don't think it's likely to disappear completely," and it could turn into a seasonal disease that erupts every year.
The ability to re-emerge depends on the immunity and mutation of the group.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific and some infected persons may not have symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sapling (sniffing), loss of smell, agitation, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, coldness, vomiting, edgy, diarrhea, or haemorrhage. According to the World Health Organization, about one in six patients can turn into severe diseases and have respiratory difficulties.
The United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) has classified respiratory difficulties, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden unconsciousness, difficulty in awakening and facial or lip bruising as urgent symptoms; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended that immediate medical attention be provided.... The further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, infectious shock and death.
Some of the infected persons may have no symptoms and no clinical manifestations, but the test results are positive, so researchers recommend close observation and examination of those in close contact with the identified patients to exclude the possibility of infection.
China estimates that the rate of non-symptomatic infections varies from very low to 44 per cent.
The period of incubation (the time interval between infection and onset) is usually 1-14 days; 5 days are the most common. With regard to uncertainty, one example can be given: the proportion of people with no sense of smell among COVID-19 patients was initially estimated at 30 per cent and then dropped to 15 per cent.
Some details on the route of transmission have yet to be determined.
The disease is currently believed to be transmitted mainly through close contact and cough, sneeze or foam from talking; close contact means within a distance of 1-2 metres (3-6 feet).
The study found that an unshielded cough can lead to the widest spread of foam by 4.5 m (15 feet) - 8.2 m (15-27 feet).
It has also been suggested that the prolonged stay in the air of people's speech may also lead to the spread of the virus. Although the virus is usually not air-transmitted, it can also produce foam when people exhale or speak.
It could fall into the mouths and noses of the surroundings, or even inhaled the lungs.
Medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, may mistify respiratory genres, causing air transport.
In addition, if a person touches the contaminated surface (including skin) and then touches his nose and eyes, it may cause the virus to spread.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through faeces, but the risk is considered low.
The Chinese Government denies the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 dung circulation, which is the most contagious virus in the first three days of the disease, but is also contagious before and after the disease.
Positive results can be detected at the earliest three days before the onset of the disease, indicating that the new coronary virus was contagious before the appearance of apparent symptoms.
Although very few cases of non-symptomatic cases have been reported for laboratory identification, some countries have detected no-symptomatic infections in the course of contact follow-up investigations.
According to the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC), although the transmission of the new coronary virus is not yet entirely clear, it is common for 1 person to transmit 2-3 persons. The duration of the virus's life on the surface of the object varies from hours to days.
Specifically, the new crown virus is known to survive for up to three days on plastics (polypropane) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard and for up to four hours on copper.
However, its survival is also influenced by humidity and temperature.
There is currently no evidence that animals retransmit the virus to humans, but official British authorities suggest that people wash their hands after exposure to animals, as if they were exposed to the surfaces of other potentially infected people.
The severe acute respiratory coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first isolated from three pneumonia patients in a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the natural coronary virus. Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with household soap because the soap can dissolve the virus ' s protective cyst. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Now it's considered a common disease.
Genetic analysis shows that the coronary virus is genetically associated with the beta coronary virus in the Sarbecovirus and the two Bat-source strains.
The new coronary virus and the other bat coronary virus samples (BatCov RATTG13) are 96% consistent at the whole genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found only one amino acid in some parts of the genome sequence between the virus in the mountain armour and the virus in the human body.
So far, an all-genomic comparison has revealed that at most 92 per cent of the genetic material between the mountain cape virus and SARS-CoV-2 is identical, and that it is not sufficient to prove that the man in the mountain cape is the host.
If the virus is infected, it can be diagnosed on a prima facie basis, but ultimately it can only be diagnosed by retropolymers (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected secretor.
A PCR-CT comparison study in Wuhan shows that CT is clearly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and that many imaging features overlap with other pneumonia and disease development processes.
As of March 2020, the American Society of Radiology had recommended that "it is not appropriate for CT to screen COVID-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease. "
The World Health Organization has published several nucleic acid testing programmes for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The nucleic acid test uses a real-time reversal of the polymeric chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Respiratory samples or blood samples can be used for testing.
The results are usually in a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this is done by swabs or by swabs.... A lot of laboratories and companies are developing serum tests to detect antibodies.
By April 6, 2020, none of these tests had been confirmed to be sufficiently accurate to authorize widespread use.
In the United States, the serology experiment developed by Cellex has been approved for use only by certified laboratories in emergency situations.
The typical imaging features of patients with X tablets and computer fault scans (CT) include the asymmetrical grinding of glass in the outer circle and the absence of a chest cavity fluid.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international online database on image performance of confirmed cases.
Because of the overlap with other viruses (e.g. gland virus), there is limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19 by images that have not been confirmed by PCR.
A large study in China comparing the results of the chest CT with the results of the PCR found that, although images are less specific to the identification of infection, detection is faster and more sensitive, and could therefore be considered as a screening tool for endemic areas.
An artificial intelligence-based network of condensed neurons has been developed that can be used jointly to detect the visual characteristics of the virus using X-rays and CTs.
Measures to prevent the spread of the disease include good hygiene practices, proper hand-washing, avoiding direct contact with the nose and mouth of the eye without washing hands, covering the nose and mouth with paper towels when coughing or sneezing, and throwing used paper towels directly into the trash can.
Suspected infected persons should wear medical surgical masks when entering public places.
Many Governments have restricted or recommended that they avoid the needless movement to and from countries and regions affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has now reached the community stage of transmission in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community, and some community residents have no way of knowing where or how they are infected.
The Government's use of mobile location data for tracing purposes has raised concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations such as Amnesty International have issued statements calling for restrictions on such monitoring.
Various mobile applications are currently in use or are proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions with privacy protection features, such as the use of bluetooth to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
Once the user has been in close contact with a positive patient with COVID-19 tests, it receives a message warning that there is a continuous spread of misinformation about preventing infection; it is ineffective to wash noses and mouthwash.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are actively developing it.
It's recommended to stop the spread of the disease by washing hands.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds, especially before meals and after snorting, coughing or sneezing when there's a clear stain on their hands.
This is because before entering the human body, the virus can only destroy its protective cysts by using household soap, thereby killing the virus.
The CDC also recommends that, if there is no soap or running water around, hands can be washed with at least 60% alcohol-containing hand-washing fluid.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
The surface of the object can be disinfected with a variety of solutions (the disinfection is effective within one minute of the stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorate, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% polyvetone iodine.
Other solutions (e.g., phenylammonium phenol and chlorodecorated glucate) are less effective.
CDC suggests that, in the event of new suspected or confirmed cases of coronary virus pneumonia in facilities such as offices or day care centres, all regions should be sterilized, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablet computers, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and patients ' used ATMs.
WHO recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with bending elbows or paper towels during coughing or sneezing and immediately dispose of all contaminated paper towels.
It is recommended that those suspected of infection wear a medical surgical mask, which reduces the amount of foam that can be used to speak, sneeze and cough and reduces the distance of transmission.
The World Health Organization has issued a note on the use of masks and the use of methods.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, argues that "a mask reduces the tendency for people to touch their faces, which is also a major source of infection in the absence of a healthy hand." In addition, it is recommended that the person in charge of the care of a suspected infected person wear a mask.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that health groups should wear masks only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for the care of COVID-19 patients, although it has also accepted that wearing masks helps to avoid touching their faces.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommends that healthy citizens also wear one-time medical masks, especially when they are in close contact with others (within 1 metre (3 feet)).
Hong Kong, China, proposes to wear masks when travelling in public transport or entering crowd-intensive places.
Thai health officials advise people to make their masks and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are strictly forbidden to enter public places without masks or noses.
On March 16, Viet Nam demanded that all persons should wear masks in order to have access to public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires masks for everyone to enter a grocery store.
Israel demands that all residents wear masks in public.
Since mid-March, Taiwan has produced 10 million masks a day, and on April 1st it has been required to wear masks on trains and inter-city buses.
Panama requires masks to be worn outside the country and recommends self-made masks for residents who do not have them.
Masks have been widely used in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Infective prevention and control measures related to maintaining social distance (also known as physical distance) are designed to minimize close human contact and thereby slow the spread of the disease.
Measures include segregation; travel restrictions; suspension of schools, stoppages and closure of stadiums, theatres or shopping malls.
In terms of maintaining social distance, measures that individuals can take include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding access to densely populated areas, shifting to non-contact greeting and maintaining physical distance with others.
Now, many governments have imposed or advised socialization in areas affected by the epidemic.
With regard to the largest concentration of people, the initial recommendation by United States government agencies and WHO was 250 (in areas where there is no COVID-19 transmission) and then quickly reduced to 50 and then to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings between two or more persons. Older persons and groups suffering from basic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and impaired immune system are at higher risk of serious illness and complications. The German Center for Disease Control recommended that such groups in the epidemic area should not go out as far as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health institutions began to replace the term "maintaining social distance" with "maintaining physical distance" in order to clarify that the aim was to reduce physical contact while maintaining social links, including virtual and remote contact.
The use of the term "social distance" implies that people are completely segregated from society and that people are not encouraged to use other ways to maintain human contact.... Some authorities have also issued guidelines on sexual health applicable during the pandemic.
Recommendations included sexual relations only with a partner who lives with no virus or symptoms.
Recommendation COVID-19 Self-segregation in the home of patients diagnosed with suspected infection.
Health institutions have issued detailed statements on the correct self-segregation. Many governments have imposed or recommended self-segregation for all residents of the affected areas.
In addition, the most severe self-segregation instructions were issued to high-risk populations.
If it is possible to contact a COVID-19 patient, or to travel to a country or region where there has been widespread transmission recently, it is recommended that self-segregation be initiated from the time of last possible exposure to the virus 14 days.
Epidemic prevention and control strategies include containment/repression and mitigation.
Containment applies to the early stages of an outbreak, with the aim of tracking and segregating the infected, while taking other infection prevention and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to other populations.
If it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts should be made to make the transition to mitigation: measures to slow the spread of the disease and reduce its impact on the health system and society ...
Containment and mitigation measures can be carried out simultaneously.
Repression requires more extreme precautions to reverse the epidemic by reducing the number of basic regeneratives to less than 1. Part of the effort to control the outbreak of infectious diseases is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is the epidemiological curve we know.
This would reduce the risk of collapse of health services and allow more time for the development of vaccines and treatment programmes.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can contain the epidemic include individual preventive measures, such as the maintenance of hand hygiene, the wearing of masks and self-segregation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspension of schools and the cancellation of mass rallies; community actions aimed at encouraging acceptance of and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures, such as surface cleaning. In the face of a clearly increased epidemic, China immediately took tougher containment measures, such as sealing cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries and regions have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Republic of Korea introduced large-scale screening and local isolation measures and issued an alert on the movement trajectory of the infected.
Singapore provides financial support for self-segregated infections and imposes heavy fines on those who refuse to segregate themselves.
Taiwan, China, has increased mask production and imposed penalties on suppliers of medical supplies sold at ease. Simulations in the United Kingdom and the United States have shown that both mitigation (mitigating but not halting the spread of the epidemic) and containment (reverting the spread of the epidemic) are major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak health needs by two thirds and reduce deaths by half, but may still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Repression may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus ceases to spread among the population (or until the vaccine is introduced, whichever is first), otherwise the spread will rebound quickly once the measure is relaxed.
Long-term interventions aimed at containing the pandemic have social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development is ongoing, including testing of existing drugs.
The use of non-prescribed cold medicine, rehydration and rest may help to alleviate the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, IVS and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids could lead to a deterioration of the situation.
A number of compounds previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied to determine their applicability for treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also noted that some "traditional and family therapy" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
According to the World Health Organization, improving processing capacity and adapting the medical system to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is the basic response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe issued guidance on hospital and primary health care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the elimination of selective procedures wherever possible, the segregation and segregation of COVID-19 positive patients, and the enhancement of intensive care capacity through the training of personnel and the increase in the number of respirators and beds available.
There's a lot of speculation about the origin of the first case (so-called Patient Zero).
The first known case of a new coronary virus pneumonia may date back to December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of new coronary virus cases in Hubei Province increased.
Most of these patients were associated with the South China Sea Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory suggests that the new coronary virus originates in one of these animals; in other words, it originates in a common human and animal disease. On December 26, Zhang Zhang, the doctor at the Midwest Medical Union Hospital in Hubei Province, first discovered and treated an unknown group of pneumonia patients and reported it to the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in the Jianghan district of Wuhan City on December 27th.
On December 30th, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "capitarian virus like SARS".
Eight doctors, including Li Wenqing, were warned by the police for spreading rumours, while another doctor, Eiffen, was warned by his superiors for provoking alarms.
The Wuhan City Health Board subsequently issued an announcement on 31 December and reported to the World Health Organization.
Following reports of numerous cases of pneumonia for unknown reasons, the Wuhan health department launched an investigation in early January, which doubled the number of cases every seven and a half days in the early days of the outbreak.
Between the beginning of January and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China as a result of the mass movement of Chinese people during the Spring Festival and the use of Wuhan as a transportation hub and main railway hub.

Three soldiers tested the virus to be positive, and all Korean military bases have been isolated since then.
The flight schedule has also been adjusted for the impact of the epidemic. Korea has launched what is considered the largest worldwide, best organized virus control program, which is to screen large numbers of people for viruses, isolate all infected persons, and track and isolate people in close contact with those infected.
Screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new entrants from abroad through mobile applications, free-off virus testing, with results available the following day, while increasing detection capacity to accommodate up to 20,000 people per day.
Although there is no city-wide isolation, South Korea’s plans are considered successful in preventing the epidemic. Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude to the President’s crisis response.

The initial British response to the virus was considered to be the most relaxed of the affected countries... until March 18, 2020, when the British Government began to impose various forms of social distance or mass isolation on its citizens.
As a result, the British Government was criticized for its lack of speed and strength in responding to public concerns.

The World Health Organization commends the Chinese authorities for their efforts to prevent and control the epidemic.
The World Health Organization has noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak and the current crisis. In the SARS outbreak, the Chinese authorities were accused of concealing the facts, impeding prevention and containment efforts, while in the current crisis, the central government "has begun to update the situation regularly before the New Year holiday in order to avoid panic."
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central Government to impose a closure measure on Wuhan, WHO representatives expressed the view that, although this was not a recommendation of the World Health Organization, it was also "amply demonstrated the determination to contain the spread of the epidemic from the areas most affected by the epidemic" and called it an "unprecedented public health" initiative. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak of public health emergencies that constituted international concern, the sixth international public health emergency since the beginning of the swine flu pandemic in 2009.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tandese, pointed out that public health emergencies of international concern were identified on the basis of "global communication risks, especially to low- and middle-income countries with inadequate health systems".
In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tandese stated that "there is no reason to take measures to intervene unnecessarily in international travel and trade" and that "the World Trade Organization does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement".
On 5 February, the World Health Organization called on the international community to contribute $675 million to support the strategic preparedness of low-income countries, stating that there is an urgent need to support countries that "have no supporting system to test those infected with the virus".
Tandese further issued a statement claiming that "the weakest link determines how powerful we are" and urging the international community to "involve immediately, or at greater cost in the future." On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified the disease at a press conference as COVID-19.
On the same day, Tandese stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed that "the United Nations will respond fully to the outbreak".
To this end, the United Nations has launched the United Nations Crisis Management Team to coordinate the United Nations-wide response. The World Health Organization has indicated that this would allow WHO to "focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to respond to the wider social, economic and development impact of the epidemic".
On February 14, the joint mission of China, led by the World Health Organization, was launched to field international and World Health Organization experts from China to assist in responding to home-grown epidemics and to assess "the severity and infectiousness of the disease" through seminars and meetings with key national agencies, and to assess "the impact of provincial and county-level responses, including the different situations in urban and rural areas". On February 25, the World Health Organization announced that "the world should make a greater effort to prepare adequately for a possible coronary virus epidemic", noting that, while it was too early to call it a pandemic, countries should be "ready".
In response to the growing epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission to the country to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials stated that the global risk level of the coronary virus outbreak had been elevated from "high" to "high", which was the highest alert and risk level of the assessment method.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the Health Emergency Project of the World Health Organization, warned in a statement: "This is a reality check for Governments around the world: Wake up.
The virus may be approaching, please be prepared, and urge governments to take the right response to avoid a global "worst scenario".
Ryan further noted that the current data is not sufficient to allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, which would mean that "we basically recognize that all people on Earth may be exposed to the virus. "
On March 11, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of a new coronary virus constituted a global pandemic.
According to the Director-General of the World Health Organization, "Expressing deep concern about the underlying proliferation and severity and the reality of inaction", the World Health Organization has been heavily criticized for its perceived mishandling of the global pandemic, including the delay in declaring public health emergencies and classifying the virus as a global pandemic.
Among the more powerful oppositions was the petition requesting Tedros Adhanom, Director-General of the World Health Organization, to resign, which, as of 6 April, had been signed by 733,000 people.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the need to respect the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Group notes that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that Governments should assume this responsibility ...
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be grounds for discrimination against specific groups ...
The experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minors, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, groups living in extremely poor conditions, detainees and refugees and other unidentified groups requiring government support.
International governmental organizations are actively addressing the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform aimed at providing timely and comprehensive information, views and recommendations on policy responses across the world.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to addressing the impact of the embargo and travel restrictions, the Centre has a national policy tracking system designed to help countries learn from each other and to promote global collaboration to address the challenges of the new coronary virus.
Because of the initial outbreak of the pandemic in Hubei Province, China, the United States, the British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Goff and the son of President Yail Bosonaro of Brazil, Eduardo Bosonaro, criticized the Chinese Government for its approach.
Several Chinese Communist Party (CPC) provincial administrators have been dismissed for improper handling of the epidemic in China, reflecting the central dissatisfaction with the response to the epidemic in local political institutions.
According to some commentators, this is intended to avoid public discontent with the CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping as a result of the outbreak of the new coronary virus.
Some Chinese officials (e.g. Zhao Lijin) denied the previously admitted outbreak of COVID-19, which started in Wuhan, and supported the conspiracy theory that the new coronary virus pneumonia originated in the United States or Italy.
United States President Donald Trump called the new coronary virus "China virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that China's "censorship system has increased the spread of the virus and made it the current global pandemic", which in turn has been perceived by some critics as a form of racial discrimination and has diverted attention from its government's failure to contain the virus.
"The Beast of the Day" received a telegram from the United States Government outlining a communication strategy apparently issued by the National Security Council, which says, "It's all connected to China.
We have been told in any way, including press conferences and television appearances, to spread this message as far as possible. " Politicians," "Foreign policy" and media such as Bloomberg claim that China's assistance to the epidemic countries is intended to promote their global influence.
Joseph Borrell, head of European Union foreign policy, warned that there was a "geopolitical factor that includes good offices and "grateful politics" to gain influence."
Borrel also said, "China is promoting it as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States. "
China also called on the United States to lift the sanctions imposed on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and allegedly provided assistance to the latter two countries.
On April 3, Mayun donated 100,000 masks to Cuba that were blocked by United States sanctions.
The U.S. authorities have also been accused of transferring aid to other countries.
Mask disputes were also reported between Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as between the Czech Republic and Italy, among others.
In addition, Turkey intercepted hundreds of breathing machines destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU for its insufficient support for Italy affected by the new coronary virus.
The Italian Ambassador to the European Union, Maurizio Massari, said, "Only China has responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity. "
On March 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin, after speaking with Italian Prime Minister Conte, arranged for the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfectors and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper quoted an anonymous "high-ranking political official" saying that 80% of Russia's aid was "almost useless to Italy".
The source accused Russia of launching the "geopolitics and diplomacy" charade.
Attilo Fontana, Governor of Lombardi, and Luigi Di Maio, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, rejected the media coverage and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said: "[Putin], in providing assistance to his American colleagues, believes that once the United States manufacturers of medical equipment and materials return to production, they will be rewarded if necessary. "
The NATO Defenders 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea are the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the cold war, and will be reduced in size.
Kate Hudson, Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Movement, criticized the "Defence 2020" exercise: "In the face of a global public health crisis, the exercise endangers not only the lives of the military personnel of the United States and many of the participating European countries, but also the inhabitants of the countries where the exercise took place." The Iranian government was seriously affected by the epidemic, with some 24 parliamentarians and 15 other current or former politicians infected.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders requesting assistance. The letter stated that the United States sanctions against Iran prevented Iran from gaining access to international markets and made it difficult to combat the epidemic. The outbreak prompted calls for social policies that are common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child health care, paid family visits and increased public health funding.
Political analysts predict that the epidemic could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's re-election to the 2020 presidential election. Foreign relations between Japan and Korea have also deteriorated as a result of the global pandemic.
Japan announced that every person entering from Korea would be subjected to a two-week quarantine at a government-designated location, and then criticized Japan for its "unambitious and passive quarantine measure".
Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude towards the President’s crisis response.
Many South Koreans signed the petition, some impeached, accused the government of mishandling the epidemic, and others praised his response. The pandemic prompted many countries to pass emergency legislation as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this might lead the government to tighten its grip on power.
In Hungary, the Parliament voted in favour of Prime Minister Orbán Victor taking office indefinitely by decree, suspending Parliament and elections and penalizing anyone who is found to have disseminated false information about the virus and government crisis management.
The multiple supply shortages can be attributed to the outbreak of the new coronary virus, which stems from the increased use of equipment, panic shopping and disruption of plant and logistics operations in the global fight against the epidemic.
The U.S. Food and Drug Regulatory Authority issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of supply.
In many places, panic shopping has led to the emptying of essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water on shelves, resulting in shortages of supplies.
The technology industry, in particular, has been warning of delays in the delivery of electronics.
According to World Health Organization Director General Tandese, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
As a result of this demand, the price of these products has risen 20 times higher than usual, and the supply of medical supplies has been delayed by 4 to 6 months.
The World Health Organization warns that this will pose a threat to medical personnel.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for surrogates to sell Australian products to China.
This activity resulted in a shortage of formula formulas for some supermarket babies, which were banned by the Australian Government. Although COVID-19 in northern Italy and Wuhan was very serious, there was no severe food shortage in either area.
Measures taken by China and Italy to address the accumulation of and illegal trade in key products have been very successful, avoiding serious food shortages, which are expected to occur in Europe and North America.
Agricultural production in northern Italy has not declined significantly, but industry representatives believe that prices may rise.
The clearing of food shelves is only temporary, even in Wuhan, where Chinese government officials have released pork reserves in order to guarantee adequate nutrition for the population.
There are similar legal provisions in Italy that require food producers to supply stocks for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy has had an impact on China: a media report on March 16, states that, in the first two months of 2020, China ' s economy was hit by a massive shock, with retail sales falling by 20.5 per cent.
Since mainland China is the world's leading economic and manufacturing centre, the outbreak of the virus is seen as a major threat to global economic stability.
According to Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit, the market will remain unstable until there is a clearer understanding of the possible consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative impact of the outbreak on global economic growth could be greater than the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An expert from the University of Washington, St. Louis, estimates that the impact of the epidemic on the global supply chain will be over $300 billion, possibly for up to two years.
It was reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was "in a difficult position" after the sharp drop in oil prices as a result of the fall in demand in China.
On February 24, the global stock market fell as a result of a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, the population ' s concern about the new coronary virus epidemic increased, with the largest drop since 2008 in the United States stock index of 1,191 points, the largest single-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis, including the NASDA 100 index, the Standard Pul 500 index and the Dow Jones industry average index.
The three indices dropped by 10% or more that week.
On February 28, Spope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The public's concern about the new coronary virus caused the stock market to crash again, with the biggest drop on March 16th.
The recession is considered by many as an event of probability.
The economist Mohamed El-Erian praised central banks and states for taking urgent measures in a timely manner.
Central banks reacted faster than the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism has become one of the most affected industries under the travel ban, the closure of public places such as tourist attractions and government recommendations to avoid the impact of travel.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airlines, East China Airlines and Australian Airlines, have cancelled their flights due to falling demand, while British branch Airlines, Flybe, has unfortunately collapsed.
The cruise industry suffered more than ever before.
Multiple railway stations and ferry ports have been shut down.
The epidemic coincided with the spring season of China, which was an important tourist season.
National and local governments cancelled a series of events involving crowd gathering, including the annual Spring Festival, and private businesses closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's activities and tourist attractions (including the Beijing Palace and the traditional temples) have been cancelled and closed to prevent large-scale crowds.
In China ' s 31 provinces, 24 municipalities and autonomous regions have extended New Year ' s leave to 10 February, requiring most enterprises not to return to work before that date.
These regions account for 80 per cent of GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong, China, raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, with schools suspended until March and New Year's celebrations cancelled.
Retail stores in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
Retail stores in North America and the Middle East declined by 50-60 per cent.
In addition, the epidemic caused the mall to lose 33-43 per cent in March compared to February.
The world's shopping mall operators have taken additional measures, such as increasing sanitation facilities, installing heat scanners to measure the temperature of the shoppers, and eliminating some activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could lead to 14 million to 22 million more people living in extreme poverty in Latin America than in the absence of the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people were unemployed in China.
There are nearly 300 million rural workers in China, many of whom are confined to their homes in the interior provinces or in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans were unemployed and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, a new coronary virus epidemic could lead to 47 million job losses in the United States, with a possible unemployment rate of 32 per cent. India’s blockade has led to the unemployment of tens of millions of Indian migrant workers. The Angus Reed Institute found that 44 per cent of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment assistance, and 1 million British workers applied for a general benefit. Germany's nearly half a million companies used government-subsidized reduced hours of work for their employees.
France and the United Kingdom have also adopted Germany's reduced working hours compensation system.
The performance and cultural industries have also been devastated by the epidemic, with organizations operating worldwide and employees and individuals not spared.
The Organization of the Artistic and Cultural Industries strives to uphold its mission (usually funded by the Government) to show the cultural heritage to the community, to maintain the safety of its employees and the public, and to provide as much support as possible to artists.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, performing venues and other cultural institutions around the world had been closed indefinitely to varying degrees, with the original exhibition, events and performances having to be cancelled or postponed.
In response to this situation, efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The epidemic has also led to the recent cancellation of a number of religious services, major sporting and other social events (such as music festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion shows), and this negative impact is rapidly increasing.
The film industry was also affected by the announcement by the Vatican that the Holy Week would be cancelled in Rome during the last week of the Christian Quarter.
Many parishes advise older Christians to stay at home and not to attend mass on Sunday; some churches hold services on radio, live online or television, and others allow worship in cars.
As a result of the closure of their churches and churches in the Roman Catholic district, no Christian pilgrims were seen on St. Peter ' s Square, and other religious groups cancelled or restricted worship or limited public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and pedagogues.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and the subsequent closure of holy sites, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic has caused the worst damage to the world sports agenda since the Second World War.
Most major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 European Championship League, 2019-20 British Super League, 2020 European Championship League, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 National Hockey Federation season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics scheduled for the end of July; on March 24, the IOC announced that the event would be "rescheduled beyond 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gaming sites around the world were closed and the field poker competition had to be postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to turn to online gambling, and many online gambling sites have reported a significant increase in their new enrolments. The entertainment industry has also been affected, and various music groups have suspended or cancelled their concerts.
Many large theatres, like Broadway, have suspended all performances.
Some artists have also managed to continue to create and share their work through the Internet to replace traditional live performances, such as live concerts, or to create a network of festivals for artists to perform, distribute and promote their work.
On the Internet, a lot of web-based memes have spread around the theme of a new coronary virus, and at a time when uncertainty is spreading, a lot of people are turning to humor and diversion.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, xenophobia and racial discrimination have increased against Chinese, East Asian and European, United States and other hotspots.
Many countries and regions, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have experienced incidents of fear, suspicion and hatred.
Numerous reports from February this year (when most cases were still limited to China) documented the racist sentiments of different groups around the world towards Chinese people who believed that they should be infected with the virus or accept so-called legitimate reprisals.
There has also been an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment in some African countries.
According to reports, many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have been subjected to geographical discrimination.
Both offline and offline, there are voices in support of the Chinese and the residents of the affected areas.
As the epidemic spreads to other hotspot countries, Italy became the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, where populations from that country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, etc., initially signed a petition requesting that Chinese be barred from entering the country in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the topic #ChinaDontcomeToJapan was widely disseminated on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States report increasing racial abuse and attacks.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, has been criticized for calling the new coronary virus the "China virus", and critics believe that there is racial discrimination and anti-Chinese tendencies in his speech.
Ukrainian protesters attacked a bus from Wuhan to New Sanzari with Ukrainian and foreign evacuees.
Students from north-east India (on the border with China) and attending major cities in India were also reportedly harassed by the outbreak of a new coronary virus.
The President of the Indian People ' s Party of West Bengal, Dilip Gosh, claims that the Chinese have destroyed nature, "so God will avenge them."
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta as "mistake." In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination against non-Chinese residents were also exacerbated by the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and should be targeted for "waste disposal".
Many newspapers with pay-walls removed the pay-wall restrictions for some or all of the reports about the new coronary virus.
A number of scientific publishers have published scientific papers on the epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings quickly on preprint servers like BioRxiv.

2019 Respiratory coronary virus disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus laboratory testing methods include detection of the existence of the virus and the emergence of an antibody after the infection.
RT-PCR detects the RNA of the coronary virus and then determines whether the virus is present in the sample.
This test is a special test for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It can be used to determine whether or not there is a recent infection or if there is an active infection.
Antibody testing (serotest) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Antibodies tests show how many people are infected with the virus, including those with mild, unreported or non-symptomatic symptoms.
The results of this test determine the exact death rate of the disease and the level of immunization of the population.
Due to the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country/region has been able to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, none of the countries/areas had over 3 per cent of their population tested, and the number of countries/areas tested varied considerably.
This disparity may also have a serious impact on reported case mortality rates, which in some countries can be significantly overestimated.
Real-time RRT-PCR testing using throat swabs to obtain reliable results only in the first week after infection.
As a rule, the results can be obtained within hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing using swabs can only produce reliable results in the first week after infection.
After that, the virus disappeared in the throat but continued to breed in the lungs.
For those infected who are tested in the second week of infection, the sample may be replaced with a deep respiratory extract obtained through a snorting tube, or cough can be used.
In January 2020, RRT-PCR was released at Charité Hospital in Berlin, one of the early PCR tests, and became the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed a test. On January 28, 2020, the Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-level SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).
In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed 2019 new types of coronary virus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panels to public health laboratories.
The early version of the test reagent box used three genetic tests, one of which resulted in uncertainty about the results due to reagent defects, while at the same time there were detection bottlenecks at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average number of samples successfully processed per day of less than 100 throughout February 2020.
The two-part test was not confirmed until February 28, 2020, when the state and local labs were allowed to start testing.
The U.S. Commercial Laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
LabCorp announced that COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR could be conducted nationwide from March 5th, 2020.
Quest Diagnostics similarly announced that a nationwide COVID-19 test would be available from March 9, 2020.
Undeclared quantitative limits; sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CTC ...
In Russia, COVID-19 testing is the responsibility of the National Centre for Research in Virusology and Biotechnology (VECTOR) for development and production.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federation Health Supervisory Authority. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Meo Clinic had developed a reagent box for detection of COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA, which could complete a large number of tests within 3.5 hours, so that an equipment could be tested approximately 4,128 times within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency access authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing using the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21st, 2020, a 45-minute test by Cepheid was similarly authorized for emergency use by the FDA.
The FDA has approved a method of testing using thermo-enrichment techniques such as nucleic acid in lieu of PCR.
Because the method does not require a series of warming cycles, positive results can be obtained in only five minutes and negative results can be determined in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such devices in the United States, and Abbott is expected to increase production so that 50,000 tests can be provided every day. Taiwan is developing a test method for the use of single cloned antibodies (specifically combined with the new coronary virus ' s nuclear shell protein (N protein)), hoping that it will be able to provide the results in 15 to 20 minutes, as in the case of rapid influenza.
A review of the literature in March 2020 concluded that "at the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of the chest plate is very small, and the performance of the CT [computer fault scan] may be obvious, even before the symptoms appear."
Typical features of CT include double lung multileaf grinding glass, with asymmetrical and rear parts.
As the disease progresses, it will develop subpleural visibility, gravel trails and lung dynamics.
A PCR and CT study comparing Wuhan (the initial outbreak of the current pandemic) shows that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but CT is less precise and that many of its visual features overlap with other pneumonia and disease.
As of March 2020, the American Radiology Institute recommended that "CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as a front-line test tool for diagnosing COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDC has recommended using PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections about seven days after the beginning of the symptoms to determine the immunisation of the monitored population. The tests can be performed at the central laboratory (CLT) or through immediate testing (PoCT).
The high-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories are capable of doing this, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.
For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked through a sequence sample, it is usually measured using an external blood sample.
For PoCT, skin piercing is usually used to obtain a blood sample.
This is different from the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved the testing methods declared by 29 entities, which are now able to distribute their anti-medical test kits.
By April 7, 2020, only one test had been approved by the FDA under the emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, the test kits of the Emmon Medical Experimental Diagnostics Company and Epitope Diagnostics were approved in Europe, and these kits were available for the detection of viruses in blood samples, IgG and Iga antibodies.
There are hundreds of samples that can be tested within hours, so on the RNA, it's much faster than the traditional PCR.
In general, 14 days after the infection began to detect the antibodies, and in early April, the UK found that none of the anti-medical test kits it purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has set up a home-based mechanism for suspected patients, "sample test tubes in the emergency room", where patients throw up saliva into the tube and send back the test tube, and later receive the results. The UK NHS announced that it was piloting a home-based testing programme for suspected cases, which would eliminate the risk that patients would become infected with others when they went to hospital, and would eliminate the risk that patients would have to be sterilized with ambulances after they used the ambulance. In case of non-evacuation of COVID-19 suspected cases, medical professionals could take appropriate precautions to extract samples.
Free-of-the-carrying testing centres have helped South Korea to conduct the most extensive tests more quickly than any other country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians stated on 2 March that non-residential institutions had the capacity to conduct approximately 12,000 tests per day, 10,700 in the previous week.
If the test is performed at the doctor's request, the cost is covered by health insurance...
According to the Director of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, free-off testing had been provided in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only the number of persons whose results were positive was reported.
An initial laboratory survey showed that, as of the twelfth week of 2020, at least 483,295 samples had been tested (including the twelfth week of 2020), and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) had been detected. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing 64 patients' samples simultaneously, i.e., aggregate samples and further testing only when the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, the Great Gene (BGI) temporarily established an emergency testing laboratory for 2000 called Fire Eye, which became operational on 5 February 2020 and was capable of handling more than 10,000 samples per day.
The laboratory was built under the supervision of the founder of the Great Gene of China in five days, and modelling shows that if the above detection capability was not achieved, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher and the corresponding quarantine costs would have doubled.
After Wuhan Laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately established the Fire Eye Laboratory, which is now being established in 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, laboratory testing daily fluxes totalled 50,000 copies per day. The Open Source, Multi-road Design, published by Origami Assays, allows COVID19 detection of up to 1122 patient samples by 93 measurements alone. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without automatic fluid removal.
By March, reagent shortages and shortages had become obstacles to large-scale testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some of the sponsors to explore a sample preparation programme involving heating the sample to 98 °C (208 °F) for up to five minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the United Arab Emirates announced that new coronary virus testing had now been carried out for a larger population than any other country and that testing levels were being expanded to allow large numbers of people to be tested.
The way to achieve this capability is to use free-trough testing, on the one hand, and to fund the Group 42 and the Chinese gene (based on its "Fireeye" emergency testing laboratory in China) to establish high-throughput laboratories to respond to mass detection needs.
The laboratory was built in 14 days, capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, and was the first one in the world to operate on such a scale outside China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States have developed different tests for various parts of the gene spectrum of the coronary virus.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing reagent boxes to send reagent boxes to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own reagent boxes.
The German methodology was published on January 17, 2020; the program developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was to be used only after January 28, thus limiting United States detection capabilities. Both China and the United States experienced problems with the reliability of test kits in the early stages of the outbreak, and the two countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the needs and the recommendations of health experts for testing.
On the contrary, experts believe that extensive testing in Korea can help reduce the spread of the new coronary virus.
Thanks to the testing capacity established by the Korean government over the past few years, it is concentrated in private sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programmes as the best way to slow the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The widespread spread of the virus has led to a very high demand for testing, which has left hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States and has started to strain the availability of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test reagent box.
In the United States, the test reagent box developed by the CDC was "defective"; the government subsequently removed bureaucratic barriers to private laboratory testing. Spain purchased the test box from the Chinese company Shenzhen Erie Biotechnology Ltd. and found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explained that the inaccuracy of the test results could have been caused by the incorrect collection of samples or the wrong use of the test reagent box.
The Spanish Cabinet has indicated that it will recover the reagent box that returned the wrong result and replace it with another reagent box provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China were found to be incorrect. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China, and the results were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that these test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that Turkey had "high error rates" in the test boxes purchased from China and did not "put them into use." The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test boxes from China, which were declared unusable in April 2020.
Testing and segregation of persons who test positive results and tracking the history of exposure of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons can have positive effects.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò (the first case of COVID-19 in Italy) conducted two rounds of testing for a total population of about 3,400 people, approximately 10 days apart.
About half of them detected positive and non-symptomatic, and all detected cases were isolated.
The total elimination of new infections was achieved through community mobility restrictions.
Through large-scale tracking of contacts, restriction of travel, detection and isolation, 2020 coronary virus infection in Singapore is much slower than in other developed countries/regions, and Singapore has not imposed extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Singapore cancelled a lot of activities, and on March 28, it started advising residents to stay at home, but the school resumed on March 23, after the holiday.
Other countries/areas, such as Ireland and the Republic of Korea, have also managed to contain the epidemic through large-scale tracking of contacts, restrictions on entry travel, detection and isolation, and less radical closure measures.
A statistical study found that the lower the case mortality rate in countries where the number of people tested was higher than the number of deaths, possibly because those countries were better able to detect groups with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with limited experience in COVID-19 treatment at the national level that do not have detection capabilities send their first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for validation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the "test positive %" column is influenced by the national testing policy.
In other cases of the same conditions, the rate of positive detection is higher in countries that only test hospitalizations compared to countries that test all citizens, whether or not symptoms appear.
Hand-washing, also known as hand-cleaning, is the act of cleaning hands by removing dust, grease, microbes or other useless substances from their hands.
Insisting on hand washing with soap at certain "critical moments of the day" prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be transmitted through manure-mouth channels.
If people do not wash their hands before they touch their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucus), they may also be exposed to respiratory diseases such as influenza or common flu.
Five critical moments in the day when you must wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, before treating food, before treating raw meat, fish or poultry.
In the absence of soap and water, the hand can be cleaned with grass-wood ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands in the following cases:
Before, during and after the preparation of the food.
Before and after taking care of the patient.
After changing diapers or cleaning children's buttocks.
Sneak, cough or sneeze.
Touch animals, animal food or animal excrement.
Manual hygiene for medical personnel refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands prior to prescription or medical care prevents or minimizes the spread of the disease ...
In the medical field, the main purpose of hand-washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms capable of causing disease) and chemical substances that may harm human beings or cause disease on hand.
handwashing is particularly important for people working in food processing or in the medical field, but it is also a very important practice for the public.
There are many health benefits from handwashing, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;
And reducing infant mortality during childbirth at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices have contributed slightly to an increase in the height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by advocating simple behavioural changes (e.g., handwashing with soap).
This simple behavior can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Promoting hand-washing as an intervention can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by about one third, with the effect of providing clean water sources in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap can reduce diarrhoea cases by 48%. As spontaneous behaviour in households, schools and communities around the world, handwashing with soap is the most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhoeal and acute respiratory infections.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, with pneumonia taking the lives of about 1.8 million children every year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund (UNICEF) has indicated that, compared to any single vaccine or medical intervention, making hand-washing with soap and toilet after meals a deeply entrenched habit can save more lives, reducing diarrhoea-related deaths by nearly half and acute respiratory infections by one quarter.
As part of the Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project, hand-washing is often accompanied by other hygiene interventions.
Washing hands also prevents sepsis from spreading through direct physical contact.
Handwashing can have a slight adverse effect, i.e. frequent hand washing can lead to dry skin, resulting in skin damage.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand-washing can cause skin itching, cracking, known as hand-wet rash or hand-skin disease, which is particularly common among health-care workers.
The excessive frequency of hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of the OCD.
In order to reduce the disease's manure-mouth spread, it is essential to wash hands with soap at five critical moments in the day: after a toilet (pee, defecation), after cleaning a child's buttocks (replacement of diapers), before feeding the child, before eating, before handling food, or after treating raw meat, fish or poultry.
To prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing should also be carried out in the correct manner in cases of: treatment of the cut or wound; sneezing, coughing or snotting; touching of animal excrement or treatment of animals; and exposure to garbage.
In many countries/regions, the use of soap to wash hands is low.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7 per cent of households used the practice of handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate, 97 per cent; the United States was close to the average, 77 per cent; and China had the lowest proportion, 23 per cent. There are now several ways of changing behaviour to promote handwashing with soap at a critical time. For children to develop handwashing habits, developing countries could choose to allow school children to set a daily collective handwashing.
The Basic Health Care Programme launched by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and schooling.
At the heart of this national plan is deworming twice a year, supported by daily handwashing with soap and brushing with fluorine toothpaste.
In Indonesia, the project has also been successfully implemented.
Integrating soap or detergents in water allows better removal of skin microorganisms.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to reduce solubility barriers and improve solubility.
The use of water alone is not effective in cleaning skin because fat and proteins (parts of organic soil) are not soluble in water.
However, cleaning hands requires reasonable water ...
Solid soap, because it can be reused, may save bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies investigated the movement of bacteria from contaminated solid soap and concluded that bacteria could not be transferred because they were washed away by foam.
But CDC still says, "Better use non-exposure liquid soap."
Antibacterial soaps have been promoted in a healthy and conscious public.
So far, there is no evidence that antibiotic resistance microorganisms in nature have been selected using recommended antibacterials or disinfectants.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as trichlorfon, which has a large strain of resistant microbes.
So, even if antibacterial soaps are not selected for antibiotic resistance strains, antibacterial soaps may not be as effective as propaganda.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulations may also contain acids (acetylic acids, antiflammated acids, lactated acids), anti-bacterial active phenylacetic acids, and more skin decompositions (gills, vitamins, mint alcohol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health shows that common soaps have the same effect as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps with trichloride in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands.
Hot water washes hands, but it's not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria breed very quickly under the temperature of the body (37°C).
However, hot soap is more effective than cold soap in removing natural oils containing soil and bacteria.
Scientific research has confirmed that the use of warm water is ineffective in reducing microorganisms on hand, contrary to the prevailing view.
Handwashing free of water or bacterium washing free is a non-water-based hand cleaning agent.
At the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the twenty-first century, non-water-based alcohol hand cleaning agents (also known as alcohol handwashing, free from blubber or free from baptism) were popular.
Most of the formulations for hand-washing fluids contain isopropanol or ethanol, and are then added to denser agents such as Capom (propylene polymers) to form gels, or to pre-humid agents such as glycerine to form liquids, or foam to make them easy to use, and to relieve alcohol-induced skin dryness.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide can further increase antibacterial activity... at least 60 to 95% of the alcohol free handwashing fluids can effectively kill the virus.
Alcohol hysteria can kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory combination virus (RSV), nasal virus, cowpox, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
After 30 seconds, 70% of the alcohol handwashing fluid can kill 99.97% of the bacteria in the hand (reduced by 3.5 orders of magnitude, similar to 35 dB), and within 1 minute, the scavenger can reduce the bacteria in the hand 99.99% to 99.9999% (4 to 5 orders of magnitude). Free shampoo is most effective for bacteria, while the effects for some viruses are slightly worse.
Alcoholic handwashing has little effect on viruses such as Norovirus, also known as Novak, Norwalk, which are the most common cause of infecting gastrointestinal inflammation.
Wash the heart and back of the hand and the end of the finger and all the fingers for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel drys up.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hands should be washed instead of free handwashing fluids, especially when the hands look dirty.
This type of hand-washing fluid is increasingly being used because it is easy to use and can quickly disable micro-organisms; however, it should not be a substitute for proper hand-washing unless there is no soap and water available ...
Frequent use of alcohol free hand washing fluids can cause the skin to dry, unless a skin moisturizer and/or wetting agent is added to the formulation.
Glycerine and/or other skin moistants may be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate alcohol-induced dry skin ...
In clinical trials, alcohol free-washing hand-washing liquids with skin morbidants can significantly reduce skin irritation and drying compared to soap or antibacterial cleaners.
Allergy to skin inflammation, exposure to measles syndrome or to additives in alcohol or alcohol handwashing fluids is rare.
The low probability of alcohol free of hand washing to induce irritating contact with dermatitis compared to handwashing with soap and water is one of the reasons why it is attractive.
Waterless detergents, though effective, do not remove organic matter from hand, but only disinfect it.
As a result, hand-washing is less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens than soap and water, because these pathogens are still in hand.
The efficacy of a non-alcoholic hand-washing fluid depends to a large extent on the composition and formulation, which has historically been much less effective than alcohol and alcohol hand-washing fluids.
Recently, formulations that use PPC ammonium have been shown to be persistent and cumulatively antibacterial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, probably due to gradual adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can replace it with grass and dust.
It's better to wash your hands with grass, ash or dirt than with water alone, but not with soap.
One of the problems is that if soil or grass ashes are contaminated by microorganisms, the spread of disease can be accelerated rather than slowed down.
Like soap, grass-wood ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution after meeting water.
WHO suggests that if soap is not available, it can be replaced by grass-wood ash or sand.
The steps recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the correct hand-washing method to prevent the spread of the disease are as follows:
Get your hands wet with the flow of warm or cold water.
It's recommended that the water flow is due to the potential contamination of the stand-up basin, and the temperature of the water does not seem to be relevant.
Use a full amount of soap to wash up in order to create a bubble, while cleaning the back, the fingernails and the nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and research shows that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of water alone.
At least 20 seconds to wash.
Scavengers create friction, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, the longer the washing takes, the more bacteria are removed.
Full wash with running water.
Washing your hands from the water basin will cause re-contaminated contamination.
Dry with clean towels or dry naturally.
A thumb, wrist, area between fingers, and nail stitches are the most neglected parts of the world.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish could hide microbes.
It is usually recommended to use wet emulsion to avoid hand drying; dry skin can cause skin damage, thus increasing the risk of infection spreading.
Where piped water and/or soap is not available in developing countries, low-cost measures can be made available to facilitate hand-washing, for example, by pouring water through a hanging barrel or perforated argon, and/or washing hands using grass-grain ash (where necessary). In cases where water supplies are limited (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), hand-washing programmes for water-saving purposes, such as simple taps and other low-cost methods, can be used.
The simple tap technique is simple, hanging a can of water with a rope, then pouring a small amount of water to the hand through a pedal, then using soap.
Effective drying of hands is an important step in the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective way of doing hands in public health.
More and more studies show that paper towels are more hygienic than electric dryphones available in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium in the paper towel industry, comparing the sanitary level with paper towels, warm wind dryphones and more modern jet dryphones.
After washing their hands, drying their hands with a warm wind dryphone showed an average increase of 194% in the total volume of bacteria on their fingers and 254% on the average in the total number of bacteria on their hands.
On average, a 42% increase in the total bacteria on the finger and a 15% increase in the total bacteria on the palm.
After washing hands, drying hands with paper towels, on average 76 per cent of the total bacteria on the finger and 77 per cent of the total bacteria on the hand, scientists have also conducted tests to determine whether various hands-on methods can cause cross-infection with other bathroom users and bathroom facilities.
It is alleged that the jet dry cell sprayed the air at 180 m/s (650 km/hour; 400 miles/hour) and was able to blow off microbes on the hands and on the aircraft, which could contaminate other bathroom users and bathroom facilities within 2 m.
Using a warm wind dryphone, microbes can spread to 0.25 meters outside the dryphone.
The results of the use of the tissue dryer show that there is no serious microbial transmission. In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess the different modes of dryer.
The following changes in bacteria were observed after the dry hands:
The study involved many different dryphone manufacturers, comparing these dryphones with paper towel hands.
During the trip, without soap and water, you can choose to wash your hands with hand disinfectant towels.
Alcohol free handwashing should have at least 60% alcohol.
Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis found in 1846 that hand washing was effective in preventing the spread of the disease in the hospital, but it was only a long time before medical personnel were forced to wash their hands.
Hospitals use electronic devices that provide feedback to alert hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
A study found that the use of these devices resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
Medical personnel wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, using full quantities of soap and water or gel to create foam and wash all parts of their hands.
Put your hands on each other's fingers.
If there's any residue between the nails, it can be removed with a hard brush.
Since the water left on hand may still be bacterial, it must be fully cleaned and dried with clean towels.
After drying, the tap should be closed with a paper towel (and, if necessary, with a paper towel to open the exit door).
This prevents the re-pollution of the hand by exposure to these surfaces.
In health institutions, the purpose of hand-washing is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ( "bacteria") and to avoid their spread.
Reports from the New England Medical Journal indicate that in most medical settings there are still cases where hand washing does not reach acceptable levels and a large number of health workers often forget to wash their hands before they come into contact with patients, leading to the spread of micro-organisms.
A study has shown that proper hand-washing, together with other simple procedures, can reduce blood circulation rates associated with catheters by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-washing methods in medical institutions.
The organization also posted a draft manual hygiene guide on its website for public comment.
Whitby et al. gave an overview.
If regulatory compliance is required, commercial equipment can be measured and validated by the counterparty.
The World Health Organization suggested "Five Minutes" to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluid
Before and after sterile operations.
After taking care of the patient, adding antibacterial chemicals to soap ( "soap" or "antibacterial soap") can result in handwashing.
This microbicide may be required before the operation is performed or in an environment with a large number of antibiotic resistant micro-organisms. In order to perform the operation, "clean" hands must have a faucet that can be opened and shut down without contact, hand-washing fluids with chlorine or iodine, sterile towels used to dry hands after washing hands, sterile brushes and other sterile tools to clean nails.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires hand-washing, forearms up to elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take long to wash (10 minutes).
When flushing, you must prevent the water from flowing back into your hands on your forearm.
After washing your hands, wipe your hands with sterile cloth and put on your operating clothes.
In order to reduce bacterial transmission, it is advisable to wash hands before and after contact with patients, or to use free bacterium washing fluid.
In order to control the disease in the hospital, it has been found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands comes from having a handwashing frequency of 20%, and having more than 35% of the hand cleaning frequency, further benefits are extremely limited.
Handwashing with ordinary soap has more than tripled the proportion of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to the use of antibacterial soap. After comparing hand-washing with the use of alcohol hand-washing with hand-washing with antibacterial soap (30 seconds each), the proportion of bacteria infected with alcohol hand-washing has been found to be 26% lower than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol handwashing interventions to reduce H1N1 influenza (HI1N1 influenza A) viruses and cosmopolitan spores. Improvements in the hand health of health institutions can be achieved by training staff on hand washing, increasing the supply of alcohol handwashing fluids and providing written and oral warnings to employees.
Further research is needed on which interventions are most effective in a variety of medical settings ...
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an important cost-effective tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people ' s homes, schools and workplaces presents a challenge to universal handwashing.
For example, in most rural African areas, it is rare to have a hand-washing tap in the vicinity of every private bathroom or public-health bathroom, even if there is a cheap way to build a hand-washing table.
However, the low frequency of hand-washing may also be the result of deep-rooted habits rather than the lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating the use of soap to wash hands can influence policy development, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioural changes among the population.
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing hand-washing rates in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing activities were less effective. An example of a school-based approach to hand-washing is the "tristar approach" promoted by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which encourages schools to adopt simple and affordable measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, the school can rise from one star to the highest of three.
Hand-washing outreach activities could include the construction of a hand-washing table to reduce disease and child mortality ...
Another example of hand-washing activities is World Hand-washing Day, which seeks to bring about behavioural change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronary virus epidemic, UNICEF promoted the use of a hand-washing emoticon.
Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing in developing countries and the avoidance of DALY.
However, reports indicate that it is more cost-effective to advocate hand-washing with soap than other water and sanitation interventions.
The first to recognize the importance of hand washing to human health — especially to those who are weak (e.g., mothers or wounded soldiers who have just given birth in hospitals) — were two pioneers in the field of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, a British founder of modern nursing.
At that time, most people still thought that the infection was caused by what was called the odour of venom.
The outbreak of food-borne diseases and medical infections in the 1980s prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be more active in promoting hand-health, emphasizing that hand-health is an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have increased awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap in order to protect people from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, a "right hand wash" poster will be displayed in public health rooms, in office buildings and in a washroom at the airport.
The expression "retired" means someone who says he doesn't want to be responsible for something, or he doesn't want to be involved in something.
It comes from the Bible Matthews, where Pontius Pilate washes his hands after deciding to crucify Jesus, and then turns into a wide-ranging practice in some English-speaking communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth began to make her wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, demonstrating that she felt guilty for her crimes and for encouraging her husband to commit a crime.
Research shows that people who think of or envisage immoral behaviour tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value handwashing facilities more often.
In addition, those who wash their hands after conceiving immoral behaviour are less likely to engage in other "purification" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religion demands hand washing for sanitary and symbolic purposes. A symbolic hand washing with water without soap is part of many religious symbols, including the Bahai faith, Hinduism, the tevilah in Judaism and the netilat yadayim baptism in Christianity, the baptism in Christianity and the baptism in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam demand washing hands after a toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require the washing of hands before and after meals.
COVID-19 Workplace Protection
COVID-19 Workplace protection is the prevention of coronary virus diseases using occupational safety and health measures to prevent and control hazards 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriateness of workplace risk prevention depends on the specific work site and task, and should be determined on the basis of risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and risk factors for potentially exposed individuals at COVID-19 ...
As required by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are the least occupationally exposed to the public and other colleagues, and it is therefore recommended that basic infection prevention measures be taken, including hand-washing, encouragement of family isolation after illness, respect for breathing protocol and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium exposure work includes work requiring regular or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected as a result of ongoing community transmission or international travel.
Including staff exposed to the general public, such as schools, high population density working environments and some large retail environments.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the group should be ventilated using high-efficiency air filters and sneeze protections, wearing personal protective equipment and other hazardous precautions when exposed to COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers that there is a high risk of exposure to medical personnel and ward staff who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients, and that exposure becomes extremely high if staff members perform aerosol-producing operations on known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collect or process specimens from them.
The risk-control measures applicable to such persons include engineering controls, such as impregnated ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their tasks ...
COVID-19 outbreak could have serious implications in the workplace.
Staff members may be absent due to illness, need for care or fear of exposure.
Business models may also change, including changes in demand for or access to commodities (e.g., shopping at non-peak hours, or use of distribution or off-duty delivery services).
Finally, the flow of products from the COVID-19 outbreak area may be disrupted.
These plans address risk levels associated with a variety of workplace and work tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from family and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers, such as older persons or groups with chronic diseases.
The plans also outline the precautions needed to address these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Infectious disease prevention and response plans may need to be subject to national or local advice.
Targets for responding to outbreaks include reducing staff-to-staff transmission, protecting populations at higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the response will be influenced by the severity of the disease in the enterprise ' s community.
The hazard control level is the widely used control framework in occupational safety and health and is used to group hazard control measures according to their effectiveness.
If the COVID-19 hazard cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering control means separating employees from work-related hazards, rather than relying on staff behaviour to control them, which is the least costly solution to implement ...
Administrative control means a change in work policies or procedures requiring the staff member or the employer to act on their own initiative ...
Personal protective equipment (PPE) has less control than engineering and administrative controls, but helps to prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the level of hazard to which the staff member is exposed, equipped as applicable (e.g. respirators) and must always be properly worn, periodically inspected and maintained, and replaced as necessary, properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have the least occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended that all workplaces adopt basic infection prevention measures, including hand-washing, residential isolation of sick workers, respiration when coughing or sneezing, provision of paper towels and garbage cans, preparation for teleworking and, if necessary, wrong peaks to get off work, discouraging employees from using other people ' s tools and equipment, and maintaining daily cleaning and disinfection in the workplace.
The timely identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is key to protecting workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who exhibit acute respiratory symptoms should be kept in isolation at home for at least 24 hours, until it is determined that there is no fever, heat signs or any other symptoms, and that sick leave policies should be implemented flexibly, allowing employees to take care of sick family members at home, and that employees should be clearly informed of the policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure includes work that requires frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within 6 feet (1.8 m), but may cause an individual to become infected with SARS-COV-2 as a result of continuous community transmission in the vicinity of the workplace or as a result of a recent possible COVID-19 outbreak.
This category of staff includes staff employed in schools, high-density work environments and some high-risk groups exposed to the general public. Engineering controls for this group and high-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, improved ventilation, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneeze protection devices and the installation of off-duty windows to provide customer services. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk group include encouraging isolation of sick workers, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing faulty shifts, eliminating non-essential travel to the COVID-19 outbreak sites, developing emergency communication plans, including a forum to answer staff questions, providing staff with updated education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviour, training staff in the use of protective clothing and protective equipment, providing protective clothing and protective equipment to staff in need of protective clothing and equipment, providing resources and work environments that contribute to improving personal health, requiring hands-washing, limiting the entry of customers and the public to the workplace, posting logos on hand-washing and other protective measures.
It's best for this type of staff to have a respirator.
In the event of illness on board the aircraft, appropriate protective measures should be taken to protect the staff and other passengers, including placing the patient at a distance of 6 feet from other passengers, assigning a crew member to serve the patient, providing the patient with a mask or requiring the patient to cover his nose and mouth with a tissue during cough or sneezing.
The crew shall wear one-time medical gloves when caring for sick travellers, touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces.
For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazardous precautions also include delaying travel in case of illness. If heat or other symptoms occur on board, self-segregation should be provided and the medical room on board should be immediately notified.
Ideally, medical follow-up visits should be carried out in the compartments of the isolated ... For schools and childcare facilities, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control recommend the short-term closure of schools and childcare facilities for thorough cleaning or disinfection if the infected person has been in school, regardless of the spread of the community.
For medium- and low-level community communication, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of field trips, meetings and sports classes, choirs or other large gatherings such as cafeteria meals, increased distance between desks, peaks and departures, restricted non-essential visitors, and separate health offices for children with influenza symptoms.
In the event of severe community transmission, in addition to the social distance strategy, consideration may be given to extending the suspension period.... For law enforcement personnel performing routine routine activities, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control consider that they face a lower direct health risk.
It is recommended that law enforcement personnel who must have access to COVID-19 who are diagnosed or suspected of being individuals act at the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including with appropriate personal protective equipment ...
In the event of close contact during the arrest, the staff member should clean and disinfect his or her line of duty belts and equipment before using a household cleaning spray or rag before using it, and should comply with standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures, as well as clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.
OSHA considers certain health care and morgue staff to be at high or very high risk of exposure.
Staff at high risk include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff for physical contact with known or suspected people infected with COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes extremely high when staff implement foam generation procedures for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collect or process specimens of infected or suspected infected persons.
The foam generation process includes tube intubation, cough induction, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or body cavity sample collection.
High exposure mortuary staff include staff involved in the sorting of the bodies of the deceased, who were diagnosed or suspected cases by COVID-19, and who would be at higher risk of exposure if an autopsy was carried out. Additional engineering measures for this risk group include isolation rooms for COVID-19 identified or suspected cases, including in the implementation of the foam generation process.
Some health-care facilities and morgues could also be equipped with a specialized system of negative ventilation.
Biosecurity level 3 precautions should be taken when handling specimens.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends different waiting areas for patients depending on whether they are suspected to be COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Authority also recommends that persons working within 6 feet of patients known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as persons carrying out foam generation procedures be required to wear respirators.
The U.S. requires the use of N95 filter masks or better masks, approved by NIOSH, in a fully documented respiratory protection environment such as health testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and staff comfort. WHO does not recommend protective clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
WHO recommends that the screening officers at the points of entry wear only a medical surgical mask.
WHO recommends medical surgical masks, goggles or masks, robes and gloves for staff who need to take respiratory samples from the COVID-19 patient and provide care or transfer services to the patient without having to perform the foam generation process.
If you want to do the foam generation program, you have to replace the surgical mask with a N95 or FFP2.
In view of the inadequate supply of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends reducing the demand for personal protective equipment through such measures as telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only direct care personnel to enter the rooms of patients with COVID-19, only when there is a genuine need for personal protective equipment for specific missions, continuing to use the same breathing apparatus for the care of patients with multiple identical diagnostic findings, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment and discouraging the use of masks by non-symptomatic personnel.

Theme: [Covid-19] Lightly mounted to prepare for the future
Date/time of dispatch: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licence: CC0: No rights reserved
We've had some tough times since this month.
In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we have clearly felt the fate of all mankind, while recognizing our responsibility to each other.
We are faced with unprecedented challenges, but we are well aware that the best response to such challenges requires a sense of solidarity, cooperation and community-building around the world, which is the core philosophy of Wikimedia.
The transmission of friendship and love through e-mails, telephone calls and chats between all colleagues is a good proof of the extraordinaryness of our colleagues, and how fortunate we are to work with you.
I'm so grateful and proud to be a colleague with you.
Last week, someone paid tribute to our work.
They made me realize how meaningful it is to have Wikipedia in the world at this point in time, and the symbolic power that this vital resource has brought to people around the world to keep it running.
Wikimedia's work is not without your hard work, whether it's your job to run the website, pay for it or community safety.
The world now needs more information than ever before from Wikipedia.
At this stage, the content and even the way we work will have an important impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities that our colleagues carry, we will make some important adjustments to our collaborative approach starting next week.
Adjustments to the working methods and timetable
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the senior management team met last night to discuss the way the company works and the timetable for the next few days and months.
At the meeting, we considered what we consider to be appropriate responses to the current challenges facing companies and best practices to ensure that companies maintain sustainable development during the epidemic.
The senior management team agreed to ease pressure on the company's employees so that they can support the company's mission for a long time.
We support your efforts to ease the pressure.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours a day (or 20 hours a week) and any subsequent changes will be notified further.
If you can work longer every day, we'll assign you a job based on the length of your work.
However, given the unpredictability of the current world situation, we will give priority to your personal needs, such as caring for your family, shopping or medical consultations.
We won't follow your hours.
If you're sick, please drop your job.
It's self-evident, but we'd like to remind you, please.
You do not need to take sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team revise the work calendar and timetable to ensure that key areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan of Talent and Cultural Operations, which will provide you with support and ensure that your situation is properly followed by management.)
For an hourly employee, we'll pay in full.
We have already expressed our commitment and renewed our commitment to honour the commitments made to the contractor and our hourly colleagues.
The salary we pay to all will continue to be calculated on the basis of their remuneration for normal working hours under normal conditions.
Even if you're sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through their work and release their pressure.
Our work can bring incredible rewards, especially in times like this.
But taking care of yourself is still first.
We ask you to keep in touch with the manager so that we can keep abreast of your developments and adjust them accordingly.
Prioritize important work.
We have to keep some important jobs running.
The work of website reliability engineering teams, human resources operations teams, trust and security teams and fund-raising teams (and others) is critical and may require additional support.
We will begin to assess current goals with all sectors and shift our focus to supporting matters that are critical to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus on the most important projects.
A temporary slowdown will not affect future developments.
We're not going to work overtime after the epidemic.
We're not asking you to work overtime to catch up, because it doesn't seem practical right now.
We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new targets and timetables as appropriate.
What's going to happen to the APP?
In order to adapt to the new realities and daily working hours requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 plan.
We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time to set the budget so that staff members can prioritize key tasks and take care of themselves and their families; and at the same time, to adjust the working arrangements for those staff members who need or wish to reduce their workload in the coming weeks.
Extension of the schedule would significantly reduce the current planned workload and work pressure across the Organization.
We will present the above proposal to the Board next week. If the proposal is adopted, we will update the working arrangements for follow-up to delegates and teams as soon as possible.
Thank you for the APP team's leadership in this process.
Office conditions, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a colleague from San Francisco's office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But, in the interest of caution, we hired some antiviral cleaners to clean the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-level disinfection solutions to disinfect surfaces and the halls and elevators that lead to our floors.
The office building is fulfilling its duty of care agreement to use the corresponding products to secure the tenants.
We believe that when you decide to return to work, the office is well prepared to meet you.
Our Washington, D.C. office uses WeWork's office, Wework shares COVID-19 agreements with us and with all Washington, D.C. staff.
As of last week, the Washington, D.C. office has moved to full teleworking, in accordance with the guidance we shared with the San Francisco office.
At the same time, as some New York office colleagues already know, we have been discussing the issue of renting office space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are continuing, but they may be postponed.
For the first time, some of our colleagues were in contact with teleworking.
Other colleagues who have been working remotely for long periods of time would like to offer them some suggestions for adjusting their working methods:
Meeting time should be kept within one or two hours.
If more time is needed, consider spreading the meeting to multiple dates.
Conference objectives are clearly defined, agenda is set and reading materials are sent in advance.
Videoconferencing as a default mode of meetings, with online collaboration and contacts using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For each meeting, one presiding officer is assigned to monitor questions in the chat window and to follow changes in the list of speakers, and another person is assigned to assist with the minutes (or in a multi-person collaborative manner).
If you need comfortable headphones, send an e-mail to the technical support department.
Use your health allowance to buy snacks.
Join the #remotiers channel on the Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues
The Human Resources Operations Team is studying anthropo-engineering guidance in the form of webinars to help all of its colleagues work more efficiently during distributed office hours.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia before the announcement of the outbreak.
These and other restrictions on the removal of activities may result in the communities' recipients not being able to carry out their intended contribution activities, and we have informed them that we understand this, while pledging that no one of them will be punished for postponing or modifying these objectives.
Over the next week, we will continue to provide more guidance at the Wikimania and other regional community meetings and thematic community meetings.
The global community now seems to be in mourning over the devastation caused by the epidemic, but it also reflects the relief of being able to keep a clear eye on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT team will create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide the community with a space to monitor impacts and track community and our interactions.
Contact and communication on COVID-19-related issues
We're planning a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00, and we'll send an invitation to your calendar later.
At the meeting, we'll share some updates, answer your questions and set aside some time for discussion.
We are here to help you with our unity.
At the same time, you can find more information from this e-mail and other important information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
The CRT team will update these pages in a timely manner and centralize all the information in one place.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries/areas currently severely affected by the epidemic.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, major work processes or insurance, or need other assistance, please contact and cooperate with the CRT team at any time.

Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2, ACE2 is an enzyme attached to the outside (cell membrane) surface of cells in lungs, arteries, hearts, kidneys and intestinal tracts.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of the associated Angiotensin-converting Enzyme, ACE by reducing the concentration of vascular stressor II and increasing the concentration of Ang (1-7) and is expected to be a drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 is also the entry point for certain coronal viruses into cells.
The source version of this enzyme is commonly known as hACE2.
An vascular tension transformation enzyme 2 is a zinc metal enzyme located on the surface of inner skin cells and other cells.
ACE2 contains a N-end enzyme M2 structural domain and a C-end Collactrin renal amino acid trans-shipment protein structural domain.
ACE2 is a monolithic I membrane protein whose enzyme active structure is exposed to the cytological surfaces of the lungs and other organisations.
Another enzyme known as the drop-down enzyme (sheddase) cracks the extra-cell structure of ACE2 from the membrane structure area, produces soluble proteins that are released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cellular membranes, mainly lung-type II pulmonary bubble cells, intestinal episothelic cells in the small intestines, artery and veins in most organs, as well as arterial smoothing muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in the cortex of the brain, in the texture, in the hypothalamus and in the brain stem.
ACE2's main function is to counterbalance ACE.
ACE decomposition of vascular stressors I cracks into vascular stressors with vascular condensation.
ACE2 Cracked angiogenesis II (Asp-ARG-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) phenylamino acid at the end of the cylindrium and dehydrated to vascular stress (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 also cracks many other beryllium species, including depreciated amino acid 9, apelin, neuropressurin, morphine a and stomach hunger.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of neutral amino acid trans-shipment protein SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnup.
As a transfilm protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronary viruses into cells, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (a virus leading to SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (a virus leading to COVID-19).
More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 S1 stinged proteins are combined with the enzyme structure of ACE2 on the surface of the cell, leading to internal ingestion and the co-location of viruses and enzymes into the inside of the cell.
This entry process also requires the host's THMPSS2 to trigger the activation of S protein, and is currently studying whether inhibition of the process can be a potential cure. Some speculate that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help to combat infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators have recommended the continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic evaluation and analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group".
And, "for patients at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with mid-career and heart failure, the use of ACE inhibitors also reduces the risk of pneumonia.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also related to reduced pneumonia-related mortality, but results are less reliable than reducing the overall pneumonia risk ... "
Reconstructor ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new method of treating acute lung damage, which appears to improve pulmonary flow mechanics indicators and haematological saturation in pigs due to lipid-smelt-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in the human body is about 10 hours, the active time is 30 minutes, and the active time (extends) is 24 hours.
According to some studies, rhaCE2 may be a promising drug for patients who are resistant to inhibition or diseases with elevated vascular stress levels in the classic renal-angiotensin system (renin-angiotensin system, RAS). rhaCE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the efficacy of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronary virus outbreak, to help track people in close contact and identify individuals who may have been in contact with the infection (`the contacts').
Many applications have been developed or proposed by some regions and jurisdictions with the support of official governments.
Many of the frameworks used to build close contact tracking applications have been established.
The issue of privacy has also attracted many attention, especially in the case of systems that need to track the geographical location of application users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of bluetooth signals to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
On April 10th, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate these functions in support of Bluetooth applications directly into Andrea and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government has jointly developed an application to support citizens in self-inspecting access to COVID-19 patients.
The program is now in use in over 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an application called TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community as an open source software and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia launched a Bluetooth-based application, "StopKorona!" to track exposure to potential infections and help medical institutions respond quickly.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication Technology and the Ministry of Health of Northern Macedonia.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the Government announced that the Close Contact Tracker application was at an advanced stage of development and would be operational in the coming weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar application ( "StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering developing a similar application based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geographical fence application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering at Cambridge University, cited a number of practical problems that might exist with the application system, including false positive misreporting and the possibility that the application might be ineffective if used by only a small fraction of the population.
In order to prevent the spread of misleading or harmful coronary virus applications, apples impose restrictions on the type of organization that can post a coronary virus-related application in Apple Application Shop, i.e. only "official" or other reputable organization.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders claim to be concerned about large-scale surveillance using coronary virus applications, especially as to whether the control infrastructure built in response to the coronary virus epidemic should be dismantled after the threat of the epidemic has been eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
These organizations have announced eight conditions to be met by government projects:
Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
The monitoring and surveillance extension must have a sunset clause;
The data collected are limited to COVID-19 purposes only;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there is evidence of effective protection;
Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
Any data-sharing with third parties should be defined by law;
It is important to provide safeguards against data misuse and to provide citizens with the right to respond to data abuse;
All relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalized groups, are required to participate.... The German Combination Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also issued verification lists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address ongoing surveillance and remove it from the equipment operating system as soon as tracking is no longer required.
Some countries have adopted web-based rather than application-based location tracking, without users having to download applications and avoiding being tracked.
In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
A web-based solution with access to raw location data may have serious privacy problems.
However, not all systems with their own central servers have access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that use central servers only to communicate with each other have been created (see below for more details).
Korea has introduced a system that is not based on applications to perform contact tracking missions.
Instead of using specific applications, the system chooses to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combines that information with text messages to inform potential infected persons.
In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the Government has been allowed to disclose location information because of the significant changes made to the information privacy laws in the country following the MERS outbreak.
The public has access to this information through many applications and websites... and some countries (including Germany) are considering using both centralized systems and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, no specific details had been published.
Privacy protection close contact tracking is a recognized concept, with a large amount of relevant research dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than 10 expert groups were working on privacy protection solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth low-capacity (BLE) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
PEP-PT is a coordinated programme with a centralized and decentralized approach, not a single agreement. Dispersion agreements include decentralized proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly called contact event number CEN), privacy sensitive protocols and mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT).
Under these protocols, identifiable personal data will never leave the device, and all matches will be made on the device.
The privacy team at the MIT Media Laboratory has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or path-crossing data to track COVID-19.
The platform is based on the development of a white paper entitled "Applicationlessness: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. In addition to this, Enigma MPC, a company originally created at the MIT Media Laboratory and dedicated to developing privacy technologies, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace uses security hardware technology to support users in sharing sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, a number of groups joined together to form the Global TCN Alliance around essentially the same methodology and fundamentally overlapping agreements, with the goal of reducing fragmentation information and supporting global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, which is a key to achieving widespread application.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that its official government application uses the BlueTrace protocol.
On April 10th, 2020, Google and Apple, respectively, controlling the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a close contact tracking program, claiming that the program combines bluetooth low-energy technology with privacy protection encryption technology to protect privacy.
In addition, they published the core technical specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be launched in three phases:
Launching of tools to support the Government in creating an official, privacy-protected coronary virus tracking application
To integrate this function directly into iOS and Andreau systems, Google and Apple plans to launch the system first through the upgrade of the operating system, and to remove the system in the same way after the outbreak threat, thereby addressing the issue of follow-up surveillance.
b Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, re-evaluation, redistribution or treatment conversion) means the conversion of an approved drug to other uses for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific route currently being developed to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusions during the recovery period. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be used in pharmaceuticals, with multiple formulations at a bit.

Virus vector (I stage developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics,5 gland virus vector)
In April, CEPI scientists reported that a total of 115 candidate vaccines were in the early stages of development, 78 of which had been identified as ongoing projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and 37 of which had been announced but had little public information (presumably being planned or designed).
Initial safety and immunogenity tests, usually random, multi-point tests against placebos, are conducted during the I-II period, while a more precise and effective dose is determined.
III Tests usually involve a larger number of participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of vaccines against disease while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose ...

Further random trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health personnel.
The vaccine under development may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies using COVID-19 specific animal models, such as ACE2 genetically modified mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates to assess vaccine efficacy indicate the need for biosafety level 3 containment measures to deal with live viruses and international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines for SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.

Social media articles fuel conspiracy theories, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and that vaccines are available.
The patents cited in various social media articles refer to other existing patents for toxic genetic sequences and vaccines of coronary viruses (e.g. SARS coronary viruses).
2019 Coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include heat, cough and agitation.
Other symptoms may include weakness, muscular acidity, diarrhoea, ingesting pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The period of incubation from exposure to the patient to the onset of the disease varies from 2 to 14 days, usually about 5 days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, the total number of reported cases in 210 countries and territories worldwide exceeded 2.24 million, with over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people are currently recovering from treatment. The virus spreads between people mainly through close contact, often by coughing, sneezing or talking about foam.
Although the exhale produces foam, it usually falls on the ground or on the surface of various objects and does not cause long-range transmission.
In addition, if someone touches the contaminated surface and then touches his nose or his nose, he may be infected with the virus.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours on the surface of the object.
Although the first three days before the onset of the disease and the later stages of recovery can also spread, it is the most contagious. The standard diagnostic method is a real-time reductive reaction (rRT-PCR) of nasal swaths.
It is recommended that those suspected to be infected with the virus and their caregivers wear masks.
The recommendations concerning the wearing of masks by the public vary from one authority to another to another, with some authorities opposing the wearing of masks and others demanding the wearing of masks.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine or special antiviral therapy programme.
Most of the countries in all six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus may be symptoms-free, or they may have suspected influenza symptoms, such as fever, cough, lack of strength and agitation.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory difficulties, persistent chest pain or discomfort, blurry consciousness, difficulty in awakening and bruises on the face or lips; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended.
A few cases may be associated with respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, snorting or throat pain.
Different proportions of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, are also monitored.
Some of the cases in China started with symptoms of chest depression and heart palpitation.
Some cases can develop into viral pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even death.
We call it a lurch period.
COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may be extended to 2-14 days.
97.5% of infected persons have symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The report states that not all infected persons have symptoms.
The role of people with no symptoms in the spread of the epidemic is not yet fully clear; however, there is prima facie evidence that people with no symptoms may contribute to the spread of the disease ...
The proportion of people infected without symptoms has not yet been determined and research is still being intensified. The Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of the cases diagnosed do not show any symptoms during hospitalization.
Since April 1, China's National Board of Health and Health has included symptoms-free cases in its daily bulletin; of the 166 cases infected on that date, 130 (78 per cent) were without symptoms at the time of testing.
Both saliva and saliva carry a lot of viruses.
Speak loudly and spit more than a normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that an unshielded cough can lead to the widest spread of foam by 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this type of virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has determined that it could be transmitted by bioaerosol, and the air collectors outside the ward detected a positive sample of the virus RNA.
Medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, may mistify respiratory genres, causing air transport.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through faeces, but the risk is considered to be low. The virus is the most contagious when the patient has symptoms; although it may be transmitted before it occurs, the risk is lower.
According to the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC), although the transmission of the new coronary virus is not yet entirely clear, it is common for 1 person to transmit 2-3 persons. The duration of the virus's life on the surface of the object varies from hours to days.
Specifically, the new crown virus is known to survive one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastics (polypropane) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours on 99% pure copper.
However, its survival time is also influenced by humidity and temperature.
If used correctly, soap and detergents can also be used to kill viruses. The fat-protective layer of the soap product degradable viruses renders them inactivated while removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as phenolamine and glucated glucate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China, shows that saliva samples were taken on average two days after admission.
5/6 patients had the highest viral load in their first sample and 1/6 patients had the highest viral load detected the next day.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus that was first isolated from three pneumonia patients in a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the natural coronary virus.
Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with household soap, which can destroy the virus ' s protective cyst. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus is converted to the host cell through angiogenesis 2 (ACE2), which has the highest concentration in lung type II pulmonary bubble cells.
The virus is combined with ACE2 and enters host cells through a special surface glucose protein called "Stumps".
12% of patients admitted to Wuhan Hospital in China found acute myocardial damage, with a high rate of severe diseases.
As a result of the deterioration of the pathology, the overall inflammation and immune system disorders are associated with a high incidence of cardiovascular symptoms, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to the ACE2 receptor of the heart.
ACE2 Receptor expresses high in the heart and is involved in regulating the function of the heart.
According to the information received, there is a high incidence of cavity (31%) of infected persons (31%) and lymphobic embolism (25%) under the supervision of the ICU, which may be related to pre- and post-mortem. COVID-19 fatal patient autopsy found permissible pulmonary bubble damage (DAD) and lymphocytitis in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is addictive to respiratory skin cells that express ACE2, COVID-19 has a general hyperinflammation response.
In particular, the pathologicality of the CM-CSF in the patients of COVID-19 is associated with the inflammation of IL-6 mononucleocytes and severe pulmonary pathology.
The autopsy report also saw lymphocytes immersed.
WHO has published several disease detection programs.
The standard test method is a real-time reversal of the polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually used to test respiratory samples obtained through a swab; however, a swab or sap sample can also be used.
As a rule, the results can be obtained in a few hours to two days.
A blood test can also be performed, but the two blood samples required a two-week interval, with little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate the coronary strain of the virus and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop the PCR to detect reagents and thus detect infection with the virus.
As of April 4th, 2020, antibody testing (not only active infections, but also individuals who have been infected with the virus) was still under development, but has not yet been extended.
According to Chinese experience, the accuracy of the tests is only 60 to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the United States FDA approved its first instant diagnostic reagent, which became operational at the end of the month.
Early infections are more visible in double-pulmonary foliage glass, with asymmetrical and rear parts.
As the virus develops, there may be subpleural palsy, gravel signs (severally thicker leaves with pulmonary bubbles) and pulmonary changes.
Little information is available on COVID-19 micropathological injuries and pathologies.
The main pathological findings of the post-mortem examination were as follows:
Eye examination: pleuralitis, CPR, pneumoconiosis and pulmonary oedema
Four acute levels of viral pneumonia were observed:
Light pneumonia: oedema, growth of pulmonary cells, large numbers of atypical pulmonary cells, leaching of lymphocytes with Isophthetic Inflammation and formation of polynuclear megacells
Severe pneumonia: Permissive pneumoconiosis (DAD) with permeable pneumoconiosis.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe hypoxiaemia.
Pneumonia in the recovery phase: leaching fluids from the pneumocular cavity and inter-pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: Condensed blood in dispersive veins (DIC); infant white-child red-cell reaction
Preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection include: staying at home; avoiding access to densely populated areas; washing hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends covering mouths and noses with paper towels when coughing or sneezing; if there is no paper towel, using the inside side of the elbow.
It is recommended that the hand be properly cleaned after coughing or sneezing.
CDC recommends wearing a mask in public to prevent, to some extent, the transmission of the virus by patients with no symptoms. The focus of the social distance strategy is to close schools and workplaces, limit travel and cancel large public gatherings, thereby reducing access to large-scale groups of infected persons.
In addition, the social distance rule requires a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) in interpersonal relationships.
Given that it is expected that the vaccine will not be developed until at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, which is what we know is the "spread epidemiology curve".
At the same time, the CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds, especially before meals and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing when there's a clear stain behind the toilet or on their hands.
In addition, it is recommended to wash hands with at least 60% alcohol, but only when there is no soap or running water around them. In areas where water-free hand-washing cannot be purchased, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropanol.
Use hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacterium spores from alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not a "hand disinfectant."
Add glycerine as a moisturizer.
Supportive care for people, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support and other critical organs affected ...
CDC recommends that those suspected to be carrying the virus wear a simple mask.
An ECMO has been used to mitigate respiratory failure, but its benefits remain to be studied.
It is recommended that personal hygiene be maintained and healthy lifestyles and eating habits be promoted in order to increase immunity ...
Supportive therapy may be effective for people with early mild illness. WHO and the China National Health Board launched an initiative calling for proper care for COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.
U.S. experts in critical pathology and lungs have compiled a collection of treatment proposals from various institutions and made them available free of charge through IBCC.
As of April 2020, no COVID-19 special effects therapy had been developed.
For some symptoms, some medical experts suggest accelerosis instead of abdominophenol as a first-line treatment for Broven.
Precautionary measures must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus and to complete operations that may produce aerosols in a medical environment, such as intubation or hand-to-hand air conditioning, with particular attention to protection ...
With regard to medical personnel caring for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends that, in addition to standard preventive measures, exposure and air-transmission prevention measures, patients should be transferred to the air-borne infectious disease isolation cell (AIIR). CTC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during an epidemic.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 Masks have been approved for use in industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized the use of such masks under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
It is primarily used to prevent inhalation of suspended particles (e.g. dust) but is not used for other purposes to ensure effective isolation of specific biological agents.
Without the mask, the CDC suggests using the mask and wearing a homemade mask if necessary.
Most COVID-19 cases are less symptomatic and do not require mechanical ventilation or other options, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.
Medical personnel are actively conducting research to provide breathing support to COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure symptoms. There is evidence that via nose high flow oxygen therapy or two-phase gas pneumatics can avoid intubation.
It is not clear whether these two treatments will have the same effect on patients with severe illnesses.
If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use artificially ingested gas, because this technique also limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow oxygen therapy. Cases of serious illness are dominated by older persons (60 years of age and above, in particular 80 years of age).
The number of beds per capita is insufficient in many developed countries, and the health system is unable to cope with the critical situation of admission to hospitals due to the surge in the number of cases of COVID-19.
A study in China found that 5 per cent of patients need to be sent to intensive care, 2.3 per cent need mechanical ventilation, and 1.4 per cent will die as a result.
About 30% of COVID-19 patients in China were eventually admitted to ICU.
With the development of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) triggered by COVID-19, the complexity of mechanical ventilation has increased, and oxygen is becoming more difficult.
Respirators that support pressure control patterns and high PEEPs are then required to maximize the delivery of oxygen while minimizing the risk of lung damage and aerobic breast damage from the respirator.
The old respirator might not be able to reach high.
Since January 2020, a number of antiviral drugs have been introduced into clinical trials.
Red Seaway seems to be one of the most promising drugs at this time.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several of the drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or are in advanced stages of testing.
People with serious illnesses can try to use antivirals.
WFP calls on volunteers to participate in potential therapeutic effectiveness and safety trials. FDA has temporarily authorized the restoration of plasma transfusion as experimental treatment for persons with severe life-threatening conditions.
No clinical research has yet been undertaken to demonstrate whether the treatment is safe and effective in treating the disease.
In February 2020, China released a mobile application to contain outbreaks.
Users are required to enter names and ID numbers as required.
This application allows for the detection of "close contact" by monitoring data, thus determining the risk of potential infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
Once potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends self-segregation, but also alerts local health officials.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government authorized security agencies to track cell phone data of suspected coronary virus carriers.
This measure was taken with a view to imposing isolation and protecting groups that might be in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, German telecommunications shared aggregate cell phone location data with the Robert Koh Institute of the German Federal Government in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect persons violating quarantine regulations.
According to Giulio Gallera, the Italian Regional Health Commissioner, mobile phone operators, "40% of the citizens are still moving around."
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hack marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronary virus on a global scale.
Segregation, travel restrictions, treatment of side effects or fear of self-inflicted infection can all be troubling.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connell, "Social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic depression are perfect storms that harm people ' s mental health and well-being. "
The disease is mild, with little or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds.
Light cases can normally be recovered within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take between three and six weeks to recover.
According to data from other similar viruses (e.g. SARS and MERS), pregnant women are at higher risk of developing into seriously ill patients with COVID-19, but lacked COVID-19 data support. COVID-19 may have an impact on the lungs of some people, causing pneumonia.
In the worst affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, sepsis or multi-organ function failure.
COVID-19 Related complications include sepsis, condensation abnormalities, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
6% of COVID-19 admissions have condensed blood abnormalities, especially prolonged enzymes, while 4% of the group have kidney abnormalities.
About 20-30% COVID-19 patients have increased liver enzymes.
According to the same report, the average time between onset and death was 10 days, of which the average time spent in hospital was 5 days.
But the average time between hospital admission and death for patients who have been transferred to ICU is seven days.
Early case studies found that the average time between early symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total time range of 6 to 41.
A study by the National Commission on Health and Health (NHC) of China found that the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
Anatomical pulmonary sample tissue pathological examination shows that both lungs have mucous glucose glucose samples of the pulmonary pneumococular lesions.
Pulmonary cells observe viral cell pathologies.
Lung images are similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
11.8% of deaths reported by the China National Board of Health and Health caused heart damage due to increased calcium protein levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data released in the United States in March, 89 per cent of admissions have a history of past illness. The availability of medical resources and regional socio-economic conditions may also affect mortality rates.
In view of regional differences and methodological difficulties, estimates of disease mortality vary.
Underestimating cases of light disease can lead to overestimation of mortality.
However, if a case dies as a result of a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
In comparison to non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to become COVID-19 seriously ill and 2.4 times more likely to be in need of intensive care or to die.... People are concerned about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority of China found that the lung activity of some of the recovered persons decreased by 20 to 30 per cent, and lung scans showed organ damage.
In addition, recovery may expose him to post-care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it is not certain that the pre-existing infection will provide effective long-lasting immunization for the recovered.
The behaviour characteristics of other coronary viruses have been identified as potentially immune, but some of the COVID-19 cases have been reported to be tested positive for coronary virus shortly after recovery.
These cases are thought to be worsening infections rather than re-infecting.
The virus is considered a natural virus that originates in animals and is infected through spills.
The actual origin has not yet been determined, but as of December 2019, the infection was almost entirely interpersonal.
The first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published by the Lancet in January 2020, showed that the earliest date of the outbreak was December 1st, 2019.
The earliest date reported in the WHO official publication is December 8th, 2019.
There are a number of methods used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region, changing over time, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the quantity tested, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the onset of the first outbreak and age, gender and overall health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 Emergency Disease Code U07.1 to laboratory confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections and U07.2 to clinical or epidemiological diagnosed infections COVID-19 but not confirmed by laboratory. Death rate equals the total number of deaths within the given time frame divided by the total number of confirmed cases.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as at 17 April 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.9 per cent (153,822/2, 240, 191).
Other measures include case mortality (CFR) as a percentage of confirmed deaths and infection mortality (IFR) as a percentage of confirmed deaths, while the latter as a percentage of infected deaths (both confirmed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-limited and follow the entire process from infection to case resolution for specific populations.
Although not all infected persons produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies provides information on the number of infected persons.
The Italian Epidemic Center Castiglione d'Adda, a small town with only 4,600 inhabitants, has 80 people (1.7 per cent) killed by the epidemic.
In Gangelt, the epidemic spreads through various carnivals, affecting even young people, but mortality rates are relatively low, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.
In addition, the German medical system is overburdened.
According to the blood donor's assessment, about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.
So far, 69 people (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate vary according to sex.
Studies in China and Italy show that men have higher mortality rates than women.
Men aged 50-60 are at the highest risk of death, with only a close gender gap in the 90-year age group.
The mortality rate in China is 2.8 per cent for males and 1.7 per cent for females.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are not yet clear, but may be due to genetic and behavioural factors ...
Gender-based immunological differences, lower smoking rates among women and lower age of men with complications (e.g. hypertension) have led to higher mortality rates among men than among women.
In Europe, 57 per cent of men are infected, and 72 per cent of all deaths due to COVID-19 are attributed to men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government had yet to track sex-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher, as is the probability of exposure to the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease "COVID-19".
The director of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained this: CO for "cap" and VI for "virus" and D for "disease" and 19 for the first outbreak of the epidemic (31 December 2019).
The name was chosen to avoid citing specific geographic locations (e.g. China), animal species or populations, in line with international naming recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that triggered COVID-19 was called the Severe Acute Respiratory Coronary Virus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Besides, WHO uses "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus that triggers COVID-19."
Disease and virus are commonly known as the "capacitor virus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "cronary virus" and "cronary virus" in Wuhan.
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary viruses and disease names based on the 2015 guidelines on the use of location in disease and virus names.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2.
Given the capacity limitations of the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers began printing health-care materials such as swabs and respirators.
For example, an Italian hospital is in dire need of ventilation valves, suppliers are unable to deliver components within the required time frame, a local start-up company carries out reverse engineering work, printing 100 ventilation valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, misinformation and false information spread rapidly through the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
There's no evidence of replicating the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.
Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively engaged in international research and the development of vaccines and drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the Solidarity Experiment to assess the efficacy of the treatment of the four existing antiviral compounds that are currently most likely to produce therapeutic effects.
There is no vaccine yet, but there is active development of candidate vaccines at all levels.
As SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both enter human cells via ACE2 receptors, the results of previous SARS-CoV work need to be used.
People are working on three vaccine strategies.
First, researchers are planning to develop a whole virus vaccine.
Using such viruses, whether inert or lethal, is intended to provoke rapid immune responses to humans during new infections of COVID-19.
The second strategy is to develop sub-unit vaccines, designed to develop a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to react sensitively to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, such research focused on supporting virus intrusion into the ACE2 enzyme receptor ' s s stabbing protein.
The third strategy is to develop a nucleic acid vaccine.
The safety and effectiveness of these strategies must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched the first clinical trial of the vaccine.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic sequences from the replicating of the virus that causes the disease. It has been argued that the increased dependence of antibodies can be a major challenge in the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
By April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials had been conducted.
Seven trials were completed and approved for treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The conversion of antivirals to use is the vast majority of research in China, and nine clinical trials will be conducted in several countries by the end of April for the third phase of Redshewet.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and candidate drugs has been initiated. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently being assessed, including redcive, chlorptunium and hydroxylene, lopnave/Litonave and lopinave/Litonavee combination interference with beta.
As of March 2020, the efficacy of Redsheve had been initially confirmed.
It was observed that the clinical symptoms of patients treated with compassionate drugs in Redhwee had abated.
At this stage, in the United States, China and Italy, clinical trials are under way for phase III. In February 2020, China launched a study on chlorptunium (which was used in the past to treat malaria) and obtained preliminary results.
However, there was a call for peer review of the study.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities have recommended the use of chloroquine.
But the Wuhan virology institute recommends 1 gram a day, with a reminder that twice the dose is dangerous and possibly fatal.
On March 28th, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for chloroxin and hydroxyl chloride, but the doctor has the right to decide whether to use the two drugs for treatment of patients with COVID-19. China’s seventh edition of the guide also proposes the use of jammer, Libavirin or Abidore with hydrochloric acid.
Preliminary data indicate that the high dosage of Libaverin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Following confirmation of the low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, further in vivo studies are recommended using nitronett. The study showed that the original stupor proteins triggered by diaphragm protein filamentate 2 (TMPRSS2) are necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to interact with an ACE2 receptor to enter the human body.
There are serious limitations in the study of chlor and hydroxychloroquine, whether or not used in conjunction with Achcin, and the medical community is unable to accept these treatments unless further research is carried out.
Cell-factor storm could be a COVID-19 aftercare complication.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may be resistant to cytofactor storms ... After a small study was completed, the National Board of Health and Health of China included beads in the treatment guidelines.
After testing positive for patients with severe diseases, Italy is conducting two non-random tests at the national level.
Combining seroprotein blood testing and identifying cytogenoid storms, which are supposed to lead to the death of some infected persons, is designed to curb the development of the disease.
In 2017, supported by retrospective case studies, the FDA approved the use of white cell media6 receptor stressor treatment for other causes-induced corrosive steroid emission syndrome, known as CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there has been no random cross-check to prove that the beads are effective against treatment, CRS.
Research is currently under way to extract pure concentrate antibodies from the COVID-19 immune system of the rehabilitated, inject them into those who need them, as passive immunotherapy until the vaccine is developed.
SARS tried this strategy during the outbreak, but the cure is still inconclusive.
The virus is an expected mechanism for the immune defence of SARS-CoV-2 passive antibody therapy.
However, other mechanisms such as antibodies dependent on cell toxicity and/or osmosis can achieve the same effect ...
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of artificial monoclon antibodies, are being developed.
The serum is made up of liquid parts of the recovered patient's blood, containing specific antibodies for the virus.
The coronary virus disease, a closely related syndrome.
Dr. Lee Wenqing, a doctor at Wuhan City Hospital, raised awareness of the spread of the new coronary virus, then unfortunately contracted COVID-19 and died.
