Kano, a famous but controversial English teacher who taught under the banner of modern and royal education, claimed to have 9,000 students at the peak of his career.
In his notes, he used some of the words that his parents thought were vulgar, and he was said to have used indecent language in the classroom.
Modern education accuses him of publishing a big ad on a bus without permission and of lying about being the chief English tutor.
He's been accused of violating copyrights before, but he's not charged.

In the last 30 years, China has developed its market economy, even though it is still officially a communist country.
The first economic reform was led by Dun Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economic size has grown 90 times.
Last year, China exported more cars than Germany for the first time and the United States became the largest market for automobiles.
China’s gross domestic product may exceed the US in 20 years.
Daniella was formed east of the Atlantic Ocean, the fourth named hurricane in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.
The storm is about 3000 miles from Miami, Florida, with a maximum wind rate of 40 miles per hour (64 km per hour).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predicted that Danielle would increase to hurricane on or before Wednesday.
The storm is still a while away from landing, and it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the US or the Caribbean.

" luckily I didn't do anything, but I saw a terrible scene when people tried to break the window and get out.
People knock on windows with chairs, but the windows don't break.
The survivor, Francesek Koval, said, "One of the glass is finally broken and they're getting out of the window."
The stars produce light and heat because when the hydrogen atoms merge together to form heavier elements, they generate energy.
Scientists are working to create reactors that generate energy in the same way.
However, the problem is very difficult to solve, and it will take years to build a useful fusion reactor.
The needle will float on the surface because of the surface tension.
The occurrence of surface tension is more attractive among water molecules from the surface than between them and the upper air molecules.
Water molecules form an invisible surface on the surface so that needles and stuff can float on the surface.
The blades of modern skates have two blades, and there's a pit between them.
Because the bottom of the blade is crooked, when the blade is tilted to one side, the edge of the ice is crooked.
If the skater turns to the right, the skater turns to the right, and if the skater turns to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To return to the original level of energy, the atom must remove the extra energy from the light.
They're done through the launch of a microlight particle called "photo."
Scientists call this process "irradiated radiation" because atoms are highly irritated, resulting in photons in the light, which is a kind of radiation.
The next image shows atom-emitting photons, which are, of course, much smaller in reality than what is seen in this picture.
Photons are even smaller than atoms!
After hundreds of hours of use, the lights in the light bulb will eventually burn down and the light bulb will no longer be used.
And then the light bulb needs to be changed.
First, we need to turn off the lights or cut the wires.
It's because if you touch the bottom of some metal inside the plug or part of the light bulb, the current that flows into the plug (i.e., the location of the light bulb metal part) can cause you to have severe electrical contact.
The main organ of the recycle system is the heart responsible for pumping blood.
Blood flows from a pipe called the artery, and from a pipe called the vein back to the heart.
Triangular dinosaurs can crush not only leaves, but even very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists think Triceratops eat iron, a plant that's common in the white age.
These plants look like a little palm tree, a twirl.
Triangular dragons may use their strong beaks to skin leaves before they feed on the trunks.
Other scientists argue that these plants are highly toxic, so no dinosaurs are likely to eat them, but other animals today, such as weaves and berylliums, can eat toxic leaves or fruits.
How does the Earth's gravity hold me? If you stand on the surface of the Earth, it's lighter than on the surface of the Earth.
A man weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth, and he weighs 36 pounds (16 kg). It's obvious that Io's gravity is smaller.
The sun doesn't have a crust like the Earth that allows you to stand on top of it.
The farther away from the center of the sun, the thinner the gas.
And what we see in the sun is called the light sphere.
About 3,000 years later, the Italian astronomer Galileo used the telescope to see the stars as if they were the moon.
Venus (or the moon) is only on the face of the sun, so there's profit and loss.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, the British astronomer, Jeremy Hollox, observed Venus Leng Day.
England has experienced a long period of peace after taking Denmark again.
However, in 991, Eserred met the largest Viking fleet since the last-century Gutrum fleet.

Sanskrit is an ancient language that is comparable to the Latin used in Europe.
The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit, and after the book was written, Sanskrit disappeared as the equivalent system.
The Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, as many modern Indian languages come from, like Latin is from European languages such as French and Spanish.
With the end of the war with France, Germany is preparing to invade Britain.
The German code name for the attack was "Operation Sea Lions." The British lost most of their heavy weapons and supplies when Duncock withdrew, and the army was therefore very weak.
But the Royal Navy is still much stronger than the German Navy and can destroy any invading fleet that crosses the English Channel.
However, as the Admiral feared that the ship would be sunk by a German air strike, only a small number of Royal Navy ships were stunned near the more promising route of the invasion.
Let's start by explaining Italy's plan.
Even if they had just built four new ships before the war, its army and navy were still weak.
In order to take over these countries, Italy will need a place where troops can travel across the Mediterranean to invade Africa.
Apart from these operations, Italian ships are not expected to do anything else.
Japan, like England, is an island.
The submarine was designed to sail underwater and stay for a long time.
The submarines were used during World War I and World War II, when they were very slow and very limited in range.
In the early years of the war, most of them sailed at sea, but as the radar developed, it became more precise, the submarines were forced to sail underwater to avoid detection.
The German submarines are called U-boats.
Because of their success in submarines, Germany is not trusted to own many submarines after the war.
Yes! King Tutankhamen is sometimes also known as King Tut or King of Boys, one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings of modern times.
Interestingly, he wasn't valued in ancient times, and most ancient kings had no record of him.

We know a lot of Greek politicians, scientists and artists. The most famous of Greek culture is Homer, a legendary visual poet who has written two great Greek literatures: Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophokles and Aristophine are still the most famous writers, and their plays are recognized by the public as one of the greatest works in world literature.
Another famous Greek is a mathematician, Pythagoras, most famously his theorem of the straight-angle triangle.
The Indian language is estimated to be the second to fourth language spoken by the largest number of people in the world.
The number of people who speak the native language is different depending on whether the language is very close or not.
It is estimated that there are between 340 and 500 million users of the language, and that 800 million people can understand the language.
In everyday conversations, users of both languages can understand each other.
In the 15th century, northern Estonia was heavily influenced by German culture.
Some German monks invented the language of Estonian to bring God closer to the local people.
It's taken from the German alphabet and added a character called "sniff."
With the passage of time, many words borrowed from Germany have been integrated.
Traditionally, the heirs to the throne will join the army as soon as they complete their studies.

Turkey in Europe (East of Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkans) accounts for three percent of the country.
Turkey has more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) of land, 800 miles (500 miles), roughly a rectangular shape.
Turkey's national territory includes lakes, accounting for 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) are located south-west of Asia, while 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 square miles) are located in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world, in terms of volume, about the sum of France and England.
Turkey is surrounded by three seas: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back to 1839.
Today's part of Belgium was part of Luxembourg, but after the Belgian revolution in the 1830s it became part of Belgium.
Luxembourg has been trying to maintain its neutral role, but it was occupied by Germany during World War I and World War II.
Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization in 1957, which today is known as the European Union.
A fort and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of Phondey Village.
Zabron Awan Nangel built this fort in 1649 in memory of his defeat of the Tibetan Mongolian army.
In 1951, only part of the trail of a fire that led to Joke Jejuburg could be preserved. The painting of Zabron Awan Nangel was one of them.
The Fortress was protected and protected after the fire and became one of Bhutan's most attractive attractions.
In the 18th century, Cambodia found itself in the middle of a clipping between two powerful neighboring countries, Thailand and Vietnam.
Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
The Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia at the end of the 18th century.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of them are engaged in informal economic activities.
Three-thirds of Venezuelans work in the service industry, nearly one-fourth of our people work in factories, and one-fifth of our people work in farming.
Although only one percent of the population is involved in the oil industry, oil is an important industry in Venezuela because Venezuela is a clean exporter of oil.
In the early days of national independence, the Singapore Botanical Garden's expertise helped the island to shake itself into a hot garden city.
In 1981, a hybrid orchid named Cheuk Mandaran was chosen as the national flower of this country.
Around October each year, nearly 1.5 million herbivores cross the Mala River from the northern hills to the southern plains for rain.

Learning to develop interactive media skills for regularity and tradition, as well as tools available in interactive classes (scoreboards, audio and video editors, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to re-evaluate assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
The interactive design requires that the components of the project be connected to each other, but at the same time become a single entity.
In order to reach a certain focal length, the weakness of the focus lens is that the complexity of the focus and the number of elements required for the lens is higher than the focus lens.
It's not a problem, because the producers are able to produce a higher-caliber camera.
This allows the curvature camera to take pictures of the quality of the curvature as good as the curvature.
The other flaw in the focus lens is that it's usually lower than the maximum aperture (velocity) of the lens.
It's hard to use cheap curvature cameras in low-light environments without flashlights.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert the film to DVD format is overscanning.
Most TV shows are designed to please the public.
So all the shows you saw on TV, the top, the bottom, and the sides, were cut off.
It's to make sure the image covers the entire screen.
Unfortunately, when you make DVDs, it's likely that its boundaries will be cut off, and if the subtitles are too close to the bottom, they won't be shown in their entirety.
The traditional castle of the Middle Ages always inspires imagination, fights, feasts and the sights of King Arthur's knights.
Even standing in the ruins of a millennium's history, the mimics smell war, hear the sound of horses' feet on the pebbles, and feel the fear in the dungeon.
But is our imagination based only on reality? Why are castles created at first? How are they designed and built?
It was more like a solid house than a real castle.
Its large windows and thin walls cannot withstand a sustained attack.
In the 1480s, the castle was built by Lord Hastings, when the country was more peaceful than ever, just to guard against the bandits.
The balance of power is a system in which European countries seek to uphold the sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept has to be seen in all European countries to prevent one of them from becoming stronger, so governments often switch allies in order to keep the balance.
The first war, with power balance at its centre, was marked by the succession of the Spanish throne.
This marked a major shift, because European powers could no longer use religion as an excuse for war, and the 30-year war was thus called the last religious war.
The Atimis temple in Ephesus was destroyed on July 20th, 356 B.C., and Herosdatus admitted that he set the fire.
According to his words, his motive was to gain a reputation, even by any means possible.
Fortunately, the Greek historian Strabo wrote his name down, and that's why we found out today that this temple was destroyed the same night that Alexander was born.
Alexander, who was an emperor, offered to pay for the restoration of the temple, but was refused, and then, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.
Make sure your hands are as relaxed as possible and that all the notes are struck correctly - and try not to let your fingers move too much.
It's a way to reduce fatigue as much as possible, and remember that there's no need to play the piano like a piano to increase the volume.
To increase the volume of the accordion, you can put more pressure or speed in the windbox.
Mystics seek the ultimate truth, the divine, the spiritual truth or the communication with God, and seek recognition and self-consciousness.
Those who believe in it will seek direct experience, intuition or insight in the sacred reality.
Followers pursue certain lifestyles or practice designed to nurture those experiences.
Mysticism, unlike other forms of religious belief and worship, highlights the direct personal experience of a particular ideology, especially those who are calm, perceptive, happy and even exultant.
The Zik religion is a religion from the Indian subcontinent, which originated in the Punjab in the fifteenth century from the sectarian division of Hindu tradition.
The Sikhs believe that their faith is a religion separate from Hinduism, even though they recognize its roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion the Gurmat, the Punjabi "Guru Road", which is fundamental in all Hindu religions, but its importance is at the heart of the Sikh faith.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Grunanak (1469-1539), followed by nine Gulus.
But in June 1956, Khrushchev's promise was tested, when there was a riot in Poland, where local workers turned from protest against food shortages and salary cuts to protest against the communists as a whole.
Although in the end Khrushchev sent tanks to restore order, he gave way to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Vadislaw Gomorrka as the new Prime Minister.
The Indus Valley civilization is a copper age civilization located in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent. It encompasses most parts of modern Pakistan, as well as parts of northwest India and northeast Afghanistan.
The civilization flourished in the Indian river basin, so it came up with the name.
Although some scholars have speculated that, since this civilization exists in the now defunct Salasvati River Basin, it should be officially known as the Insa River Civilization, while others name it Harapa, known as the Harapa Civilization.
The Roman Empire's militarism has advanced in the form of medical aid.
Augustus the Great began recruiting doctors and even set up the first Roman medical team at the time to treat the injuries caused by the war.
Surgeons have all kinds of sedated knowledge, such as morphine in seed extraction and ostrich in seedlings.
They're good at amputations, saving patients from gangrene, and using tourniquets and arteries to stop blood flow.
For centuries, the Roman Empire has produced huge gains in the field of medicine and has shaped much of what we know today.
Clean paper is a one-size-fits-all paper genre that can't use more complicated techniques, such as internal flipping, and each has an easy position to understand.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people with less experience or limited mobility skills.
Children have developed racial and racial stereotypes at a very young age, and these stereotypes affect their behaviour.
For example, when children know that their minority ethnic group is largely stigmatized as being underperforming at school, their performance at school tends to be worse.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States, with 54 million users.
These sites attract a lot of attention, especially in education.
These sites have a lot of positive implications, including the ease with which they can create classroom pages, which can include weblogs, videos, photos and other features.
It's easy to visit a page with a single URL, easier to remember and enter for students who are not good at using keyboards and spelling.
It can be customised to make it easier to read and to add or reduce colours as necessary.
Focusing on power deficiency is a neuro-system syndrome, typical of three types of symptoms, i.e. impulsive, distracted and over-motivated."
It's not an obstacle to learning, it's a failure; it affects three to five percent of the children, possibly two million more.
Children with insufficient focus can't concentrate on certain things, such as school homework, but they can focus on things they love, such as playing games, watching favorite cartoons or writing sentences that don't have a symbol.
These kids are often in trouble because they use "dangerous behavior, fighting, and challenging power" to stimulate the brain, which is because it can't get it in the normal way.
Focusing on stress disorder affects relationships with other generations, because other children don't understand why patients have these behaviors and problems, or why they have different levels of maturity.
The ability to learn and learn changes in the manner mentioned above, and the efficiency of acquiring knowledge changes.
The way to access information is no longer the same. Pressure does not exist in personal memory, the focus becomes the ability to remember words.
Renaissance has shown itself to change the way in which learning and knowledge are transmitted.
The primitives are different from other primates, they don't move with their hands anymore, they carry weight or they rock in the trees.
The palms of chimpanzees are similar in size and length to the soles of the feet, reflecting the heavy use of the hands as they walk through their fingers.
Man's hands are smaller than his feet and his fingers are sharper.
Two million to three million years ago, hand bone fossils revealed that the hand had been converted from mobile to operational.
Some people believe it's exhausting to experience these people's sober dreams.
The main reason for this is that awakening dreams prolong the time between rapid eye contact and sleep.
The less time you sleep in the eye every night, the less time you get real sleep and body recovery, the less time you get to a certain extent.
It's like waking up every 20 or 30 minutes to watch TV.
The impact depends on the frequency of your brain trying to dream awake every night.
Almost from the very beginning, the situation of the Italians in North Africa went bad. On June 10th, 1940, a week after Italy declared war, the 11th British cavalry took over fort Captzoburg in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Latucci, the chief engineer of the 10th Italian Army.
On June 28th, apparently the heir of Mussolini, Commander-in-Chief Italobalbo, was killed by artillery fire from his friends in Land Tobruk.
There are many different levels of modern sports such as swordsmanship, ranging from students studying in universities to professional swordsmen in Olympic competitions.
This sport is mainly conducted in a two-person mode, with one swordsman playing against another.
Golf is a game where a golfer hits a hole with a golf club.
The standard round has 18 holes, and the player usually starts at the first hole in the field and ends at the eighteenth hole.
All the holes in the field were won with a minimum number of poles or swings.
The movement takes place on the grass, and the grass around the hole is cut short and called fruit.
The most common way to travel is perhaps the knowledge of travel by a large number of people: leisure travel.
People go to places that are very different from their daily lives to relax and have fun.
The beach, the theme park and the camping area are the most frequent places for tourists to visit.
If a person is visiting a place to understand the history and culture of the place, this kind of travel is called a cultural journey.
Visitors can visit different landmarks in a country or choose to focus on one of them.
The colonizers saw these events and called for reinforcements.
The deployment of the forward positions of the army, including Colonel John Stark and Colonel James Reed (both of whom became generals), led by the First and Third Regiments of the new Hampshire, with a total of 200 soldiers.
Stark's soldiers took the northern end of the colonizers along the fence.
As the tide receded and a gap opened along the mysterious river in the northeast of the island, they quickly extended the fence with a small stone wall, reaching northwards to the water edge of the beach.
Greeley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet in front of the fence and ordered that no fire be opened until regular personnel approved it.
The U.S. plans to launch coordinated attacks in three different directions.
General John Cadwald shot the English garrison in Borden to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing led 700 militiamen across the Trenton pier, took the bridge from Arsenpink Creek and prevented any enemy from escaping.
The main strike team of 2400 men will cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, then split into two groups, one following Green and the other following Sullivan, in order to launch the pre-dawn offensive.
When it turns from four to a half miles, speed is less important, and endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
A first-rate half-mile runner with a two-minute line must maintain a significant speed, but at the same time have the resilience to respond to all crises.
Some winter run-overs, the upper half of the gym, are the best preparation for the run.
But it can be effective in improving the overall health of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, developing effective water supplementation habits, and understanding the various aspects of supplementary training can help athletes improve their performance and make them enjoy their sport.
Middle-range run is a relatively cheap sport; however, there are still a lot of misunderstandings about the number of devices needed to participate.
They can buy products as needed, but in most cases they have only a slight or no real impact on performance.
The sportsmen may be interested in a product, even if it does not bring any practical benefit.
Atoms are considered to be part of the foundation of all matter.
According to the simplified Bolt model, it is a very complex entity, with a central nuclei surrounded by electrons, similar to planets orbiting the Sun - fig. 1.1.
The core is made up of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons with a positive charge, neutrons with no charge.
Before you examine the wounded, you must examine the circumstances to make sure you're safe.
You need to keep an eye on the wounded when you touch them and any dangerous alarms.
If you're hurt while trying to help, you might just make things worse.
Research shows the relationship between depression, fear and disaster, and the pain and disability of people with back pains.
Only the impact of the disaster can vary depending on the regular weekly system activity, and depression and fear will not.
Those who participate regularly need more support for the negative perception of pain, so that they can distinguish between chronic pain and the inappropriateness of normal physical action.
The ability to see or see depends on the sensory organs or eyes of the visual system.
There are many different structures in the eyes, and different degrees of complexity depend on the needs of the living.
Different structures have different functions, they have different sensor wavelengths, different sensitivity, and they need different processing processes to understand input images and different numbers to achieve optimal performance.
Population or total number is defined as a group of specific species within a given geographical range.
When one of the species has exactly the same appearance, it's called a single type.
When a body displays a specific variety of variations, it's a plethora of forms.
The ants will move and nest at different stages.
In the nomadic sector, ants move at night, and by day they stop to camp.
When the available food is reduced, the ants begin the nomadic phase, where the ants change their temporary lairs every day.
Each visit or migration will last about 17 days.
The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room," initially proposed by microscopes who observe the structure of the cork.
Cells are the basic unit of all organisms, and all organisms are made of one or more cells.
Cells are the foundation and the key to studying life. In fact, they're often called "the building blocks of life."
The nervous system sustains the internal balance by creating a neurological impulse in the body, which keeps the blood flowing unobstructed.
These neurological impulses can be rapidly transmitted throughout the body, helping to protect the body from any potential threat.
It's smaller than any other violent storm, but it destroys everything in its path.
The tornado pulls out the trees, pulls out the boards on the buildings and rolls the cars into the sky. 2% of the strong tornado can last more than 3 hours.
These giant storms are up to 480 km/hour (133 m/s; 300 miles/hour).
For thousands of years, humans have been producing and using lenses for magnifying purposes.
But the first real telescope was made in Europe in the late 16th century.
These goggles combine the two lenses, making things look bigger and closer from afar.
Greed and selfishness can't be separated from us, and when most people benefit from cooperation, selfish behaviour can always lead to more short-term benefits for others, which is one of the essence of cooperation.
It is hoped that many will realize that working with each other is the best way to work together.
Many dream that one day humans can travel to other planets and explore other worlds, and some wonder what's out there, and some believe that there are aliens or other lives on another planet.
But if it's true, it won't last long.
Perhaps one day, your great-grandchildren will think about their ancestors in the world of aliens?
Animals are made up of a large number of cells that feed and digest within their bodies, most of them move.
Only animals have brains.
The earth is full of animals, some digging holes in the ground, some swimming in the sea, some flying in the sky.
Cells are the most basic unit of structure and function of life.
The cell word comes from the Latin word cella, meaning the small room.
If you look at the creatures under the microscope, you'll find they're made of tiny squares or spheres.
The English biologist Robert Hook, under the microscope, saw the small square structure of a soft tree.
They look like a room. He's the first person to see a dead cell.
Elements and compounds can be converted from one state to another, and remain unchanged.
Nitrogen, though a gas, still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen, and the liquid state is more dense, but the molecules are the same.
Water is another example, made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, which belongs to the compound.
The molecular structure is the same whether it's gas, liquid or solid.
The state of physics may change, but the state of chemistry doesn't.
Time is always around us, affecting everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
Religion, philosophy and science have studied time for thousands of years.
We feel the passage of time through a series of futures, now and in the past.
Time is also the way we compare the length of our activities.
You can record the passage of time by observing the repetition of a regular event.
Today's computer is used to process pictures and videos.
Computers can make complex animations, which are becoming more common in television and movies.
Music is usually recorded by cutting-edge computers, processing and mixing sound.
In the 19th to 20th century, it was widely recognized that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Māori, who made their living by hunting a giant bird known as a bird of fear.
This theory also establishes the concept of Maori leaving the country in a flotilla, taking New Zealand from the Moriolis, and developing an agricultural society.
But there's new evidence that the Morioli are actually a group of Maori who moved from New Zealand to Chatham Island and developed their own unique culture of peace.
There's another tribe on Chatham Island. They're Maori from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriolis. After a little conflict, the Moriolis were destroyed.
Those who have been involved in the past few decades have helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions, to assess them frankly and even to fail.
After listening to you share your own, family and institutional stories, we have been able to learn more about the past and about some of the people who have had a positive or negative impact on the culture of the institution.
Understanding their history does not mean understanding their culture, but at least it helps people understand their place in the history of the organization.
When evaluating success and recognizing failure, individuals and participants will explore the deeper value, mission and motivation of the institution.
In this situation, looking back at the examples of past corporate behavior and leadership, it helps people accept new changes in the local church and move in a new direction.
It's time for success stories to reduce people's fear of change and at the same time make people more willing to accept future changes.
Coherent thinking is a technique to solve problems by bringing together different ideas and models to find solutions.
The focus of this thinking is on speed, logic and accuracy, and the understanding of facts, the re-application of existing techniques and the collection of data.
The most important factor in this thinking is that there's only one right answer, and you'll come up with only two answers, right or wrong.
This way of thinking is linked to certain scientific or standard procedures.
People who think like this have logic, can remember the pattern, solve problems and run scientific tests.
Human beings are the most understandable species of other similar ideas today.
It means we can predict other people's perceptions, intentions, beliefs, perceptions or thirst.
Understanding the intentions of others is particularly important in these abilities, which enable us to better identify the differences that arise in the movement of limbs.
For example, if you see someone break a window, you'll have a great chance to assume he's trying to steal someone else's car.
If he loses his keys and tries to break his window, he needs a different judgment.
Magnetic resonance is based on a physical reality called the NMR, which was discovered in 1930 by Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell.
In this resonance, magnetic fields and wireless waves give the atom a weak wireless signal.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a doctor and scientist, discovered the basis for using MRI images as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, it was approved for the first time in the world in the magnetic resonance field.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first full-body magnetic resonator scanner, which he called the "Talk-A-Talk."
Non-synchronous communications provide time for reflection and response.
This allows students to learn at their own pace and to control the pace of indicative information.
In addition, flexible working hours reduce time limits. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to access information at any time.
Students can also question their mentors at any time of the day and can expect a response soon, without waiting until the next class.
There's more than one way to learn.
In fact, there's no single good thing to learn.
All the self-taughts we've got now, as well as the information-learning TV shows that tell us that.
A lot of people will find themselves watching a TV show that shows the way and the experience that we'll never be involved in or applied to.
We'll never renovate cars, build fountains in the backyard, visit ancient sites in Peru or renovate houses next door.
The Internet in Greenland is good, with 93% of the people on the Internet.
Your hotel or homeowner (if you live in a hotel or a private house) may have a wifi or Internet-connected computer, a net bar or a public wifi in all settlements.
As mentioned above, while the word "Eskimo" is still acceptable in the United States, many non-American North Poles (especially Canadians) find it misleading.
Although you might hear the word used in Greenland, foreigners should avoid it.
Native Greenlanders call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq in Greenland.
In Greenland, there's almost no crime and no enemy to foreign people.
The cold weather is probably the only real danger to the underprepared.
If you're visiting Greenland in the cold season, you have to bring enough warm clothes.
The long summer days lead to sleep deprivation and related health problems.
In the summer, care is to be taken of the mosquitoes in northern Europe.
Although San Francisco's economy is linked to a world-class tourist destination, its economy is diversified.
The biggest jobs are in professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
It often appears in music, movies, literature and popular culture, branding the city and its landscape.
San Francisco has developed a major tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and first-class conference facilities.
San Francisco is one of the best places in the United States.
Pilgrimage to the Warn Disney World is the dream of many American families.
"Specific" travels include flying to Orlando International Airport, driving to the Disney Hotel, not leaving Disney District for a week, then going home.
People play differently, but that's most people's understanding of the term "go to Disney."
Many of the tickets sold online through auction sites like eBay or Craigslist have been used for some of the days.
Although re-selling is now widespread, other Disneys have banned such practices: tickets are not subject to diversion.
Anyone camping under the edge of the Grand Canyon needs a field permit.
To protect the canyon, the permits are limited and are available on the first day of the 4th month of camping.
As a result, field permits that began on any day of May began to be issued on January 1st.
The most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel camp near the Phantom Ranch, usually receive a large number of reservations on the first day when the reservation is open.
A small number of permits are reserved on a first-come, first-served basis for unscheduled guests.
Drives into southern Africa is a wonderful way to enjoy the beauty of the whole region, and also to travel beyond the normal tour route.
Under careful planning, a normal car can do that, but it's highly recommended that 4x4 be used, and that only 4x4 vehicles with high wheel ranges be available at many locations.
In planning, remember, not all neighbouring countries are as stable as southern Africa.
The visa requirements and fees vary from country to country and are influenced by the country from which you come.
Every country has a unique law that requires emergency items in the car.
Victoria Falls is in a town west of Zimbabwe, across the Zambia's Livingstone border, near Bozana.
The town is close to the main point of the waterfall, but it's this popular tourist attraction that attracts a large number of explorers and tourists who are willing to stay longer.
During the rainy season (November to March), the water will increase, and the waterfall will look much better.
If you cross the bridge or walk along a trail near the waterfall, you'll get wet.
On the other hand, because of the amount of water you see, you can't see the waterfall.
KV62 is probably the most famous mausoleum in King's Valley, discovered by Howard Carter in 1922, as an almost intact young king's royal mausoleum.
However, compared to most of the other royal mausoleums, the Tutankhamen mausoleum is not much worth visiting because it is small and not much decorated.
Anyone interested in causing harm to the mummies when they're out of the ground will be disappointed, because only the head and shoulder can be seen.
The mausoleum no longer contains a huge amount of collateral, all of which was transferred to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
It is suggested that tourists with only a small amount of time should visit elsewhere.
Kim Crom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap, the temple on the top of the mountain was built at the end of the 9th century, at the time of King Yasovaman's reign.
The vibe of the temple and the view of the cave of Lake Saa have made your climb worth your ticket.
In addition to visiting the site, we can travel by boat to the lake.
You need Wu's ticket to enter the temple, so take your passport when you go to Lake Cave.
Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and the largest city, but most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as the capital of Israel.
This ancient city, sitting on Mount Judea, has a fascinating history that extends for thousands of years.
The city is a spiritual, religious and cultural centre of the three monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
Jerusalem is one of Israel's main tourist destinations because of the religious significance of the city, especially in the old city.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, as well as dynamic and crowded shopping centres, coffee shops and restaurants.
In Ecuador, Cuban citizens are required to receive invitations to enter Ecuador through international airports or border entry points.
The letter must be certified by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and meet certain requirements.
These demands are made to provide organized migration between the two countries.
Cuban citizens holding a green card in the United States should be granted immunity from the Ecuadorian Consulate.
Your passport must be valid at least six months after your travel date, and a return/renewal ticket to prove your stay.
It's cheaper for larger groups, so if you're alone or with only one companion, try to identify others and form a four-or-six-person group, you get a per capita price.
However, that's not what you really should worry about, because tourists are often assigned randomly to fill cars.
It's actually more like a form of deception that makes them think they have to pay more money.
This steep mountain peak, at the north end of Machu Picchu, is often the background to many of the photographs of this legacy.
It's a little scary down there, it's steep, it's hard to climb, but most people in good health should be able to do it in 45 minutes.
Most sections of the road are stoned, and in the steeper part, the wire can be a support arm.
In other words, be prepared to stay out of breath, be careful where it's steep, especially when it's wet, because it's likely to be dangerous soon.
There's a little hole near the top that has to go through.
Boating is the best way to visit the Galapagos islands and to see wild animals, as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships travel regularly to and from the Galapagos Islands, carrying between 8 and 100 people.
Most people pre-positioned in advance (because the ship is usually full during the season).
Remember to make sure that the agents you've been assigned are Galapagos experts who know all kinds of ships.
This will ensure that your particular interests and/or limitations match the ships best suited to them.
Before the arrival of the 16th century Spaniards, the northern part of Chile was ruled by the Incas, while the indigenous Araucani (Mapuch) lived in the central and southern parts of Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent indigenous tribes in the United States until the independence of Chile was fully ruled by Spanish.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the years of the Napoleonic War, Spain lost a functioning central government), it did not win a decisive victory over Spain until 1818.
Dominican Republic is a Caribbean nation that occupies the eastern half of the island of Ispaniola shared with Haiti.
In addition to the white beach and mountain view, this country is home to the oldest European city in the Americas and is now part of Santo Domingo.
The Tenor and the Caribs first lived on this island, and the Caribs were the Arawaks, who came here about 10,000 years before B.C.
Just a few years after the arrival of European explorers, the population of the Tenoss was greatly reduced by the Spanish conquerors.
According to Frei Bartolo Medraskasas, the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 Tenos between 1492 and 1498.

Cook Islands is an island country located in Polynesia in the central South Pacific, and is a free association with New Zealand.
The islands are made up of 15 islands scattered over 2.2 million square kilometres of ocean.
Because of the same time zone as Hawaii, these islands are sometimes considered to be "the bottom Hawaiian".
Although small, it reminds some older tourists of Hawaii, which did not have all the major hotels and other development projects before becoming a state.
Although Cook Islands have no cities, they are made up of 15 different islands.
In today's countries, the luxurious bed and breakfast have become an art.
In the high-profile market, residential accommodation competes in two main areas: bedding and breakfast.
So people tend to find the most luxurious beddings, probably handmade blankets or antique beds, in such a delicate setting.
Breakfast may include local cuisine or master-cooked specialty.
The scene may be an old building of historic significance, where there's ancient fragrance furniture, a well-refined grassland and a swimming pool.

The history of some hotels can be traced back to the golden age of steam railways and cruise ships (i.e., before the 19th century or the Second World War of the 20th century).
These hotels were used by rich, famous people, usually with fine meals and night life.
Old-fashioned equipment, lack of state-of-the-art facilities, and some sort of elegant old smell are some of their features.
Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes provide accommodation for visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.
A traveler with a lot of money might consider breaking up travel around the world, staying in a lot of these hotels.
The customer network is an organization that connects tourists with the locals of the city to which they are going.
Joining a network like this usually requires only filling out forms on the Internet; however, some networks provide or request additional verifications.

Although the International Park Fair is theoretically available once a year (in different countries), it is not.
The event usually lasts three to six months and is held on at least 50 square meters.
The standard 35 mm negative is the most common.
When it's done, it's usually easy to replace, and the solver is the same as today's digital reverse camera.
Some of the philin cameras are in 6 x 6 cm format, more precisely 56 x 56 mm negative.
It's about four times the resolution of the 35 mm negative (3136 square millimetres compared to 864 square millimetres).
Catching wild animals is the biggest challenge to photographers, with a lot of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wild animal photography seems to be simple, but in fact, any photograph, one of which represents a thousand words.
Wild animal photography usually requires a long focus lens, while filming a group of birds or tiny creatures requires other lenses.
Many strange animals are hard to find, and the park sometimes sets rules for business filming.
Wild animals may be shy or aggressive, the environment may be cold, hot or extreme.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, more than 20 of which have 50 million or more users.
Moreover, writing is often easier to understand than oral text, which is particularly obvious in the call language, because it is often difficult for them to pronounce clearly.
All of us in many countries speak fluent English, and in more countries they speak limited English — especially young people.

Mooses are not inherently aggressive, but if they feel threatened, they defend themselves.
When people don't think that the moose is potentially dangerous, they may be too close to the moose to put themselves in danger.
The effect of alcohol on everyone is different, and it's important to know how much alcohol you drink.
Overdrinking can lead to long-term health problems, including liver damage, even blindness and death. Drinking illegally produced alcohol increases the potential risk.
Irregular alcohol may contain dangerous compounds that include methanol, and even small amounts can lead to blindness or death.
Foreign glasses may be cheaper, especially in low-income countries with lower labour costs.
Consider an eye check at the place of residence (especially in the case of insurance) and then take the eye check to another location.

Canyon movement (or streaming) is about entering the bottom of the canyon, which may be dry or water-filled.
The canyon movement combines sports elements such as swimming, climbing and jumping, but the canyon movement initially requires less training and lower body size requirements than rock climbing, pulmonary diving or high-altitude skiing.
Excursion like this means walking in nature, usually on a hilltop.
A day's distance includes less than a mile to a longer distance that can be completed within a day.

It's something you have to keep your eyes open so that you don't get disappointed or even sick of local ways of doing things.
Travel agencies have emerged since the 19th century. Travel agencies are usually a good choice when they go beyond the experience of tourists in their natural environment, culture, language or travel to low-income countries.
While most travel agencies accept general travel reservations, many travel societies provide specific types of travel, budget range or destination.
It's better to choose a travel agency that most of the journeys are similar to yours.
Look at the travel agency's expansive journey, whether it's on the website or in the shop window.
If you want to see the world cheaply, whether it's to save money, experience life or challenge, there are ways to do it.

Registration is an additional condition to the visa process. In some countries, you must register your data and address to the local authorities.
This may require the local police station or immigration office to fill out the forms.
In many countries where this is the rule, registration will be facilitated by local hotels.
There are other examples where only passengers who live outside normal tourist accommodation are required to register. But this makes the rules even more vague, so it must be clear first.
Building and researching the design and construction of buildings.
A lot of buildings look beautiful, and the view that you see from a high-rise or from a window in a delicate position makes you look beautiful.
Construction and city planning, civil engineering, decorative art, interior design and other areas, such as landscape design, have a considerable overlap.
Given the remoteness of Pweblow, if you don't get to Albuquerque or Santa Fe, you won't be able to find a lot of night life.

Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth, surrounded by the South Pole.
Travel costs are high and require good health and can only take place between November and February in the summer, and are mainly limited to the islands, islands and the Ross Sea.
In summer, thousands of workers lived here, about 50 in these areas; very few stayed for the winter.
Within Antarctica is a desolate plateau covered by 2-3 km of ice.
Sometimes there's a dedicated air travel team going inland, climbing or visiting the South Pole with a large base.
The Southern Pole is a 1600-km road linking the McMurdo base in the Ross Sea to the Antarctic Point.
The road is filled with solid and cracky snow, marked by a flag, which only crosses on a dedicated tractor with fuel and supplies.
They're not very lively, so the route has to turn around the South Pole to reach the plateau.
Most of the most frequent accidents in winter occur on wet roads, pedestrian roads and, especially, steps.
At least, you need shoes that fit the soles of your shoes, and summer shoes are usually slippery on the ice, and even some winter boots aren't enough.
The mass is at least 5 mm (1/5 inch) deep, and the mass is soft enough in cold weather.
Some of the boots have nails and some of the additional equipment with nails to cover the slide, for most of the shoes and boots, for heel or heel and soles.
The heel should be low and wide.
The avalanche is not an anomaly; the steep slope can only bear a certain amount of snow, and the extra amount of snow will fall in the form of an avalanche.
The problem is, the snow is sticky, so it takes a few triggers to get down, and a part of it could trigger the rest of the snow belt.
Sometimes the initial triggers are warm snow, sometimes snow increases, sometimes other natural events, but usually human.
The tornado is a very low-pressure rotor column that breathes air from the surroundings inside and up.
They produce strong winds (usually 100 to 200 miles an hour), they can roll heavy objects up half-empty, and they move them as the tornado moves.
It starts with a funnel landing from a storm cloud, and when they touch the ground, they turn into a "roller."
Personal VPN providers are the best way to avoid political censorship and commercial IP filtering.
Some of the reasons why they are better than web agents are that they are rerouting all the traffic through the Internet, not just http://www.flickr.com/photos/photos/photos/photos/
They usually provide higher bandwidth and better quality of service. They're encrypted, so it's harder to be watched.
Media companies often lie about their purpose, claiming it's about "preventing piracy".
In fact, the regional code has no effect on illegal copying; a bit-to-bit copy of a disk can be shown on any device that can be successfully played in the original.
In fact, the aim is to give these companies more control over the market; it's all about making money.
You don't have to use a phone company at a place of residence or travel, because you're connected to the Internet.

Usually, you have to buy a global number alone, so that you can have a public phone exchange to call you.
The actual text translation application is an application that automatically translates the entire text paragraph from one language to another.
Some applications in this template can even translate foreign language texts on smartphones when users point them to logos or other objects in the real world.
The translation engine has been significantly improved, and now in most cases it provides more or less the correct translation, but it still needs to be careful that they can still get all the meanings wrong.
