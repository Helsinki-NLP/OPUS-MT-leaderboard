Last week, there was a temporary suspension of the old play "The Beauty Private Rooms" which unexpectedly triggered a live discussion about the national production ratings.
Civil rights groups issued a travel warning for Missouri.
As a result of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, NAACP issued a travel warning to colored people preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which entered into force on 28 August 2017, called for the utmost care and caution when all African American travellers, tourists and Missouris travel in Missouri in response to the recent series of suspicious ethnic incidents in Missouri, and hereby informed that the group's statement stated that it was a matter of great caution.
NAACP noted that the recent adoption of a law in Missouri makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination suits and that law enforcement in the state has to some extent targeted minority groups, which has prompted the organization to issue travel advisories.
The violation of citizens' rights is happening to people.
They were questioned, beaten or killed because of their skin colour. "Rod Chapel, President of NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
"We have received many complaints in an unprecedented number. "
This was the first such warning issued by the organization in the United States against a state.
The organization cited racial defamation of black students at Missouri University and the death of a 28-year-old black male, Toli Sanders.
Earlier this year, Saunders died under suspicious circumstances.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri states that "black drivers in the state are 75% more likely than whites to be checked for parking."
Chapel said, "The purpose of this consultation is to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri."
"People need to be prepared, either to take bail to Missouri or to let relatives know they're traveling in the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime report program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the number of crimes, the state ranks 16th in the country.
Travel warnings are also a response to the new law in Missouri, which will make it more difficult to prosecute enterprises that discriminate against housing or employment.
Previously, the U.S. states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration violators, and the U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicated that this would increase the number of racial prosecutions and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have adopted this approach in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
After the "Golden Age" of the 2015 surge, the overall film market entered a calm period in 2016, and the achievement of a total of $44,669 billion last year became a suspense.
According to the data published by the National Statistical Office, the prices of new and second-hand houses in Beijing went down in October, rising by only 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent.
Lupescu, who is currently the Chief Technical Officer of UEFA, presented a technical report on the 2016 EU Championship and the last European Championship at the Congress.
The BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: to make the foreigners feel "living in a new age."
On January 18th, the media reported that Beijing may have a 3,000-year-old history, but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern charisma city.
This capital of China, with an alarmingly high Internet, sophisticated technology such as face recognition software, a huge investment in artificial intelligence and unparalleled international energy, is one of the most exciting cities for exploration-rich foreigners.
According to the BBC website, on January 16, German expatriate Clemens Sess said, "If I can succeed there, I can do it anywhere in the future." He quotes the singer Frank Sinatra to celebrate New York City.
Sessy, who is the creative director of the Traveler's Archives magazine, says, "If Sinatra survives to this day, he'll probably sing cities like Beijing." "He says living in this city makes you feel like living in a new era, always keeping up with the tide.
But recently Simon Norton, who lives in Beijing, wrote on the personal blog site 4Corners7Seas, saying, "There's an overall feeling that people are at the centre of something huge, which is hard to say, but it leaves many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it's like and want to see for themselves. "
According to reports, high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environments in this city make daily life easier than ever before.
From Manila, Andy Peña Fuerte, currently Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Beijing Children's website, said: "Beijing is rapidly becoming a cashless society, and the Internet has integrated the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions. "
According to the report, smartphones are only the beginning of Beijing's technological ambition, and facial recognition software is widely available, and many mobile phone applications use this technology for bank transfers and payments, allowing people to enter apartments and offices, and even to verify the identity of the drivers of the bikes.
Beijing has also recently announced plans to build an artificial smart technology park at a cost of RMB 13.8 billion, where more than 400 businesses will be located and will focus on developing various artificial intelligence technologies, from biometrics to auto-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of China's many major festivals throughout the years, and participation in these celebrations has been praised by foreigners. Spring Festival is the most important social and economic holiday and one of the most accessible for foreigners.
"I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, cleaning their apartments and putting on their doors a red Spring Union with a New Year ' s blessing. On New Year ' s Eve, all family members will have a great meal together, and then stay up till midnight and greet the New Year with a beautiful fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity to integrate."
According to the report, while the number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, the language barrier in China and the ease of communication among the diaspora can easily be an excuse for their incomplete integration into local culture.
Sessy said, "Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but have little experience with their host countries. If your initial attempts to contact the Chinese are not successful, then it is easy or easier for you to get along with other foreigners.
"In these so-called "exile bubbles" ("exile bubbles" means foreigners who only mix with foreigners without touching local people and local culture - translation note), foreigners entangle in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only foreigners among friends.
The simplest way to overcome this is to learn a bit of Mandarin -- it's easier than one might imagine.
Sessie said, "The Chinese private lesson of one or two hours a week or the first-class radio show should fit everyone's busy schedule."
Even a few classic short sentences would help with shopping, ordering meals in restaurants or chatting in taxis.
It is reported that persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, although in recent years the Government has tried to contain some problems.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities in warm months, where pollution tends to be light, and of using the blue days as an opportunity to swung in a long-standing alley or to explore popular temple parks.
Norton said, "Beijing is the city of China where the most things can be found below the surface, where you can find great artistic and musical activities, night life, historical wonders, super-modern commercial zones and ancient homies."
According to the report, the obstacles to the growth of human capital are becoming increasingly apparent, especially in the north-east, where the average annual contribution of ageing to the growth of human capital is -128 per cent.
Pan Kung-sung noted that the current risk of cross-border capital flows is manageable and that the underlying factors underpinning the balance of payments are still present for a long time.
On December 17, China News Network, Beijing (journalist Takai) launched the International Summit for the Validation and Protection of China's Ancient Paints in Beijing on December 17, 2016.
In April this year, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-load software such as Google Search and Chrome Browser, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The EU Commission considers this to be detrimental to consumers and an obstacle to competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27th.
If the anti-monopoly charge is committed, Google faces a maximum of 10 per cent of its global fine, about $7.4 billion.
Google hasn't commented on it yet.
Google is also facing an EU investigation because of its preference for home shopping services in search results.
Zhang Yu Ning's hindsight is real. It's not by chance that he managed to jump from Qing to Qing-O, and his leap is still surprising.
A picture of the legal status of bitcoin around the world.
Abstract: In addition to the price reversals naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the collapse of the current round of digital currency has nothing to do with the "hostile" - regulatory risk.
Viewable maps show that Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude towards bitcoin than the West, that the countries that dominate the world are still watching the legitimacy of digital currency, and that the "black swan risk" remains high.

With China, South Korea, and the European Union and other major markets such as Bitcoin, the global digital currency, headed by Bitcoin, has been bloody since this week, with Bitcoin prices falling by $10,000 a week, the largest single-day drop in three years.
In addition to the price reversals naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the sharp fall in the current round of digital currency has nothing to do with the long-standing "hostile" - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, PowerMuch.net, a visualized big data site, produced a map showing the legitimacy and level of regulation of bitcoin in countries around the globe.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legitimate market for bitcoin; orange represents the neutral market, which has not publicly legalized its status, but has no major use restrictions; light pink represents the restricted market, where local governments try to use the digital currency through red-line policies or regulation; dark pink represents the country where bitcoin is defined as illegal; grey is the country that has not yet been evaluated.
(The above figure is from the HowMuch.Net visualization team's mapping on January 15th.)
According to the article, as can be seen from the distribution of the green pieces in Central Africa, the traditional Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude towards bitcoin than the West.
Russia is currently the largest country to define bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for bitcoin, India is one of the largest countries to have no comment on the bitcoin, and no policy has yet been put in place.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bitcoin, i.e. the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America in the form of bitcoin are clearly divided, and the distribution of colours in these regions is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are legitimate bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, etc. have some restrictions on their trade and use, and more Latin American countries have yet to speak out about bitcoin.
As can be seen from the synthesis of the above data, 99 countries (or 40 per cent) of the 246 countries surveyed globally have no restrictions on trade in and use of bitcoin, i.e. green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) are restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4 per cent) define bitcoin as illegal (deep pink), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) do not have more treatment for digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that the countries that make up the global majority (53 per cent, more than half) are still watching the domestic legitimacy of the digital currency headed by Bitcoin, and that the "blackswan risk" of Bitcoin remains high, as some of these countries may eventually make legislative decisions to limit the digital currency.
According to the article, global regulators do not fully understand the emerging category of digital currency, which may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a declaration.
Although Bitcoin's "human spirit" has grown exponentially since last year, it does not represent the interest of all countries, perhaps some countries are concerned that local French currency is being threatened or that digital currency is being used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news on Bitcoin since last week, including China's start to strike off off the off-site exchange's centralized services online platform and mobile App. South Korea is still considering closing down the digital currency exchange, and the European Union believes that Bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of losing their blood.
Wall Street editor-in-chief's selection of "Study 2018: Global Guangdong Starts the Year of Digital Currency" mentioned that 2018 will be the Year of Digital Currency of the Global Central Bank from the point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticism, either way.
Russia's big countries criticized the legitimacy of bitcoin, in fact to give way to official digital currency.
On January 8th in Madrid, Xinhua wired Barcelona's new aid to Coutinio 8 in Nokanpo in his first dress in a Bassa ball coat.
Kutiño passed his medical examination in Bassa that morning and signed a contract with Basa Chairman Batomeu to expire in the summer of 2023.
And then, as a Bassa player, he appeared in front of nearly 7,000 fans in Nokamp.
According to the Spanish media, the sum of Cutiño's transfer fees, or Euro160 million (EUR 1 = RMB 7.77), is the first price in the history of the Basa Club and the Western Jail.
Because he's still wounded at the moment, he's going to have to rest for almost 20 days before he can get a virgin show in his pazza suit.
What else is sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most definite sign of regime change was when they started attacking statues.
So Saddam Hussein of Paradise Square in Baghdad in 2003 was deliberately pushed down.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers of the Trump administration, must have known what would happen when Jim Acosta of CNN had a heated debate about the President's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
If he does, then a bunch of cruise ship owners and liberal followers will eat him alive.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was carved on the throne in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller rebukes Acosta: "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to light up the world..."
The poem you're referring to, which was added later, not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
In fact, Miller was right, but, as he said, it's not really about history.
It's about the modern echo of Lazarus' horrifying speech, and the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowd of people who want to breathe freely, / People who suffer reject your crowded beaches."
There's no "suffering people refuse" at a time when our screens are getting sharper.
Miller was not a literary critic, and he made it clear that these people would not be welcome in the Trump-era America.
This conflict over statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends, whose poems were engraved in the base after her death, are well aware of the highly political nature of the acts they are participating in.
The object of this sculpture is to express the link between French and American republicanism through the ancient classic metaphors of the woman as the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the image of a woman is no longer abstract, she has to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
This poem was combined with this painting as a successful feminist coup d'état and a devastating blow to American nativeism.
Just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers always wanted to change it back.
The great speaker Rush Limbaugh, a temporary baptist of Trump, in 2010 believed that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and that he was now an early neo-conservative, bringing America's wisdom to a world of ignorance: "The goddess of freedom is a brave one.
She meant to bring the torch of freedom from America to the rest of the world.
The torch does not light America ' s path. "
It's unusual that Limbo was actually moved by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive angle.
When tired, poor but hopeful people go through a long and often terrible journey, they can see it on the boat deck.
On the face of it, it involves looking at the world from the perspective of those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them and needs the hope and welcome they hear.
Of course, that's not what Miller and Trump wanted to admit.
Their torches are not meant to light the path, but rather to ignite the hatred of their only source of strength.
In 2006, the Zatop became the first Chinese to sign a contract with the British headquarters of Globe with a unique musical style.
2017 World Championship: Neil Black highly praises Scottish members of the British National Team.
Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scots on the British National Team.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the British Association of Fields and Fields, said that a team of 16 strong Scotsmen in the World Championship team would make a huge contribution to the National Team.
The largest number of Scottish field athletes ever selected for the London track championship in 2017, which opened on Friday.
Black thinks "Scotland is making extraordinary progress" from which British trackers have to learn.
" We accept and try to understand this, and we will persevere until we succeed " , said Blake.
"I'm talking to the staff of the Scottish Sports Academy... who think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish trackers think it's about what they're doing.
The British Association of Fields and Fields thinks it has something to do with what they're doing.
Even the street people think so.
Whatever it is, it's brilliant. "
A number of Scottish trackers, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, will be at 5,000 meters higher than Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle will be chosen as the team leader.
"Elid's a little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible." Blake said.
"Many trackers, whether or not they're Scottish, or wherever they live or train, walk out of the door with pride and energy.
Irid's natural passion and true feelings are good. "
The winner of the Commonwealth silver medal, who will compete in the 400-metre race in his 5th World Championship, says that 16 Scottishs on the British National Team are "unbelievable."
Previously, the number of Scottish track and track players in the World Series was up to seven, i.e. the number of contestants obtained in 1983 and 2015.
The runner, Muir, is a leading soldier, and she's got five British records and two European records over the past year.
She's going to be in a 1,500-metre and 5,000-metre competition.
Chris O'Hare, who was in the 1500-metre project, was another interesting Scottish player, who had a good run in the season, winning the pre-elections and the Olympic anniversarys in the United Kingdom.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championship when the only other Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was very proud that so many of her compatriots had joined the team, but in some cases they would also challenge the medals and race to the finals.
"The special thing about being a captain of the national team is that it was chosen by the vote of the other members of the national team, so it's a great honour to know that your teammates voted for you for an extraordinary achievement, which, in any case, was a great honor for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots.
It's just an indication of how far we've gone.
And they're all old trackers here, trackers who're about to march to the stage for the purpose.
How's my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's great.
I was just referring to the fact that, in this case, we're very lucky because we're holding a World Championship on the premises.
That's why it's really important for us to rely on home-based support and to grow up as we return to the Olympic Stadium.
I will be given a second chance to compete, and the atmosphere there will be incredible ... "
In 2016, China had 180,000 employees and 12,180,000 employees, an increase of 21 per cent over the previous year.
On Facebook, block critics: if you can't stand the voters' blame, don't run for office.
Our father knows bad media.
American people love Washington, but soon the big newspapers started slamming at him, from domestic policy to political principles.
He's pissed at these criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn't silence the critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech is denied -- we will be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance."
That reminds me of Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 posts because they made their point on his Facebook official home page.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff thought the lawsuit was too hasty and online coverage was full of their strong resistance: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
That's particularly important, because it's people like Hogan.
He's a Republican governor in a democratic majority state and he's surprisingly popular.
Of the country's 50 governors, he's second in line.
Hogan's not a reactionary impatient.
He's in charge of Maryland. He's in strict compliance with the rules.
He's also very good at Facebook as the main way to reach out to the electorate, showing his bald as a chemical for the first time on the home page.
So it's completely unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous, to block comments from the governor's home page, which is a public forum, a public administrative platform that is branded by public tax-supporting employees.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Shass, defended the governor's behavior by saying that she believed that blocking their comments was just a way to restrain them.
But they're too hasty to describe it as a flood beast or a cynic who's raging the network.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with a man who was shielded by Hogan.
They're just ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: they're teachers, small business owners and priests, not flood beasts.
They say their comments are deep, respectful and not dirty.
The priest quoted the words of the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Ramani, lawyer in Boy, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.
She wrote in the news story review of the Washington Post, "I am politely commenting that I am disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news stories.
I also do not like a group of people commenting on the same subject, because they are simply ignored by people who think they are so-called public minds, not citizens of a country of concern ... "
The Governor's staff called the "intense garbage bombing" might seem to the others to be "continue."
The Facebook era made it easy to change a message, to block a critic or to remove a negative comment.
And it's much cleaner than it was in the past, when it was necessary to send staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical statements or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that's what's happening right now, just at the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for squealing on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
Last week there was a landmark ruling in Virginia, that's what this is about.
According to James Cacharys, District Judge of Alexandria, United States, the Chairman of the Lauden County Supervisory Committee blocked voters from her Facebook page in violation of the First Amendment.
The Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin (R), was also visited by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had similar influence.
The number of newspapers has quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, with anonymous letters strongly criticizing his leadership.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous flood beast against him.
People used false names like Yurikla, Valjerus, Belisalu, and Porgius to write to the press to harshly criticize Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington News Online, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his attitude on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, signed with Britain.
But he didn't squeal.
Freedom of expression, political dissent and freedom of speech are the foundations of this country.
And true leaders need to accept that.
There's a little bit of wind and grass in the city that drives people's sensitive nerves.
Restriction of purchases is a hard-barrel in many urban real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jenan introduced a policy of six months ' continuous social security coverage for undergraduate students, with equal access to housing for residents of the local permanent household;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that provides for university graduates to be admitted on the basis of a graduation and employment certificate within three years.
Then the policy was added, and the official statement was, "A university student can buy a house at a price below 20 per cent of the market price";
In July, Chengdu introduced the requirement that young people with undergraduate degrees and above at a field university can apply for a diploma to settle in the capital city.
In addition to this, cities or regions such as Quinshan and Shanghai Port have introduced a "brain introduction" policy that lowers the threshold for talent-buying households.
In Zhang's view, this is in fact the competition of the big cities for the population, especially the talent, and the ability to retain it, and the competitiveness of cities, which is the most important aspect of these real estate policies.
Some even think it means that the time has come to cancel the city's "restricted" purchase.

The Helensburger said, "The homecoming competition will always have more meaning,
You want to be good; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed being able to play again, and I've been playing golf.
I'm satisfied with the current situation. "
The three-member team was joined by former Masters Winner Ian Woosnan and Changqing champion Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNuggets.

In August, the Director General of the Environmental Inspectorate of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Zou Zhou Zhumin, introduced a total of 57 cases of daily and continuous punishment throughout the country. The new revision of the Environmental Protection Act, introduced earlier this year, significantly increased China's environmental law enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection agencies in all parts of China can investigate and punish environmental violations by means of daily and consecutive penalties, seizure, cut-off and administrative detention, and cooperate with the judicial authorities in the punishment of environmental crimes.
In August, a total of 335 cases were seized in various parts of China; 177 cases were closed; 189 cases of administrative detention and 166 cases of alleged environmental pollution offences were transferred.
Of these, Henan is carrying out seven consecutive daily punishments, and China is currently embedding from end-of-pipe control to full-scale environmental pollution management.
Despite the downward pressure of the economy, China's Ministry of Environmental Protection has made it clear that China should properly position environmental protection in the context of economic development, so as to enhance the "green force" and the faster the economy goes down, the less it will be able to relax environmental protection and optimize its impact on the economy.

Zhejiang province has promoted the spirit of the Red Ship with determination and determination to keep its work at the forefront of the times.
As soon as the new water samples were collected, Liu Rie and his colleagues were busy.
While monitoring on a daily basis,
This year, they're working on the intellectual management of rural sewage.
How to manage it is actually a very serious challenge.
Zhejiang Qinghua Triangular Institute for Eco-Environmental Research is located at the birthplace of the Red Ship Spirit.
From nothing ten years ago to now.
The Zhejiang Zhenghua Triangular Institute has developed into three national priority innovation platforms, with nearly 400 students from overseas living in Zhejiang.
Red ship spirit is a force that we have to follow and understand. Innovation is hard.
Every innovation in this.
You have to hold on at that stage, and you're going on and on.
It's the people who came to the house. They're coming up and down. So...
Do things for the people.
In this way, as of now, 5 985 questions have been collected, of which 3,868 have been resolved, and 1,496 are being dealt with.
Zhejiang's cadre has one thing to say.
The strength of geography is less than that of the cadre, the policy preference is less than the quality of service, and the red ship spirit of dedication is an incentive for us to move forward and to be in the forefront of what we do.
You're brave enough to fight.
In recent days, we have organized a group of 19 leading representatives of the Chinese literary and artistic community and prominent artists to travel to Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Shanghai, Guangdong, Guizhou, etc. to speak about the 19 great spiritualities.
They went to grassroots art galleries, local courtyards and some higher education institutions in Inner Mongolia, Heilong River, Gansu, etc., with a new cultural mission to the 19 leading spiritual Chinese artists.
I'm proud and happy, and I'm willing to go down and down and write more about the fate of the big people.
What good ideas can we have for this grass-roots arts development?
There's a little bit of popularism going on.
It's a time-defeating work.
It's supposed to be deep roots and grass roots, and then it's supposed to be something that's culturally thick, positive, and persistent artistic charm.
Twenty-eight, with an area of 1.520 billion acres actually measured, of which 1.110 million were completed.
The seven provinces of Sichuan and other provinces, which account for 82 per cent of the land under contract for two rounds of households, have reported to the Party's Central State Council that it is almost complete.
It is expected that by the end of 1808, national contracting authority will be largely completed
In the future, the Ministry of Agriculture will explore the outcome of this process.
The first star in our space science satellite series is also the first dark matter particle detection satellite in the world.
In orbit for almost two years, four scans of the whole sky zone have been conducted and over 3.5 billion high-energy particles have been detected, resulting in the most accurate in the world.
The results were published in the international academic journal Nature.
In space, we've seen a new one that has not been observed before.
The significance of this research is multiple, and the most important is that it shows that Chinese scientists use the most advanced technologies.
The ability to create scientific instruments to detect a very difficult scientific problem.
It's the last century, a lot of people remembering the toilets in China.
It's been integrated into more and more human design.
A lot of tourists are impressed. The toilets are always ventilated. They don't smell like shit.
You don't have to look at the toilet by your nose anymore.
Not just to change the hardware, but to keep up with the software.
The tourism sector requires toilet paper and handwashing.
But in some areas,
Is it because of the uncivility of the individual to stop this service?
Local managers have made their choice.
On the one hand, the promotion of savings through civilisation, and on the other hand, technological innovation.
It's a public toilet in Jiangsu Nanjing, Cebu and so on.
Three seconds to brush your face and get a free toilet paper, but if you want a double copy, you'll have to wait another ten minutes.
Avoiding misuse of public resources
It's a habit that some tourists might actually want to put the paper back, but on the other hand, we have to think about it.
Is there no paper in the next toilet we're going to enter, so that's what we've been focusing on in the new three-year plan.
We're going to have to fix this imbalance.
To push the toilet revolution deeper, it's to think more of what the people think.
There must be a third bathroom for the family to accompany the elderly and the children to the bathroom.
We brought the baby, and the men's room we were embarrassed to go in.
The little girls in the bathroom are as young as they know how to be embarrassed. The tablet is so comfortable. It's easy for us to take the kids.
In the countryside, the villagers of the Guangxi River pool are building new flush toilets in their homes.
Much has been achieved by actively promoting the toilet revolution, which not only helps people to stay away from disease, but also leads to economic development that narrows the regional development gap.
This toilet problem is a big problem. It's a social development node.
It's a national civilizational project that leads to the layout from a national perspective, and then involves all sides to varying degrees in solving minor social problems.
That's all we've got.
With the construction of the Jinxi irrigation project in Heilongjiang, 14 major new water projects have been launched this year.

At noon today, at the Liquor Spring Satellite Launch Centre, we successfully launched the Land Survey Satellite-1 into its scheduled orbit with the Long March 2 Ting launch vehicle.
Construction began before the first tunnel of the Yellow River.
The tunnel is three and seven kilometers long, and when it's completed, it's going down the Yellow River to connect directly to the main town of Tonji South.
Spiritual.

He has repeatedly expressed his opposition to the German government's acceptance of immigrants and even to the right-hand rhetoric that Germany should be proud of the war veterans of World War II.
A large crowd of locals gathered outside the rally to protest against the party’s extreme right-wing populist claims.
In the German Bundestag election in September this year, the party was elected the third largest party in the House.

Poverty and death in Indonesia.
Baddine Djay doesn't use stoves when she cooks.
She doesn't even use a pot.
Her cabin is located in Enarotali, the capital of Pania County, Papua, Indonesia, where the housewife usually simply puts a sweet potato, which the locals call "nota", directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the charred potatoes were taken by a pair of unwashed hands and eaten in a corset.
Djay sits on the mud -- she doesn't have any furniture, and this is where she does routine household chores, such as washing clothes, washing clothes, and the water is so dazzling, it's all coming from the nearby marshlands.
There's a bucket in a room without a roof. It's an outdoor toilet.
She's the youngest of the four wives of her husband, so she's not assigned to the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it's dangerous to work late: most of the men in the village are not working, and many are drunk, and there's a lot of soldiers here.
She said, "No one dares to walk in the village after 5:00 in the afternoon."
This is a rare glimpse of daily life in the Papua Heights, once a colony of the Netherlands, which was incorporated into Indonesia in the 1969 referendum, but which was also controversial, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the occupying army.
There is a strong demand for independence, and the campaign against Dutch rule soon turned its back on the Jakarta government, which has imposed a high-handed rule on the region, isolating foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided between Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali's location is remote and deserted; it takes 90 minutes to get here from Chayapura, capital of the province, to get to Nabire, and then rent a car for five hours, all the way down the river.
There's no public transport here.
In this town, about 19,000 people, the wooden huts are surrounded by bamboo fences, wrinkled iron roofs are all kinds of brown shades made of rust.
Few Indonesians come in, not to mention journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here.
Djay says, "We're not used to these clothes." She means her colorful turban, her dark shirt and her beautiful half-dress.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves. "
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and has the highest infant mortality rate and lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also Indonesia's Golden Land.
Paniay County is high, about the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Glassberg, is only 60 miles from here, owned by Philip McMoran Copper Company, based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources, estimated at $78 billion.
But these vast resources are also the source of the Papuan tragedy, and that is why Indonesia's powerful military forces have been able to suppress them.
According to a 2005 New York Times report, Philips paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for an official alone.
Papuans' claims to independence have grown stronger, threatening the gold lord, and they have been subjected to cruel treatment.
According to human rights defenders, more than half a million Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in the Papua highlands in the 1970s escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Brisbane Parish "We're going to lose everything" encompassed evidence of the most heinous acts of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — another reported particularly widespread rape and electrocution — and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
According to Andréas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch, " violent incidents occur on a daily basis, making it difficult to calculate the number of victims ... "
Papua's resources brought in large numbers of immigrants outside Indonesia, and the oppression began.
Eighty-three per cent of the province's 3.5 million people are Christians, but the demographic structure of Muslim economic migrants has changed since they arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javan snack stand sells fried chicken and vegetables mixed with peanut butter.
The locals fought hard.
24-year-old Paniai native Apos Ju moved to Chayapura, capital of the province, where he explained, "The immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans.
This has caused the local Papuans, the mama-mama, to lose their market. "
Indonesian President Zoko Widodo, often known as Zokovi, vowed to address the issue of inequality and abuse of power in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The former carpenter's road to Jakarta's presidential palace was supported by 27 out of 29 districts, including Pania.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
Says, "We've broken our hearts, and in 2014 we voted for Zokovi, hoping that he will fulfill our wishes and restore justice."
In fact, only two months after Zokovi took office in October, Pania had the worst nightmare ever.
On December 7, 2014, the children of Enarotali 11 sang a Christmas hymn in front of the bonfire, and two Indonesian soldiers came over on their motorcycles.
The scared kids told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local priest, Yavet Tebbai, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses claim that these drunk soldiers used their guns to chase these kids.
And then one of the soldiers shot these kids.
16-year-old Julianus Yemmer was unconscious because of his severe beating.
A few hours later, a fire broke out in the nearby government agency Election Commission building, and the next day the incident escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They danced the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe in Papua with their ceremonial hunting bows -- running around in circles and imitating birds.
Some protesters started throwing stones at regular military posts.
According to an official document read in Time magazine, when emotions continue to intensify, soldiers receive orders from their internal radios: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately." But the document was not released to the local media.
The 56-year-old Jeremias Kayamu, the head of the Enarotali Kego Koto neighbourhood, felt threatened, called for calm and begged them to come home.
But nobody's in the mood to hear him say it.
He stood on the porch of his colorful cabin and told Time magazine that when I turned back, my left wrist was shot. "
Kayamura still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he says the bullet came from among the soldiers gathered.
And he said, "It was crowded, they fired a lot of shots."
According to the cousin of the local Olfius Juul, he witnessed the shooting and saw Olfius Juul be shot three times.
Yuhanes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if it wasn't him,
I found him dead and I kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of Papua Police, Yuji Mende, told reporters that his subordinates were only at the "protect" police station because the police station was attacked.
In 2015, the police spokesman for Papua, Puggio Solistiaux, said, "We have to defend ourselves when someone threatens to kill us.
It's a matter of life and death. "
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The next day's news of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi gave a passionate speech in Jayapula, expressing deep sympathy to the families of the victims and vowing to address the legacy of the abuse of power in Papuan history.
He said, "I hope this case is resolved as soon as possible so that it will not happen again in the future."
In October 2016, Minister of Security Verando stated that he would set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuses for pushing off are almost instantaneous.
He said, "Most of the violations took place a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and the early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but this requires a process ... "
Then on June 5th, in Jakarta, Vilando turned his back on his conversation with Time magazine and said he had no plans to establish a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be resolved by law."
The United Nations had filed a complaint against Vilando for "crimes against human rights" in the 1999 bloody independence vote in East Timor, but he said that 11 human rights violations had been resolved in the Papua area, including the Pania incident.
The families of the Pania victims were snuffed with these statements.
Juhanes said, "In the last three years, I've had four interviews, but nothing's going on."
Years later, he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army. I'm afraid of being shot. "
His brother Yukabus also thought that the Pania people were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
He said, "After burying the body, the military came to me."
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Deyay County, Paniae Neighborhood.
The manager of a construction company refused to help transport a unconscious man to the hospital, and a clash took place between the two sides, killing one and injuring 17 others, including children.
Twenty-four-year-old Lavynus Dowwood drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so they fired warning shots.
But the rioting mobile forces (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd, and one man was killed.
29-year-old Dominique Buddy told Time magazine, "We were panicking and now afraid they'd retaliate. " He lived near the hospital and saw the wounded rush into the hospital.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deyay Parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the rioting mobile forces to be withdrawn from the area.
Pania has always been a good place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development breeds discontent among the peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered in the central highlands of Panee.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army claiming to protect the rights of Papuans through scattered attacks and raids to abduct Indonesian soldiers.
Part of the senior leadership of the Free Papua Movement was born in Pania, including Tadius Yuji and Daniel Yudas Kocoa.
As a result, thousands of Paniae have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military in recent years under the guise of "maintaining national sovereignty".
Some people never show up again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Pania is a place of forgotten tragedy.
Poverty breeds discontent.
Ainarotali's selling so little rice that the locals can't afford it.
The bread is out of reach.
The people here grow everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaves and vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five red potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for writers and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten tampons worth 10,000 Indonesian rupees.
Over time, economic inequality has spread among local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of the new route to the airport in Nabire.
The few jobs available are usually in the hands of better educated and richer immigrants.
The Papuans have little money or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
The chairman of the Paniai tribal council, John Gobay, said, "Young people don't want to stay in this village because there's no work, no money. "
Papua is isolated.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lonshan were deported from Papua because they "do not cooperate with the authorities" even though they had rare access to film authorization.
According to the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Félim Kane, the electoral vow of Zokovi to lift the reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been fulfilled.
In a statement, he said, " Foreign journalists are at new risk if they try to cover Papua and West Papua, the most disaffected provinces of Indonesia in the easternmost part of the country: denial of visas and blacklisting. "
The absence of media monitoring means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to neighboring Papuans.
In March, six Pacific countries — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's “all kinds of widespread human rights violations”, including the Pania shooting.
These countries also supported the Free Papua movement.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Armanata Nasir, who had no interest in the group ' s allegations, told the journalists in Jakarta that " Indonesia is still democratic and free of the media, so it is difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations " .
Locals want more attention from foreign governments.
According to an informed source, on May 4, when the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Keith Van Bar, led a delegation of officials to Jayapula, the local people broke their silence and cried "We want freedom." He also attended the meeting, but demanded anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Zokovi again.
The chairman of the tribal council, Gobai, said, "Zokovi's intentions are good, but he's surrounded by people involved in the Paniae shooting."
He wanted Zokovi to know that the Pania people lived not only under the threat of a greedy army, but also with nothing, little education in the region and little public health care.
Gobai says the Pania people, like the rest of Papuans, believe that their vote for Zokovi is a debt he must pay.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniay shooting made their last symbolic protest: burying a victim's body across the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let the culprits forget their crimes.
Yukabous bowed his head and said, "My family was killed.
What else can we do?"
On February 10, 2017, the CSRC approved the initial application of Guangdong Home & Home Co. Ltd. to issue a small card for the sale of small boards in a deep place, after more than 20 days of IPO adoption.
The industry believes that, with the introduction of the European family home, which is already in the wind, the area of custom home ownership will shift from product competition to capital competition.
At the beginning of the New Year's approval, the news that a typical branded house of representation in the home is about to come on the market attracts the attention of the whole home industry.
According to Reuters, 9 Beijing time, Samsung Electronics released a first set of auto-driving components developed on Tuesday with Harman International, as well as an information entertainment solution, which is an important move for the company to enter the electronic market for military vehicles.
Three Star Electronics acquired Haman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Exhibition (CES) in Las Vegas this week, Samsung issued a collision warning, a traffic deflection warning, a cruise control car camera, which was developed in cooperation with Haman.
Samsung plans to launch this camera system this year, which is built on automatic machine learning and the expansion of reality.
The three stars also show the "digital cockpit" that even if the driver is not the owner of the car, it can make the vehicle more personal, because the system allows users to download the driver's data from mobile devices and clouds.

The fire devoured the tower of Dubai's Torch.
Friday, a fire broke out in the highest residential building in the world, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the high 337-metre, 79-storey superstructure.
It was the second fire in just two years that swept the high-rise building, and it happened to be the skyscraper known as the torch.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and the cause of the fire has not yet been identified.
"We were sleeping, and then we woke up by fire and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs, from the 50 floors, for about 10 minutes, "A resident named George told Reuters.
The civil defence authorities in Dubai claim that the fire brigade put out the fire at around 4 a.m. local time, and is in the process of cooling the building.
The Government has indicated that efforts are being made to provide safe havens for affected persons.
The accident may cause renewed worldwide attention to the safety of outer-wall materials in high-rise buildings.
In a survey conducted by the skyscrapers management in the aftermath of their 2015 fire, most of the damaged objects were decorated and insulated overlay walls.
The British police have indicated that they believe that the problem with the insulation and overlay panel system at the Glenfield Building in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire, which caused the death of about 80 people.
Williams' convoy also suggested that Massa might return, even though he had announced his retirement.
On January 9th, only a month before the opening of the Korean Olympic Games in Pingchang, the winter atmosphere in Korea has grown stronger with the transmission of heat and preparations from the south to north of the Olympic holy fire.
South Korean public opinion expects this long-defeated inter-Korean talks to bring an egg to Ping Chang Dong's countdown for a month.
On November 1st of last year, Ping Chang Dong's Holy Fire arrived in Korea.
The heat of the holy fire is directly reflected in the sale of tickets to the Pingchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, Ping Chang Dong's ticket sales rate stood at 32 per cent, and the Winter Paralympic's ticket sales rate was only 4.3 per cent, and the low ticket sales rate had once caused the world to worry about Ping Chang's audience.
But as Lee Hee-fan, Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Ping Chang Winter Olympic Games, predicted to the journalists recently, "The heat of the Olympic Games is rising as they pass through South Korea, and it is believed that the sales of tickets will soon improve."
According to Korean media reports, as of 3 January, the Pichang Winter Olympics ticket sales had reached 64 per cent, and the Winter Paralympics ticket sales rate had exceeded 50 per cent.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to the Korean Games, the Korean Ministry of Justice announced on the 8th day that it would extend the stay of foreigners visiting the Ping Chang Olympic Games to a maximum of 120 days.
The investigation found that more than one fifth of American travellers boarded the plane with prohibited items.
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had deliberately or inadvertently carried illegal items through the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority checkpoint, and at least 6 per cent of those passengers had intentionally boarded the aircraft with prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1% of the passengers claimed that they only later discovered that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
This investigation, which targeted over 1,000 people, was carried out by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters Inc., and found that young travellers are more likely to blatantly ignore regulations.
19.7 per cent of respondents who admitted that they had attempted to board with TSA prohibited items were from the Millennium generation, compared to less than 15 per cent in the X generation.
The most common items that deliberately slip past TSA security officers are food and beverages.
More than 3% of the respondents admitted having intentionally carried a blade through the security check, and 2.2% of the female respondents and 3.7% of the male respondents indicated having deliberately carried prohibited drugs on board.
According to the company, the purpose of the investigation was to find out the number of people who had accidentally carried and deliberately carried embargoed goods on board the plane.
It's not surprising that the most likely person to have carried embargoed items past security control — either intentionally or by accident — is the person who flies most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA Guide is a little complicated to understand.
People don't usually know what kind of liquid they can carry and how much.
It's not surprising, therefore, that TSA has the most seizures of illegal liquids.
There was a time when people thought that TSA might have used books as embargoed.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry.
U.S. EPA Director Prout changed his mind about the Obama-era mitigation regulations.
One day after being sued by 15 states, the Environmental Protection Director, Scott Prout, changed his earlier decision to postpone implementation of the Obama-era air pollution reduction regulations.
Prout proposed this change because the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state environmental regulators than the previous government.
He didn't mention the legal challenges that the Federal Court of Appeal had brought against his predecessor.
The debate focused on setting October 1st as the deadline for states to start meeting the 2015 terrestrial ozone standards.
In June, Prute announced that he would delay compliance for one year, in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid "disturbing local decision-making or impeding economic growth".
Prior to being appointed by President Donald Trump, Prout was the Attorney General of Oklahoma, who had long opposed the strictisation of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Prout has repeatedly turned to laws and regulations that prevent or delay opposition in the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is one of the most recent legal obstacles to Prout's re-entry.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Director of Environmental Protection had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and reduce methane spills.
In a statement released on Wednesday night, Prouts presented a major shift in his attitude towards ozone standards, expressing his commitment to strengthening the Environmental Protection Agency and working with the states to implement complex procedures to reach new standards.
According to Prute, " under the former government administration, EPA usually falls short of the prescribed deadline and then waits for radical groups and others to sue and agree to set the specified timetable by agreement. " He initiated dozens of prosecutions against EPA in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, we take deadlines seriously.
We take the regulations and the authorities seriously. "
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Prout may again use his "extended authorization and all other legally available authorization" to ensure that the provisions are "good policy and best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wide rewriting of the ozone layer regulations.
The House Bill approved last month was designed to delay the 2015 rule for at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney Eric Schneiderman led the state coalition this week to sue the US EPA for intent to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman says, "The reverse of the US EPA -- after we have filed a lawsuit -- is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke. "
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and Washington, D.C., joined the New York state in this case.
Ground-based ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants from cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke causes serious respiratory problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists hailed the amazing transformation of Plut.
According to Lori Ann Byrd of the Biodiversity Centre: " It is disturbing that this common sense measure has come under tremendous pressure from the heads of the departments that protect the air we need to breathe. "
" We must fight the Trump government ' s ideological campaign to cater to polluters and special interest groups ... "

The Deputy Director of the Xiaoshan Forest Administration, Shi Haeyong, said that, with the good marketing situation, the production of Xiaoshan flowers had grown more rapidly.
In the last two years, the area planted by Bain Shan Hanwood has been expanded by 30,000 acres to a total area of 180,000 acres, while active out-of-area development has been accompanied by the establishment of 80,000 acres of wood base by Xiaoshan Mau farmers throughout the country, an increase of 30,000 acres over 2008.
The expansion of the area under cultivation has been accompanied by a steady improvement in the quality of the trees, increasing value of nursery stock, large specifications, higher-quality stocking of the trees, and the sale of some of the trees.
Shihyong also reminds producers that, in the face of the current boom, producers need to face up calmly and objectively to see both the long-term and growing demand for flowers in society and the increased competition in the market.
On the morning of July 13, Beijing time, the United States company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the Eastern Texas District Court, alleging that Apple had violated a battery technology patent it had applied for in 2010.
The company has been sued on the same patent before, I think, Samsung, Sony and Toshie.
The suit alleges that the iPhone 6s and similar apple equipment both violated United States patent No. 7,657,386 entitled "Integrated Battery Service System".
The plaintiff wished to receive cash compensation or to charge a patent fee for tort equipment after the judgement was pronounced.
From the indictment, it appears that the plaintiff argued that the iPhone ' s fast-fill function violated the company ' s patent ...
The iPhone with a fast charge will quickly charge up to 80% and then recharacterize.
Somaltus is actually a so-called patented hooligan because the company doesn't offer obvious products and services and it's hard to find the information online.
However, they have successfully settled the patent with automobile manufacturers such as Ford and Japanese.
The meeting recognized the importance of accelerating the development of information, promoting the interconnection of resources, making efficient use of them, increasing the digitalization and intellectualization of industries, promoting "China's manufacturing 2025" and popular entrepreneurship, creating innovation, nurturing new dynamics and improving the quality of life of the population.

According to leaked phone records, Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall at the border.
The Washington Post leaked records of a conversation between President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a call to the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
It was reported that the President of the United States had expressed dissatisfaction with his public criticism of the wall, and that he had allegedly told him: "Don't tell the media. "
During the presidential campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
His phone records with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, which showed a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. assumed the refugee repatriation deal to Australia was "puzzling," "obnoxious" and "stupid" and that he had advised the U.S. to ban resettlement of refugees, and now insisted that the Obama administration brokered the deal, which would make him look like a "wit".
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call today.

The Moor Beach Tragic: A return to racist lynching and justice for activists
A Ford Mercury car in 1948, running through a crowd of viewers in Monroe, Georgia, running towards a small Moor Beach bridge.
The car was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and before it reached the bridge, a group of white men with guns came forward and blocked the way forward.
The leader of these thugs-- a middle-aged man in a striped suit-- taking a deep sip of cigars, staring into the windshield.
The passengers in the car are full of fear.
"We want--Roger!" The man shouted.
"Tow him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged down from the front row passenger seat and screamed into silence.
Fortunately, this terrible scene on July 22 is just a repetition.
But when Roger's neck was covered with a cord, almost all the viewers made a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moor Beach Bridge, where two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Merey Dossy - were hanged in 1946 by the Klan.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, and although we have seen them in the community, it's incredible that none of them have been arrested over the years, and Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize this reoccurrence, said.
"This is the stain of history, the burden of our souls. "
Brooks, 71 years old, was a former Georgia congressman and a rights activist for life.
For him, it was a remarkable call to remind the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice had never been corrected.
"We want to sue, we want to close, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we must first get justice," he said.
"We will not be cured and reconciled unless we have justice. "
On July 27, 1946, the Coroner put a bed sheet on the body of a lynching victim at Moore Beach.
According to FBI files from the National Broadcasting Corporation News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of being involved in lynching.
But none of them have ever been prosecuted.
Although suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists have stated that the dual motive for lynchings is well known throughout the town: politics and sexuality.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens of Georgia to vote in the initial elections for the first time later in the summer.
According to the FBI, at about the same time, the black tenant Roger Malcolm assassinated the white landlord, Bannet Hearst, in a struggle that looked like it was for a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Herst slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and her baby wasn't her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25th, 1946, a prominent white landlord, Roy Harrison, spent $600 bailing Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and cousins McMerry and George Dorsey went to prison with him.
But when they came back from prison to the Moor Beach Bridge, a bunch of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder," an FBI report concluded.
" It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness ... "
Brooks is very brief.
He said, "This is a vote tragedy."
"They were murdered, and the murderer sent a message to the black people of this community: "If you register and vote, you will end up with the same fate."
For almost 10 years, Cassandra Green has been in charge of the annual re-emergence of the Moor Beach Bridge lynching.
She's got a clear image, a heart-blowing, deep racist background, and many people want this racism to cease to exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, it's harder not to look, but Green says that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because it makes us face the ugly faces of everyone," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me, or if you don't hear me tell my story, I can't have a relationship with you. "
This year's show started in June, and on the first day, there were almost 30 actors -- 10 whites, the rest blacks -- sitting in a room, listening to Green's rehearsing show overview.
Wade Malbau was co-director of Green.
He's been playing the Klan for years, but he says it's never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like this," said Malbau.
"But I think it's important to keep this history alive, because we don't want to go back to that era. "
In the room, the actors Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hearst, Darios Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, rehearsed their lines.
At the beginning of the show, Malcolm shouted and pushed Herst away, and he was so angry that he slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my land!"
Rascona backtrack.
And then they got in a fight.
And then everybody laughs.
Green laughs the best.
"What's wrong?" Lascone asked.
He's scared, confused.
Am I overplaying it?
"No," Green smiled.
"I just don't think white people say, "Aah."
"Yes," another black actor playing the playway.
"Your tone must be strong."
So, the energy in the room has changed; the feeling of love has driven away the feeling of discomfort.
Everyone tried to do it not only to perform the play, but also to honour the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona said the word "aah", it was sharp and powerful.
No one's laughing.
Again, it's over with strength and speed.
Scream, gunshots, and then a silence.
A woman in a funeral black dress standing by the actor's body singing Billy Halde's mourning word "unusual fruit".
Her voice overwhelms other words.
A hundred yards away, about 40 viewers are rubbing their sweats and tears.
Blacks and whites make up almost half of the audience.
There's a couple coming to see the show from Ithaca, New York, and a lot of people live near the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm's and Dorothy's graveyards for almost eight hours, and everyone was suffering from Georgia's uncomfortable wet fever.
But now, standing on the same land where the lynching took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer and examine the bodies played by the actors.
The children bowed down, watched fake blood and corpses, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy murmurs like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the crowd and the show's over.
Actors throw away the lynching ropes and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Malbau, the man in the suit who's the leader of the Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his colleagues and weeps in their arms; the emotion of the performance eventually infected him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispered.
"We know that's not what's inside of you.
You're doing this for a reason. "
After that, the audience sat down for dinner with the actors.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted closely with a black couple they just met about re-emerging.
It's hard for Dennis Duplinski to find words to describe what she feels after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those terrible words and behaviors that people like you say and make because they look like you," she said.
"It really made me think that lynching was still going on, and she added, "Now this kind of thing is just a police shooting."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sits at the table watching, tastes and tastes civil rights.
He says he's already planning next year's show.
"Recurrence is an inspiring way to describe the horrors we have experienced, but it is also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, it may happen again.
Those who do not study and who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. "
For natural gas market reform, the importance of reform in the "independent network" is self-evident, but resistance and controversy are also greater.
On 7 July, journalists were informed by Hebei Xuan Group that an explosion had occurred at 11.25 a.m. in the Dairy Group Dairy Factory in Tangshan, Hebei Province, where 13 operators were trapped.
So far, 1 out of 13 persons trapped has been rescued and taken to a hospital, while the remaining 12 are under stress.
It is understood that the scene is under lockdown and that local security, fire, medical, etc. are being rescued at the scene.
According to witnesses, it started with a bang and a mushroom cloud.
According to members of the open-air group that organized the search and rescue on the ground, Tang Shan Chemical Company Ltd. is located in Zhao Zhangbei, in the ancient metallurgical district of Tangshan, Hebei Province, and is a State-sanctioned production company for civilian explosive devices, which was established in 1958 and is formerly known as the Zing Mines Authority ' s 602 plant.

American media: Chinese Air Force Engineering University scientists research laser satellites for space garbage removal
On January 18th, the reference network reported that Chinese scientists had made a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the chaotic Earth orbit and destroy old satellites and their sky litter.
On January 15, according to the newsweek website of the United States, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Space-based laser removal small-scale space debris reorbiting modelling", which describes how space debris can be exposed to less irradiated lasers through the use of space-based platform lasers.
According to the report, space debris has been an issue of concern to the international space agencies for many years, and NASA has considered multiple options to track and detect and remove man-made debris.
The manner in which large-scale space debris is removed includes giant networks used to clean and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit.... Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up Earth's orbit.
The summary of the paper states: " (Simulation) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser technology for space debris removal ... "
A 2014 study by the United States defense giant, Lockheed-Martin, found that there were approximately 200 threats per day for satellites operating in orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth's orbit is considered a serious threat to future space missions and is described by ESA experts as "a lethal chain of threats".
And on January 17th, the American website of the monthly Volkswagen Journal reported that space is basically empty, but it's becoming crowded right next to the Earth, and that every satellite we send into space eventually becomes another piece of debris that orbits the Earth and that over time these fragments will accumulate.
The more debris, the higher the probability that a satellite will be hit by debris, the more it will damage or destroy an investment worth millions of dollars.
Reports say that all space agencies have plans to clean up space debris in the future.
NASA is considering the use of jet gas to reduce the rate of debris from orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large web to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electric chain.
At the moment, China has also proposed a solution to the problem of space debris, which is to use a large laser to crush floating space debris into less harmful pieces.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in the German monthly newspaper Optical, the installation of such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least on the basis of simulations.
The report states that the only way to verify effectiveness is to test and that there are no arrangements for such missions, but that sooner or later someone will install lasers on satellites and send them into space.
Once we do it, we can finally get rid of space trash once and for all.

On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO statements, there was an explosion on Thursday night when a joint Afghan-NATO coalition patrol was attacked by "individual-carrying improvised explosive devices".
According to the statement, all injured persons are currently in stable condition and are being treated at the United States military hospital at Bagram Airbase.
According to press reports, the growing presence of the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh has raised serious concerns about NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, while approximately 20 per cent died in the capital.
A suicide car bomb attack in the predominantly Shia area of Kabul at the end of July killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claimed they had launched the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the centre of Kabul killed more than 150 people, the most deadly attack by armed elements in the country since the overthrow of the Taliban by the United States-led multinational force in 2001.
The violence highlighted the precarious security situation in Afghanistan at a time when US President Donald Trump was balancing the need to increase Afghan troops to support his army and police.
According to journalists, the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the Government and its policies, particularly Ashraf Ghani’s reputation as President.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proceedings overturning the resolution and delaying smoke regulations
In his tenure, Obama made a requirement for states to contain all types of smoke-induced emissions, 15 states to prosecute the United States Environmental Protection Agency for that provision. One day after the indictment, the EPA overturned the regulation.
The US EPA announced on Wednesday its decision to continue the so-called "Ozone Compliance Zone 2015" and committed the EPA to working with the states.
In a statement, US EPA Director Scott Pruit said, " We are confident in dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to them. "
In June, Pruit announced that the EPA planned to postpone the application of the ozone compliance area standards to October 2018 for a period of one year, according to which existing smoke contamination in some areas should be measured to determine which areas should be reduced in order to meet air quality standards.
15 major Democrat states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit on Tuesday claiming that the act was illegal.
As part of the broader agenda, the authorities of President Donald Trump have been working to restore the environmental regulations promoted by former President Barack Obama in order to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts provoked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups who feared that more emissions would affect public health.
The U.S. EPA website claims that breathing ozone-containing air will reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.

McGi García and Vassili Lomachenko met for the first time to discuss a possible future duel.
The most striking 147-pound boxing contest will be held shortly, and Vasily Lomachenko and Mackey Garcia are meeting for the first time on Thursday in a potentially conflict-prone state.
They're in separate rooms at the ESN office in Los Angeles, where the undefeated World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion Garcia took the lead in walking down the corridor and greeted the World Boxing Organization Superfine Champion, Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing on Saturday, the referee unanimously concluded that Garcia had defeated Adrien Brona, the world champion of the four Divisions, so that both fighters had become the top five on the same weight list.
Jasira put out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck. "
On Saturday night, at 7 p.m. in the ESPN competition, Lomachenko won over Miguel Mariaga and preserved his position.
When the two of them took the picture, the manager of Lomachenko, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the potential rivalry between the two players depended on the perfect size.
"I used to be lightweight," Garcia Tide.
"I'm up to fight Brona, but I don't weigh that much.
I'm a little underweight compared to 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he's got to be lightweight, so we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Then we'll satisfy them."
Lomachenko agrees.
"The boxing community needs this fight. "
Some of his strategy was to have Lomachenko compete with a 135-pound player later this year to make a date with Garcia next summer. Garcia is also interested in fighting with Jorge Linares-Luque Campbell after the Lightweight Boxing of the 23rd September Forum.
"Because all the fans are asking the question, this fight may be a second-rate fight," Garcia said.
"We're the main people.
No one else can get so much attention.
As long as they're ready..."
Garcia admires Lomachenko as a great player and probably watching his Saturday boxing match.
But Lomachenko hesitated about Garcia's praise, saying that he thought that this three-division champion from Riverside looked "slow." I'm sorry, McKee, but you're going to be voted out."
Garcia says the point is to show the power of the fist and then the fist.
They're all saying they can feel the momentum of their fights.
"This is the battle that has to be fought,
Attention and heat are beyond the reach of other boxing games.
I'd be happy to be in the race, "Gascia says.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top warriors. It's Mikey's turn.
It'll be a great battle. "
Yesterday, the West Side organized a major environmental volunteering event on the theme "Green Home, Enabling West City"
Unlike the traditional way of picking up garbage and distributing propaganda materials, the organizers have set up six game experience areas, including water-saving toilet displays, enzymes production experiences, traffic dominoes, etc.
At present, many children in the country have given up their studies because of their targeting of professional golfers and are on a smooth career path, let alone college.
The Chinese CDRC officials expressed their view of the early completion of the 11-5 emission reduction target, giving strong expectations for the re-entry of the restricted steel industry.
Although the steel plant has not received a clear notification from the local government that the energy-saving reduction exercise has been completed, industry estimates indicate that on or about 15 December 2010 the steel plant, which was previously limited, will be restarted and the price of the steel may begin to pressurize.
No notice of the end of the electricity cut-off has yet been received, but in fact the pressure on companies is much less than in September, when a private steel company in Hebei province told journalists.
In the northern part of the river, electricity-restricted documents were repeatedly issued and, at one point, companies were restricted in their production through forced locks.
Journalists have learned from local companies that most of the steel plants in Hebei are now back to work and that the pressure on production has been reduced.
Zhang Tieshan, my steel grid analyst, predicts that the end demand for construction steel will gradually shift away from weakness, as the north is already in winter.
Together with the phasing out of energy-efficient emission reductions, most steel plants will be largely restored by December 15th, with products arriving in local markets by New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on the price of steel, which is currently on the right rise.

The 68th Emmy Award ceremony took place yesterday in Los Angeles, USA.
This year's play-the-mart-the-mart-the-mart competition finally beats a bunch of old actors by two newcomers: the Best Actor Award was won by Rami Marek, the first named hackers, and the Best Actress Award was won by Tatiana Masrani, the Black Orphans.
The winner of this Emmy award is the "The Game of Power" and the "American Crime Story".
"American Crime Story" covers the big prizes for mini operas/television movies, and "The Game of Power" receives 12 big prizes, including the best set of dramas, the best director and the best writer.
So, the Game of Power has won 38 Emmys, making it the biggest television series ever.
Unfortunately, this year's "The Game of Power" won nothing on the actor award.

International Online News (journalist Liu Zhen): On 18th, the Economics and Commerce Branch of the Italian Embassy in China organized a China-Italy environmental convention to exchange views and reach a positive consensus among business and scientific institutions from both countries on cooperation between the two countries in the field of renewable resources in the new context.
China is known to be represented mainly by China Renewable Resources Development Co. Ltd., China International Network for Transfer of Technology, and Italy, which is made up of the Global Energy Environment Exchange, the Federation of Enterprises of the Bologna Region of Italy, etc.
The representative of Italy stated that Italy had diverse environmental technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources and proposed pilot projects with China in the areas of industrial waste disposal, waste oil treatment and waste incineration equipment, and looked forward to extending the experience of China ' s environmental cooperation to other parts of the world.
Update on the results of the Swedish age assessment test for asylum-seekers
According to the latest results of the Swedish asylum test, which used the latest methodology to medically assess their age, over 80 per cent of those tested were found to be over 18 years of age, but not all believed it to be accurate.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine Center (R?tttsmediacinalverket) started this test earlier this year.
Having been accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees claiming to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to making a more accurate age assessment in the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Service has sent 6880 testers, and the results of a total of 2481 testers between mid-March and 31 July 2017 have been published by the Centre for Forensic Medicine.
80% (persons) were convicted of having reached the age of 18 or over, but in 25 other tests, the Swedish National Centre of Forensic Medicine found that the subject "may have reached the age of 18 or over".
In 432 tests, the result was that the person "may not be under the age of 18".
Tests are only for people of questionable age.
According to John Grantham of the Forensic Medical Center, these results are consistent with those of the previous months.
He said to The Local: "These data are not very different from those of the previous few months, and the numbers are very consistent."
The high percentage of cases of persons aged 18 years or over does not necessarily mean that these asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the Centre published 581 test results and stated that 442 cases "indicated that the person had reached the age of 18 or more".
The news newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests published and found that 243 of them had publicly indicated that they would be 18 years old this year.
An X-ray examination of intellectual teeth and an MRI scan of the joints, followed by an analysis by dentists and radiologists, has also been questioned in some areas.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the press paper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurements used should be like this.
It's an inaccurate determination of biological age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend that we can do it. "
But Grenson at the forensics center defended the accuracy of these tests: "The risk of determining that a child is an adult is, by and large, low. "
The greatest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, which is about 10%.
The governor of West Virginia announced a change of party.
Thursday night, Jim Justice, Governor of the West Virginia Democratic Party, announced at a rally of President Trump that he would change his party.
"I like it, I don't like it, the Democrats have left me." The governor said.
"Today, after a lot of prayers and a lot of thought, I will tell you that today I will tell you, in my capacity as West Virginian, that I can no longer help you in my capacity as Governor of the Democratic Party. "
The rally broke out cheering.
"So tomorrow, I'm going to change the party to Republican." Justice added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell you it's time to start another race. "
Trump promised a major announcement at an earlier gathering in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42% of West Virginia's votes, while Justice didn't support Democrat Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice was selected as the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
"Forbes" states that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in five states.
At the moment, he's worth about $159 million.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying, "The change of Governor Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which will not prevent our country from becoming great again, but will make our country great again."
" The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors and has the lowest number of State Councils in its history. The Governor ' s statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost its leadership from top to bottom and has been unable to find an active unifying slogan " , Rona McDaniel, President of the Republican National Council, in a statement to the CBS News.

Sebastian Co. praises Russia's "really" apology for the stimulant scandal.
Thursday, Sebastian Ko, President of the International Federation of Fields and Fields, expressed appreciation for Russia's apology for the stimulant scandal and stated that it was "open" but reiterated that this was not the time for Russia to re-engage in the campaign.
The President of the Russian Federation of Fields and Fields, Mitri Hiractin, stated at the IUA General Assembly on the eve of the World Championships that his country was right to be prohibited from participating in the campaign and that he was determined to combat stimulants.
He expressed his regret that "all athletes who won gold and silver medals in the game were denied medals."
Despite his comments, the International Federation voted in favour of maintaining the ban. Earlier, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report referred to the discovery of evidence of Russian state-sponsored use of stimulants, which was enforced in November 2015.
"I think today's response was very frank and very frank, and the President of the International Federation told the press.
" The entire Council and the UTA Assembly are pleased ... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has gone through a very hot period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can re-enter the competition. "
Ko said he was also happy that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entry.
"I think it's a very constructive day, and I think we've made some progress, but the UTA General Assembly supports the recommendation of the panel, and it is not yet time to reinstate Russia."
"We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate innocent athletes from contaminated systems," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Federation of Fields, will participate as neutral players in the World Fields Championship on Friday in London.
On Monday, the head of the UTA team, Vern Anderson, stated that Russia had not met a number of criteria for resuming its participation.
After he spoke to the International Federation of Fields Councils in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still inadequate and prohibited coaches were still teaching.
This morning, during the first anniversary of the implementation of the Beijing City Regulation on Tobacco Control, the young student representatives who won the national tobacco control video on my declaration interacted with the national tobacco control poster ambassador, Huang, and reviewed the collection of video and the presentation of the award-winning outstanding work.

The median value of RMB 6.4401 depreciated at 66 base points, and the increase was delayed.
Macroeconomics Information Sharing 2018-01-18 09:50
On January 18th, the renminbi gave a median value of 6.4001 to the United States dollar, which depreciated by 66 basis points on the previous trading day, ending the previous five consecutive increases.
The overnight market, the dollar warms up, the dollar index moves out of the V type, reporting 90.8900 as of 07:30 Beijing time.
According to the Federal Reserve's publication of the economic brown paper, almost all of the 12 Federal Reserve regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018, remaining optimistic about the outlook for the year.
Meanwhile, unemployment in the United States remained at 4.1 per cent in December, the lowest since 2000, and businesses are expected to raise their wages in the coming months.
Federal Reserve officials generally agreed that tax changes were a factor supporting this modest and robust economic outlook, and the Federal Reserve projected a 2.5 per cent growth rate and a three-time increase in interest rates by 2018.
Marketers have pointed out that, in recent times, the ECB monetary policy has tightened expectations of an increase in the euro exchange rate, that the dollar index has declined continuously, and that there has been a corresponding surge in the renminbi against the dollar, but it is unlikely that the ECB will soon adjust its policy stance, that short-term fluctuations in foreign exchange markets will eventually lead to a return to fundamentals, and that the continued smooth operation of the renminbi exchange rate is an event of probability.
It is worth noting that, as the market is expected to stabilize the renminbi, the attractiveness of the renminbi assets to investors abroad has become more pronounced.

What's the impact of football's financial rules on Neymar's transition to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending at European football clubs will not prevent Nemar from moving from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the San German Football Club in Paris (PSG) in France at record prices.
As a result, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has further downgraded the San German Football Club in Paris.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules, launched by FIFA in 2011, mean that the Paris St. Germain Football Club must finally prove that Nemar's transfer will be funded without causing a huge loss.
The Barcelona Club has paid €222 million ($262 million) just to pay the Brazilian player's severance, and Nemar's salary will be up to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Nemar's transfer to France.
Considering that the team is funded by the ruling family of Qatar, the San Germain Football Club in Paris can, of course, contract Nemar in cash and include him in the other stars.
Clubs can spend a lot of money buying players, but they have to use legal sources of income to make up for the huge sums they spend, so that they can balance their profits and losses in football-related business.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected president of FIFA in 2007.
The former French player believes that if banks or all the people withdraw their support funds, they are actually deceiving and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt to club loss monitoring.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought the Chelsea Club in 2003 -- buying a potential club, then spending a lot of money to improve the team and build a global brand -- is now facing a more demanding situation.
In the three-year rule evaluation period until 2018, the club could lose 30 million euros.
Despite Abu's denigration by the then President in 2015, UEFA's successor, Alexander Ceferin, remained committed to stopping excessive spending.
Of course, the "rules" have not expired, and we will certainly strengthen the future regulations.
Although the San German Football Club in Paris will pay off Nemar's buyout in a lump sum, it can also allocate the amount for accounting purposes within the term of the contract.
Nemar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer may show costs of Euro44.4 million in the next five years' annual accounts.
The first wave of "rules" sanctions imposed in 2014 resulted in the most severe sanctions being imposed on the San Germain Football Club in Paris and the Manchester City Club in Abu Dhabi.
The San German Football Club in Paris was fined €60 million (at the current rate of $82 million), which was reduced to €20 million, and asked the championship team in the 2014-15 season to reduce the number of players to 21 instead of the normal 25 players.
U.S.F. is looking at clubs that try to raise their income by linking with club owners and deceive financial regulators.
Although companies in Qatar can sponsor the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, if the amount of the sponsorship is considered to be above the standard market price, then UEFA will not regard it as a legitimate income.
This is what happened in 2014, when the UEFA ruled that the amount of Qatar Tourist's sponsorship of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris was exaggerated.
It was reported that part of Nemar's income at the St. Germain Football Club in Paris might come from payments made by the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022.
But both the Paris St. Germain Football Club and the organizing committee denied that Nemar would be the World Cup ambassador, and it would be easy for UEFA regulators to take such an initiative.
The recent sanctions against the St. Germain Football Club in Paris mean that UFO will be more vigilant about any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to the source on Thursday, UEFA did not pre-discuss with the St. Germain Football Club in Paris about Nemar's transfer.
All of the above-mentioned persons have approached the Associated Press only in an anonymous capacity, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation at the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.
Last published accounts show that the Paris San German Football Club earned 542.4 million euros in 2015-16, making more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the previous financial year were not yet disclosed.
Paris's St. Germain Club predicts that Nemar's alliance will bring evangelization to sponsorship, franchising and the sale of jerseys.
The club is expected to grow by at least 30% to sign off on Nemar.
Apparently, the Spanish coalition was outraged to see one of the most famous players leave, attempting to block Nemar's move and claiming that Paris's St. Germain Football Club violated the rules.
President Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of a financial stimulant, which is the same for clubs and countries" and refers to Qatar, which has the ultimate ownership of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.
Arsene Wenger, coach of the Arsenal team, has reservations about the state-funded club and the U.S.A.
"This is the consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the entire ecology of 15 years of football." Wynge said on Thursday.
"When the state owns a club, everything happens.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the "rules" because there are many different ways or interests for a country to require a big player to represent a country. "

Nostalgic Infective Markets - "Halla summer camp" and "Inspectors."
To repeat this story is to remember the great years of the '80s and the garbage age of the '90s (david Wayne and Michael Shuwalt made a sketch of the MTV "country" ); and to remember the past itself, and the year 2001; that year, many of the stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Luther had yet to emerge.
As a cultural art, it's a mimic and a reflection of our permanent memory of the Facebook age.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
The first day of the camp was strong, but it wasn't just because of its ridiculous humor.
In the scene, double the use of the core joke -- middle-aged actors playing children of the age of trouble -- made it impossible to go back into the past and become a funny part of it.
Ten years later, adults actually played adults, and emotions were not too deep, and imitation was more widespread, including improvisation of the 90s, like "The Hand of the Cradle."
At some point, a character was trapped in an apple notebook, some straight skates and some other 1991 stuff.
A lot of the core stories are the same.

There was another vicious conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan, also played by Mr. Hugh, instigated by George H. W. Bush, who was impressed by Michael Ian Black.

It's a randomly crazy moment, and it's likely to give momentum to this film, like the retrospect of the Seven Years of Life series, until it comes to the logical conclusion: "Hara camps: 20 years later," and it's the last act that's gonna get these Casses to see the premiere of the "Hara camps."

The main players - Grigor, hard-core, and Ethel, idealist - were played by Florin Pierce, Jr., and Cornelius Ulić, respectively, with a dialogue between Channing Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Lavitt in English.
It's a wonderful idea.
But it's not just an idea.
There's some good visual look.
And there's a lot of celebrities -- including Jenny Slater, Nick Ofman, Mahsala Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevini -- who have made a great sound gathering.
But Detective Big Hung was so dedicated to building a loud and real comedy, where there was a killer with a Reagan mask on his head, and it usually played that role.
This six-part television show is a little slow, and the comedy effects are not fast or frequent enough.
Detective Daphne's long editing is much more rigorous, showing a better sarcasm when Gregor and Ethel visited the U.S. embassy, because there are always two fat guys in the embassy lobby who swallow up a bunch of burgers.

According to recent interviews with journalists, there has been a general decline and even a loss in the benefits of the north-east industry, such as iron and steel, orbital traffic, ships, mechanical manufacturing, etc.
In the view of some experts, under the present circumstances, the new round of industrial revitalization in the north-east is not only related to the national economic recovery but will also have an impact on the long-term development of our manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, and therefore needs to be adjusted for transformation.
The general decline in business efficiency in traditional industries, which has lost much of its value in the raw materials industry and in the manufacturing of heavy machinery and equipment, has been the primary manifestation of the current economic downturn in the north-central and north-eastern industries.
In the past, the economy was downhill, mainly at the lower end, with a high impact on primary products, but this economic volatility affected low-end industrial products at the higher end of traditional Northeast industries.
The past few years, starting with the restructuring of products, focused on the development of high-end plates, such as container boards, steel tracks, shipboards and civilian household panels, have seen a significant decline in sales of these varieties this year, especially when sales of shipboards decreased by 50 per cent compared to the same period last year.

The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25 per cent interest rate.
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain the same, and previous weak economic growth and moderate inflation have dashed hopes for upward adjustment.
The Bank of England warns that economic growth will continue to be "weak" because it controls interest rates while tightening household income.
Policymakers in the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain a 0.25% interest rate by a vote of 6-2 while a few members this month called for higher interest rates, even if weak economic growth had weakened the upwards.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced growth projections for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, and issued warnings that the contraction in household income would continue, while inflation would surge to nearly 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, it was suggested that in the coming years, interest rates would need to be increased to contain the inflation brought about by the de-Ouerium, while borrowing costs might need to be increased more sharply than expected in financial markets.
A year ago, a de-European-affected country implemented a large-scale economic promotion policy, and members voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the discontinuation of the scheduled financing scheme to provide banks with cheap financing starting next February, although the bank claims that under the scheme, the bank will now need an additional Pound15 billion over and above £115 billion.
In the records of the meetings on interest rate decisions, the Bank of England stated: " In the MPC core forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) has remained weak in the recent past, as the contraction in real household income will continue to stifle consumption. "
With regard to interest rates, the Bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "some monetary policy tightening" to suppress inflation and for "a greater degree" than the market expected.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year, and for the second time in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increase would be slow and restrained.
Growth projections for the Bank for this year and next year show a downward trend, compared to 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent in May.
The bank maintains a 1.8% growth forecast for 2018.
The British pound has fallen against the United States dollar, and the euro has followed.
The exchange rate of the Pound to the United States dollar fell by 0.5 per cent to 1.31 and the euro by 0.4 per cent to 1.11.
Before the decision-making that remained unchanged, the rising expectations were dashed by recent unoptimistic growth figures. GDP rose to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to 0.2 per cent in the first three months.
The line says the growth in the third quarter is likely to be at 0.3%, although it will be slightly higher by the end of the year.
The average household was hit by a sharp rise in inflation and wage growth was negligible, and their recent inflation report by the Bank of England did not give them any good news, because it said that austerity would get worse before it got better.
And it says monetary policy "can't prevent" income shocks in the next few years, but wages are expected to recover "large-scale" by the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, because of the depreciation of the pound sterling and the substantial increase in demand for British commodities, the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the low consumption.
One year before the decision was made, an alarming European Union referendum caused the pound to collapse, and in August the interest rate was lowered to 0.25 per cent.
The Bank of England estimates that it will take four years to have a full impact on prices and the British economy.
Before the bank published its latest interest rate ruling, the call for interest rates to rise was strong, as inflation worsened the average household that was already under stress, while three policymakers called for an upward adjustment of the interest rate to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month inflation fell from 2.9 per cent in June to 2.6 per cent, although the Bank of England said it was expected and would rise again in the next few months.
The line is called 2% of its target, and the excess is already the last line of the weak pound.
The director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, Andrew Monterk, said: "In the light of the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market appears to be again becoming more competitive, as lenders strongly appeal for more business and look forward to a positive ending this year.
For those who may be close to ending existing transactions, such markets seem particularly advantageous, as re-collateralization (many free of charge and low interest rates) is becoming more popular.
The Chinese seismic network officially determined that an earthquake of 8.0 magnitude occurred in New Zealand on 13 November at 1902 hours (42.53° S and 173.05° E). The source of the earthquake was 10 km in depth and the capital, Wellington, felt strongly.
The UK National Health Service (NHS) has a highly controversial HIV drug on the green light.
After the end of the High Court's administration of NHS drug funding, patients will be able to get "changed" HIV prophylaxis from September.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be administered before sexual intercourse, has proven to reduce the risk of infection among high-risk groups by about 86%. Health services will now provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year initial test.
It agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court decision last year, which stated that, although the NHS claimed that the local authorities should fund the drug, the NHS was entitled to pay the costs of the PrePEP.
The announcement on Thursday was referred to by British CEO Simon Stevens as "a major new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as "a critical moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered sexual health clinics to be registered. More clinics will join in October, followed by full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PREP) is an HIV drug that is administered before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce the spread of HIV among populations at risk of infection.
Pre-sexual use means that there are enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This drug can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexuals, transgender people and HIV-positive people who have not been successfully treated.
The clinic will determine whether the eligible participants, including men, women, transgender people and their sexual partner HIV infection status is unknown for antiretroviral treatment.
Persons who reside in England and are registered as general practitioners may also enrol in sexual health clinics where they attend.

The UK AIDS Trust (NAT) CEO Deborah King said, "This is the critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target populations in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offer the possibility of changing the AIDS epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk of HIV will be able to access this test in England, funded by the NHS, to acquire a new authorized tool that is truly stand-alone and does not require consultation with sexual partners, which will bring about improvements in the lives of many people.
We're in favour of this announcement. "
The CEO of the Terence Higgins Trust, Ian Greene, said, "The first thing to do now is to make sure that the experiment is rolled out rapidly across the country and that none of those infected with HIV is left behind.
Now that we've purchased the Prop experimental drugs, we're ready to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV. "
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgeson claims: "After months of delay and government delays, the prEP's initial trial began to be popular and should have arrived earlier.
Evidence suggests how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and preventing the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This experiment will allow us to go even further and fully understand the advantages of the PEP.
It is now very important that the experiment be rolled out nationwide as soon as possible in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further to end the spread of HIV in society ... "

High quality of life: using lofts and smart designs to make small condos of the Count's Palace a home of spaciousness
Joanne Ray was a banker, and she was very interested in renovating the house, and in 2014 she moved from the house at the Knightsbridge to a small apartment at the Count's Palace.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne balcony -- Joanne didn't pack and sell it, which is a strong proof of the new design.
"Until then, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house at Knightbridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for the right house to offer.
I saw this apartment at the Count's Palace, and it had a tall ceiling.
I liked it. I made an offer the same day. "
Since the first look, this 1,000 square feet apartment has now been completely overhauled.
This apartment was originally a complex single room -- it needed to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- and Joanne was trying to increase storage space and the attic to take full advantage of the size of the ceiling.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's what I'm asking, "She said.
To that end, she hired Elfan Azadi from Duck Shed's Building and Design Studio, located in Mount Notting Hill, to use this 12.5-foot ceiling to build a home, not just a project, but where Joanne lives.
The ceiling's not high enough to add two spaces up and down, so the challenge is to create a loft that's high enough to stand up.
Elfan has to think creatively to solve this problem.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We must arrange for space to be displayed and without shrugs.
Not only is it simple to build a simple platform, but the steel must be activated so that it can be at the right height to function ... "
Through this arrangement, Elfan can get two rooms in the space -- it can add a lot of interesting elements.
The penthouse uses retrouvius branded retrouvius retro-coated copper windows that can look over the fascinating areas of life.
Gold furniture with mirrors, silver pieces of furniture and Sergei Mouille's retrofitted lighting set the whole style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Put mirrors on both ends of the short corridor and make it look much longer.
In the kitchen, a spatterboard with mirrors is like a window to another room.
At the entrance, a small grid with mirrors provides Joanne with storage space for the dishes and glassware.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space to put the kitchen away when it's not used.
The folding kitchen is not new.
But the unique thing about this folding kitchen is that it's a garage-style lift door.
"It involves knowledge of some engineering fields, and Elfan explains the steel-stretching MDF door.
"This follows the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
As a result of the clever use of space and storage, Joanne received an extra 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, you sell the size of the house -- or your property is valued on the basis of the size of the house," said Elfan.
"By and large, the realtor would walk into the room and calculate it on the basis of the size of the floor... "
They'll try to increase the amount of space they occupy and use high-quality materials, thus giving the space a sense of luxury.
Elfan says, "The materials are all of your own choosing, thus helping to create emotional ties at home."
"You won't fall in love with the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't tie your heart. "
It turns out that with good design and extra space, standard flats can shake you up.
In fact, you might choose to live like Joanne.

Two brothers in a $500 million real estate empire battle.
Forty years after his Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers fought for more than $500 million, one of Victoria's largest real estate empires.
Colin De Lutis, a former director and developer of Carlton Football Club, lived in a mansion in Tucla District, and three doors were at his brother Paul's residence, who took him to the Supreme Court on the division of their real estate and business assets.
Since 2014, Paul has wanted to leave the family business, but the two brothers had a heated debate in the Supreme Court over the division of assets.
The brothers and their mother owned 38 properties worth more than $500 million that had accumulated since the family bought Smith Street, Colin Wood District, 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually developed it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for $85 million.
At the moment, the De Rutis family's portfolio includes the city office, the Braunsch and Sorento development projects, the Golden Coast and Burler Hill apartments, and the suburban shopping mall.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, known by his brother, Paul, as the "principal promoter and dominant man" of the De Rutis family, owns about two thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounts for about one third.
According to the documents submitted to the Tribunal, Colin owned $316 million in converted property while Paul owned $176 million in property.
Paul came to believe that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the bargain.
" Colin ' s proposal for the division of property left him what I thought was best " , he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failures in mediation, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Now, the two brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
Colin denied it and accused Paul of not managing certain properties.
In Colin's earlier affidavit, he expressed the wish to settle the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines the family as the most important option.
The cost of the case is rising, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails, and company reports from top law firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Carter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. De Rutis and her late husband, Luigi, both Italian immigrants, started running popular restaurants and deli stores in the late 1950s, and bought a shop in Braunrick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy Colin Wood's property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I read in senior year, where he founded Westco," when Paul was very young.
Anna De Rutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to pass their property to their son in peace.
"Louigi used to say to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of De Rutis, and Colin said that when Mark left, he paid him $10 million and he paid Luke $26 million.
Paul says Luke and Mark are both "satisfied with the division of their property."
According to Eddie McGuire, a television star, published in 2015, Colin kept a low profile despite being a member of the board of directors of the former AFL Club.
"Fairfax Media" contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
But Colin was the only one who replied by text.
"My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad " , he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court file that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
He said, "Our father doesn't want Paul and I to end up in a dispute like this," and added, "he still has hope for a settlement."
Friday, this hope seems to be dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the President's media time.
Others have tried, but they have failed.
John F. Kelly may be able to do it.
If that's the case, he's the first.
According to the U.S. Political News site Politico, the new White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including media reports, in order to ensure greater stability for the boss.
Here is a quote taken from the journalist Josh Darcy:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, came together on his first day of work to discuss with senior officials, he said that he was going to solve one of the main problems of President Tripp's entry into the White House: bad information to the President."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the President to make better decisions, so the information would need to be in his hands — both in writing and in the form of briefings.
Kelly's diagnosis looks like it, but others tried to tame Trump by watching his media time, but they all ended up failing.
President Trump's television addiction has been a long time-- and now in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still growing.
In February, Sam Naberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico, "If candidate Trump is frustrated about unfair reporting, it would be useful to let him know that he has received positive reports on credible channels.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that, based on the experience of the six former campaign officials, the control of Trump's Twitter habit was focused on ensuring that the media messages he personally received always contained a certain amount of praise.
It's totally fine.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was "controlled" was ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know -- that if they hadn't intervened, Trump's Twitter would have been even more angry.
We may never know that Trump didn't send those tweets.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, even a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one can keep Trump out of controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of competing groups, people promote their worldviews and their cause by presenting to Trump information that may or may not be reliable.
Politico -- all about this story -- reported in May the interest of the advisers in strategically providing suspicious information to the President.
This is an example described by journalist Shane Goodmancher:
"The current and former Trump officials say that Trump's reaction to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive leaks, would be a mad attempt to find their source.
At the end of February, there was a malicious copy to the President of an article on the website of the cyber-seditor Charles C. Johnson, GotNews.com, accusing the Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walsh, of being the White House's "source of massive information leaks", as Trump did.
Even though Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had blown up a lot of false accusations, which were later openly denied.
Trump looked at the article and started asking officials about Walsh. "
Goodmancher also said that the then Chief of Staff, Reines Pribas, and the White House Secretary, Robert Potter, had tried to set up a system to manage and record the documents that Trump had received.
And?
Kelly's gonna do the same thing in three months.
Maybe he can prove that he's a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his assistant is still competing for influence.
These eternal influences will make Kelly's mission even more difficult.
Traveling town: how to get drunk.
[Summary] The potential of Zhejiang town is being awakened.
These towns are now an important destination for tourists to visit Zheshan water, to read Zheshan culture and to feel the sorrow of Zhejiang, and will also provide an important contribution to my efforts to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China in the Zhejiang.
Winning's in love.
"The social scene goes up with the moon, and the salami smells up with the wind.
"Standing through the town of Shao Xing Anchangu, traditional handicrafts such as kettles, bamboo making, iron, shoes, flowers and cotton-swinging, the intangible cultural heritage of the town of An Xiancheng has been amply demonstrated. Tourists have been intoxicated by the experience of Shao Xing Folklore and the culture of history has grown.
According to the information received, more than 65,000 visitors to Anchangu town during the three-day holiday on New Year's Day.
In Zhejiang, a unique town like Anchangu town, the Zhejiang town of Ka Xianxi Tong is filled with light, warm and euphemism, the White Wall Dewa of the 28th county, which claims to be the end of the millennium, and the painting of the fisherman of Stone Tong Town in Taizhou, which sculpts the traditional and modern-day fisherman who lives the town of Zhejiang, which is the "hand of the hand" of the Zhejiang and the "the love of the eight tourists.
In recent years, the potential of the town of Zhejiang has been awakened as we move forward with tourism throughout our province.
In 2016, the provincial government's office officially released the Zhejiang province's "Travel-Corporation Scheme for the Creation of Zhejiang Tourist Towns", proposing that, over a period of about five years, 100 or so popular, eco-friendly and tourist-rich provincial tourist towns be named after the province over a period of about five years.
These towns are now an important destination for tourists to visit Zheshan water, to read Zheshan culture and to feel the sorrow of Zhejiang, and will also provide an important contribution to my efforts to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China in the Zhejiang.
The director of the Department of Tourism explained that, in the midst of the creation of tourist-friendly small towns, I now place greater emphasis on the construction of individualized tourism industries in various towns of the province, and that new tourism projects and business developments have brought a great deal of experience and a great reputation to tourists.
It's about replicating.
Recently, the Zhejiang Daily Press Group hosted by the Zhejiang Department of Tourism and the Zhejiang Press Group and hosted by the Zhejiang Group's All-Media Center for Tourism, held the closing ceremony of the Zhejiang Tourist Festival in Zhejiang Province.
"There's art in Windy Town, there's the temperature of life.
The style of the town lies in the original juice, the original taste, the native land, the pureness of the original ecology.
"Students in the Department of Film and Visual Arts of the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, Director of the first-line video advertising in China, and Professor Seo Toi-hyun, Director of the Chinese University of Metrology and Communications, told cross-border stories about small towns like "The Little Village Renovation" in the lens.
Many of Zhejiang's popular tourist towns have great cultural resources, and the new town representative Dong of Lake City has been reading the country's painting on the scene.
Gangnam's style has been well received by painters since ancient times, and now the town of Nanyangu is working in depth with the Chinese Academy of American Arts and others.
A tourist-like town must have its elements, tourism elements, service elements and environmental elements.
In this case, the services and environment of tourism are also very important.
A timely umbrella on a rainy day will make the tourists feel better about the town.
In this shared era, the hottest shared umbrella company in Zhealers' All-Media Tour Center has designed a series of shared umbrellas for the Poetry of the Zhejiang edition, hoping to promote the idea of "Shared? Green", to promote civilized tourism awareness and public decency among tourists and town residents and to create a good shared tourism environment.
It's a bright spot in the Poetry of Zhejiang.
I'm looking forward to it.
To date, Zhejiang province has published a list of the first 21 provincial tourist-friendly towns and 115 provincial tourist-friendly town-breeding lists.
As a priority area for the development of rural tourism during the 13th and 5th periods, the town will eventually be built up as a 3A and above tourist attraction, becoming a new model for tourism product diversification, high tourism efficiency and industrial integration.
The key to the attraction of tourist town is its original taste.
The beauty of a small, tourist-friendly town stems not only from a small, cloudy bridge, but also from a long cultural tradition; the revival of the country is from cultural self-confidence.
At the international level, the Dutch towns of Lisser, Harstadt, Austria, and Pumpkin, France, with the tulips, salt and pumpkins at their core, attract a large number of tourists from all over the world each year, making tourism a driving force for the economy of the town.
For a small town of grace, the emphasis on "speciality, preservation" has given the town a distinct personality and soul, and more so on providing cultural insinuation, carrying a local history and showing the country's civilization.
A small tourist town, bound by culture and nationalism and carried by humanities and landscapes, followed by tourists, where traditional styles and cultures were passed on in shared construction and innovation.
In essence, tourist town is a complex, open tourist attraction, and it should be a shared living space between local residents and tourists and even tourists.
As the main battleground for future tourism growth, tourist-like small towns are likely to change not only the ecological landscape of the countryside, the way in which economic and social development takes place, the direction of industrial factor flows, but also to bridge the rural-urban infrastructure gap and to awaken the rural culture.
Zhejiang Tourist Town will play a much better story in the growing tide of the country's revival.
According to data, 70 per cent of China ' s travel needs are concentrated within 3 kilometres, so that the entire short-distance market is the world of shared bicycles sooner or later.

These "back-to-back"s are nothing but an end-of-the-sea.
The RV negotiates the ditch and goes back to Rich Man Street.
Some of the richest owners in the Simidranz region have reoccupying with determined cabbies who have negotiated for the return of land outside the mansion in a ditch opened by the government.
Rovers parked 20 of their trailers in an empty area outside the luxurious Soliher Street, which is called "The Rich Man Street."
The cabbies, carrying horses, carrying babies and leading a caravan, returned again after being driven out in May, and the city's excavated moat did not prevent them from entering.
This smooth and sophisticated team found a gap in the line of defense, and although there was no road to set up a roadblock to pass, their vehicles squeezed through the gap.
Angry residents have harshly criticized the Solihull Council for its "bad behavior in dealing with this issue".
One of the unnamed residents said, "They arrived there Monday night, before coming to Benlich Street, throwing stones at the passers-by.
The Commission should be ashamed of what they did, because they were nothing to deal with.
The cabbies came here in May and they got kicked out, and now they're back.
It's been a lot last night. It's probably more today. "
She added, "The Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with it by imposing a permanent injunction to protect its park.
I live on Streetsbrook, and if the council can't stop this, I won't pay the city tax.
A local resident who doesn't want to give his name said, "That's ridiculous. We just saw the last group of RVs go away, just to make it easier for another group to destroy.
This time, the number has increased, and people have even seen horses eating on the park lawn. "
A female spokesman for the Soliher Commission said, "We know that unauthorized camping is taking place in an empty area on Sjutzbrook Road, and now we work with the Soliher police and take the necessary legal action to get them out of here as soon as possible.
In order to support us in gathering evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal acts to the police by calling.
This helps us to outline the circumstances of our case before the Court for its examination ... "

This year, more efforts will be made to address the salient issues in the four express delivery industries.
China ' s delivery capacity in 2012 was 5.6 billion, with 10,000 express delivery three-wheel drive roads, uniform standards, uniform marking, and unified insurance, both facilitating delivery and ensuring safety.
This is not the first time that the United Nations has tried to use a virtual role as Honorary Ambassador.

Italy ' s hard-line attitude towards the non-governmental organization Migrant Rescue Ship
Italy warns non-governmental organizations operating migrant rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue the rescue unless new operational regulations are signed.
The Minister of the Interior, Marco Minnity, said in an interview with The Turin Daily News: "If non-governmental organizations do not sign the new code of conduct, it is hard to see how they will continue. "
On the day before Minnity's warning, the Italian authorities detained the crew of a German aid organization, "Youth for Rescue", on suspicion that they were actually collaborating with human traffickers and assisting illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operates for only one year and refuses to comment on the specific subject of the charges against Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Caltocio.
In a social media statement, the organization said, " For us, saving lives is, and will be, the most important thing, and we regret that we cannot operate in the SAR area at this time. "
" Once all the information has been gathered, we can now only assess all the allegations and the situation ... "
The Italian official has been watching the Youth Rescue ship since October, the Iuventa.
Their crews are suspected of carrying human traffickers directly from small boats and allow smugglers to flee in haste and re-use ships.
According to the prosecutor's file, at least one such meeting was said to have taken place at sea 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya.
Its crew is suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which supervises rescue operations in the area for humanitarian and not any other motives.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer to supervise their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in SAR operations have agreed to abide by the norms of conduct: Save the Children, a maritime aid station based in Malta, and Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered that the new provisions, while unnecessary, were acceptable because they would not bring about any "significant change and obstruction" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti claims that the number of immigrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and unite local mayors have begun to bear fruit.
The Minister said, "For the last few days, we have begun to see the dawn at the end of the tunnel. "
He announced plans for in-depth talks this month: discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development activities and with Chad, Niger and Mali on ways to reduce the number of immigrants wishing to leave these countries for Europe.
The Chief Financialist of the Transport Bank even indicated that industrial value added was expected to accelerate to 6.6 per cent in December, owing to late-season patterns of industrial value addition in the first three quarters of 2017.
The cumulative increase in investment in fixed assets is expected to be 7.2 per cent in December, at the same rate as last month, down from last year.
Industrial production, though weaker than in October, is almost the same as in November.
In December, our manufacturing investment was low, but capital investment improved slightly, so it is expected that the fixed asset investment will remain at the same level as in November.

Beijing's New Detachment Initiative: 10,000 teachers and students from North Chemical will be admitted to Changping New School District.
The inauguration of the new campus of the Beijing Chemical University took place in Changping District, Beijing, with 1,800 acres of green campus officially operational.
The journalists learned from the ceremony that, in recent years, in the context of Beijing's desire for collaborative development and defusing of non-capital functions, in order to strengthen the capital's core functions and to combat the disease, Beijing has accelerated the diversion of the central city colleges to the suburbs, and that teachers and students in some colleges are moving to the new campuses in the outskirts of the capital, such as Hinhing and Hsinyama.
The North Chemical New School, located in Changping South Point Town, covering 1,800 acres and 40 km from the city, is one of the priority projects for the defusing of non-capital functions in Beijing City.
Three phases of construction have been completed for the new school, and the second phase is expected to be fully launched by the end of the year, with the completion plan meeting the learning and living needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and teaching staff.

Michelle Carter was sentenced to suicide by texting Conrad Roy.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and telephone calls.
In the current year, 20-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months and can be converted to a suspended sentence, plus a suspended sentence of five years.
Carter was convicted in June of unintentional and premeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is devastated.
My son is my best friend."
Carter was granted personal liberty while awaiting appeal.
She's facing a maximum of 20 years' imprisonment, but her lawyers think she and Mr. Roy are both mentally ill.
At the time of sentencing, Carter stood up, wearing red pants and white coats, with tight hands, tears in his eyes, looking down.
"She killed Conrad Roy." The prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life for better.
She didn't take responsibility " , the prosecutor said.
"She doesn't have any regrets. "
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence, and she felt very sorry for it."
However, the judge of Lawrence Moniz said that he had not found that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, could have any significant impact on her behavior."
A prosecutor read a statement by Lynn Roy, Roy's mother, saying, "I don't have a day to feel sorry for losing my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of what I did and what I did... and I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain, which will accompany us forever " , stating...
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "mental" because she realized that she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become an aunt of his children.
"The loss of a man who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and I'll spend the rest of my life with it." She said.
This case seems to set a legal precedent because Massachusetts's laws do not make it a crime to encourage others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a car; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
Carter's texting revealed that after she encouraged him to commit suicide, the case drew national attention.
"Hungled, jumped, stabbed himself in many ways." "She said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family.
The time before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," and all you have to do is start the generator, and then get free and happy."
Judge Monitz said that Carter had drawn attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are differences of law in this case.
One of the few people who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and acquitted two years later.
In a 30-year-old column published in the Los Angeles Times, Ms. Knox said, "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment."
Zhang was destined to be a controversial film artist who, since he started making his first film, "Red Gospel", had gained a lot of arguments while leading the Chinese film.
Journalists learned on 2 February from Lhasa net earthball club that recently the Lassard net earth basketball team won its fourth final in the National Youth Basketball League in Beijing.
Lhasa Pure-Turkish Youth Team, composed of 11 local players, was coached by the Assistant Coach of the Lasa-Turkish Boys Basket, In-song Ju.
The Tibetan Basketball Kid before he went to Beijing for the finals.
Leung Jun-soo, Director-General of Lassard Basketball Club, said to journalists that the team's performance had improved compared to last year, that there had been a marked improvement in the team's self-confidence and confidence in the game, that there had been more thorough, more frequent and easier interaction between players and other teams.
At the end of the game, Captain Jiang Tso said he wanted to gain experience by participating in the game and do his best for the basketball business in Tibet.
It is understood that in Beijing, players overcome low-altitude intoxication, etc., and present Tibet.
Although the track is a gold medal in the Olympics and the track earner is in the world, the track name will be lower than the pool of gold.
Automobile manufacturer facing shock, Audi will modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before Audi announced that the BMW would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 cars.
The BMW chairman said that BMW believes that "driving has more intelligent choices than limits" means that major European cities -- including Munich, where BMW is based -- consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Dimler announced on Tuesday that 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe would be converted to reduce their diesel emissions.
No company claims to have done so as a recall.
European automobile manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emission requirements.
But nitrogen oxides released from diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
Installation of equipment by automobile companies to offset the cost of diesel tail gas emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As German auto manufacturers face censorship, Prime Minister Angela Merkel's government has been accused of leaving too much of these powerful car companies and neglecting the signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the popular pattern of using so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations during car testing and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
Many public officials have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by the countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachero Giovani Pamio is Italian and therefore not protected by extradition, and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the general public, and the German government accused Audi of installing a system to evade European emission requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi's investigation could have a major impact on the public: luxury car manufacturers have a disproportionate share of the profits of popular cars.
It's common for a movie to run for a year or two or a few years.
Animated film "The Big Fish Seagull" announced that it would be released on July 8th, 12 years from the time it was prepared to the time it was released!
The original author of Big Fish Sea Twilight, 21-year-old from the University of Tsinghua's Thermal Power Profession, founded with his best friend Zhang Chun, received a multimillion dollar venture in 2008 to launch an animated film "The Big Fish Sea Tzu".
The film has won many national and international prizes in the creative film phase, and has been recorded and praised as one of the most outstanding works of art by the Centre for Contemporary Art in Pompidou, France.
It's been six years since it was created, and it's been called "the pit of God" by millions of fans who look forward to it.
The Big Fish Seagull tells a fantastic story that belongs to the Chinese, and with the release of the premonition, it brings new expectations to all the audience.
And he said, "It's only one thing that's been done for 12 years, and now it's a dream and it's a reality, and I'm both nervous and excited."
Zhang Chun says, "I'm driving the team crazy, thinking about using one-tenth of the other's budget to do exactly the same thing as everyone else."
Toshio, a world factory that used to rely on food processing and large numbers of workers, is looking at high-quality people who can reposition the city.
During the High-Level Talent Week organized by the city government of Dongguan in recent days, the first financial reporter saw that a number of powerful local businesses were participating in the Talent Fair.
They each have a very good price on the very bright billboards under the orange background wall.
As a result, the China Television Production Industry Association decided to unite the national television production industry and sign the self-regulation convention.
Provence lavender is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is failing as a result of the continuing drought and the presence of insects carrying the virus, which gives rise to headaches among scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said, "The lavender in Provence is under great threat, because the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with a significant drop in spring rainfall and a heavy rain in the autumn.
It affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller form of man, a leaf that spreads tiny bacteria, and in a very dry weather, they appear in large numbers. "
The point is it's huge.
In addition to attracting vacationers to the elegant lavender fields, lavender oil is also being admired by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Chase says, "By contrast to the many flowers that can grow, with long valleys, we have smaller, stunted, missing or weak individuals.
That's why we have less oil. "
Solutions under study include the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the mitigation of soil water evaporation, the spraying of clay and water protection mixtures on plantations, and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
It's the story in the film that the two stars are more attracted to them than the science fiction in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5th, the Washington City Journalist, a series of interviews with a number of eminent personalities from the audience, and two performing artists from the audience, who, surprisingly, were almost silent.
One was a Berlin Shadow, and one was a rising young actor, and "psychological crime" was the first partner of Levan and Lee Yifung.
Mexico is in great danger. Journalists have been killed.
The entire staff of the weekly Riodoce usually gathers on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the Sinalot riots caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today, the shadow of tragedy looms over them, and they come together to discuss security issues.
They're told to change their daily habits. It's important.
Two senior journalists discussed what was safer: whether to take their children to the office (the office was hit by a grenade in 2009) or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: the enemy, the neutral and the ally.
They've given these reporters names in each column -- no evidence, no observation, no intuition.
Suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on government lists, or cartels, these thugs put Mexican coverage at risk.
The violence has continued, with the death of more and more journalists throughout the country: President Enrique Peña Nieto has died since he took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been protected by the Federation after being attacked and threatened; so far, at least 7 journalists have died in seven states.
The last one died was their editor and source of inspiration and co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cárdenas.
Valdez wrote a lot of books about drug violence, and in one of them he wrote, "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist."
You can feel that he's gone everywhere — a huge picture on the front of the office building in Riodoce, Valdez with a finger in his hand, with the word "justice"; and Aaron Ivara and Miriam Ramirez, 30-year-old journalists wearing T-shirts with his smile on them, and he wears glasses or his branded Panamanian straw hat.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists were discussing their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and suspicion.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists ' cases, according to the records of the Commission for the Protection of Journalists, the office prosecuted only two persons.
Every year, the majority of thousands of crimes are related to drug trafficking and organized crime, so few can bring to justice those responsible for the killing of journalists.
In Riodoce, they insist on reporting the violence in Sinaloh, although they've broken their hearts, even though the land has been devastated.
Evalla said there's no point in holding a security seminar without information about the killer and justice.
He said, "It's stupid to waste time in a seminar like this.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone. "
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of "Riodoce" in Culiacan, the capital.
His Red Toyota was stopped by two men just a few blocks away; they forced him to get out of the car and opened 12 guns, presumably because of the newspaper's name, translated into "Twelve Rivers."
The assailants left in his car and crashed him in the vicinity.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two grown-ups behind.
Kulyakan gossiped.
But there's really nothing but silence about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, the state of Sinalot has become the bloodiest battlefield in the country, where hostile forces have been killing wildly.
One or more people are shot every day in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is filled with two magnificent mausoleums of drug lords, which are common.
For the time being, the state of calm is when only one cartel controls the beach state and its ports and drug routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdez was deeply aware of the dangers of the job, 60-year-old "Riodoce" co-founder and director, Ismail Bohoque, felt guilty for failing to protect his friends.
He believed that two mistakes had caused this tragedy.
First, in February, he published an interview with Damasso Lopez, who led a cartel that fought several sons of Guzman.
This report may have provoked the sons; the newspapers were bought by suspected gang members as soon as they arrived at the news stand.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper reporting the same story was confiscated.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance for Mexican violence against journalists.
He has a long spirit, and his friends and colleagues believe he's always been with us.
He was also a senior journalist in Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce and sold a 50-dollar share.
Bohoque said in Sinaloa, "Step to journalism can't stop dealing with drugs."
With the passage of time, the newspaper won a good reputation for its bold and honest coverage and increased sales and advertising.
Journalists like to publish investigative reports that strike the key without fear of censorship, and readers like to publish stories in newspapers that others are afraid to report.
"Riodoce" won the Latin American María Moscabo News Prize five years after its creation.
In the same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdez International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug story.
He told me he was scared too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said, "I want to live."
Later in October, in an interview with the local television station Rompeviento TV, he said, "In Sinalo, drug trafficking is a way of life.
You have to be a reporter on your shoulders -- either so or deaf.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many deaths why don't you say something about what's happening?"
All of Riodoce's employees miss Valdez, he curses like a dock worker, a friend who never cares about hugging and advising, and a teacher who knows how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar across the office often sits at the same table.
Now, they will ask, "Is it his daily habits that caused his fall?"
His death also forced them to think about how to do their job and live.
Bohoku said, "They don't like you messing with their women and children, nor do they like you influencing their legitimate companies and their secret airports for the delivery of drugs.
They're all over their bottom line. "
The result is to maintain a high level of self-censorship and self-protection, even at the safest times.
Believe in your instincts.
If you smell dangerous, stay away.
Andres Villar, editor of Riodoce, said, "The problem is that breath is a sense of deception and then something like Javier happens."
He and others said that the previous rules were no longer applicable in Sinalo State — just as they were no longer applicable in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes were profitable, institutions were weak, government officials were corrupt, gassed.
The situation is changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees were trained in security, mobile phones were suddenly denied; a few days ago, spy software allegedly sold to the Government was used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen took the shade and escaped the high temperatures of 104 degrees.
They were sent by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-storey building in the Culiacan Middle Class neighbourhood.
Some journalists are jokingly saying they don't know if these cops belong to 50% of what the governor himself says.
Journalists have been in the mountains for months, where drug cartels are under real control.
This week's "Riodoce" featured three major events.
Among them was the murder of the brother of Julio César Chávez, a great former boxer in Sinaro.
And the Governor's home government funding disclosure.
And the kidnapping in an expensive restaurant in Culiacan, only a block from the prosecutor's office.
The authorities do not publish information about the victims and the process of kidnapping, so writing down what the city knows requires caution: the restaurant is the place where the drug dealers and the authorities love to go.
A journalist learned from a public file that the restaurant was registered by a politician of the ruling party, the Revolutionary System Party (PRI), who dominated the political class almost throughout the last chronology.
Recently, several Revolutionary System governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarill asked reporters to write about what happened at the place where it happened, including the case of a son of Mexico's biggest drug lord, Guzman, fleeing a military attack.
If a few months ago, the readers looked at Valdez's column and looked for the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
Forty-six-year-old Villarill was called "Skinny" because he was thin, and he said, "We knew what had happened before.
Now all our sources of information have been cut off.
Valdez's office is now being used to store logos and stickers to protest the killing of journalists, because the employees are what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a sign out of his room and went to the office of the local prosecutor to attend a demonstration in connection with another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacán in the west three days after Valdez was killed.
Officially found a burned body and claimed that according to DNA tests, this was his body.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal, organizing protests, using the word "Save the Media" on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, director Bohoque is not in Washington, and he's trying to get justice and international support for the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the official of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
Given that her anger has affected her objectivity, she has also asked to resign from reporting on government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are surrounded by organized crime, mixed-up government officials and indifferent societies.
In his last book, "Drug journalism", he wrote that journalists were not only murdered by drug cartels, but were also on the list of politicians and security forces who were complicit in organized crime.
Media Watch Group Articulo 19 blames police and public officials for more than half of last year's attacks on journalists.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up."
Apparently, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago the blogger Maria Elizabeth Matias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
There's a note next to her body, allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my report."
Her head was cut off with a computer keyboard and headphone next to it.
After Miroslava Blatch was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close down, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern frontier of Chihuahua.
The others are continuing. The board of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo was killed in 2014, but they're continuing.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke openly about the drug cartel in a front page, entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their homes or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and they need to be careful on the streets and watch out for danger.
Sometimes they'll be arrested, allegedly killed three months after the photographer Rubin Espinosa fled Veracruz, in a Mexican city with four women.
For those who stay behind, it's a routine step in high-risk decision-making.
Evara wanted to be a poet, and he admitted that reporting on the drug trade scared him.
He said, "Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
Last Friday, in the middle of the night, the latest edition of the newspaper was printed, and the editors of Riodoce sat out on the walkway and drank beer, and suddenly their phones were ringing.
There was a series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the beach resort city of Masatland, and 19 people were identified dead.
The war continues to escalate, as a series of cartel information found in the area suggests.
They're uploading the news to Riodoce on the side of the road.
The headlines of the next day had to be changed.
The sirens are ringing in the vicinity — there's another fight in the area.
Bohoque looked at the police officers standing there to see if they were alert.
If they're a little scared, they don't show up.
The founder of this newspaper has been killed, and in his large portrait, he points to a place where the whole of Sinaloa needs to look, and the entire staff of Riodoce follows his pace.
Bohoque said, "How can you even want to shut it down? The same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street to cover it."
China's auto-drive tourism market size by 2020 or exceeding trillion yuan
[Summary] In the context of the escalation of consumption and the prevalence of free trade, self-drive is encouraged by national policies and increasingly popular with consumers.
But at the same time, there is a double challenge for a self-drive market that is expected to reach hundreds of millions.
Against the backdrop of rising consumption and the prevalence of free trade, self-drive is encouraged by national policies and increasingly popular with consumers.
At the same time, however, self-drive markets, which are expected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars, face the dual challenge of developing a self-drive industry that is not commensurate with market demand, and self-driving organizers, such as self-drive clubs and travel agencies, face a low-profit dilemma; on the other hand, infrastructure and services for self-driving are at an early stage.
60 per cent of the country's population. Market size is expected to break trillions of dollars.
In 2016, 4,44 million domestic trips took place, with self-travel accounting for about 60 per cent of the country ' s total tourism, and the size of the self-travel market is expected to exceed trillions by 2020.
According to the statistics of the Chinese Tourist Association on the number of people travelling on their own, the number of people travelling has continued to grow over the past five years, and the proportion of tourists travelling in the country has stabilized at more than half.
At the same time, there has been increased attention and support at the regional and national levels for the emerging area of self-driving, with intensive policy and regulatory work from 2016 to 2017 in relation to self-driving, caravans and camping tourism.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourist Board and the National Sports Directorate, jointly issued the Automobile Sports Camp Development Plan; in the same month, self-driving was highlighted in the Action Programme for Upgrading the Upgrading of Rural Tourism Development (2017), jointly issued by 14 departments, including the CDRC, the Ministry of Finance and others.
The introduction of policies provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-drives.
Self-drive clubs are not very profitable. The whole chain is the key.
Although domestic self-drive markets have great potential and national policies have been actively directed, the self-drive industry is still in its infancy.
According to China's Annual Development Report for Self-Drive 2016-2017, there are thousands of self-drive clubs, auto clubs, car clubs, etc. in China, but the proportion of tourists who make self-help arrangements for self-drives accounts for the majority, and only about 15 per cent of visitors from various agencies such as the Auto-Drive Clubs.
At the same time, there are only a few online tourism businesses and traditional travel agencies that develop their own free-drive products, and many online tourism platforms sell only self-drive products from suppliers, and some self-drive clubs are important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-drive activities, it covers "eat, live, walk, swim, buy, entertain" in many ways, with a high degree of fragmentation, a heavy upstream supply chain and a high level of random tourism consumption.
The founder of the Beijing Automobile Club and CEO Lee Chongjie considered the self-drive club to be essentially similar to the travel agency, with the early dominant profit model based on sub-linear activities, with the core focus on self-drive line products and lead service.
But now there is a high degree of homogenization of line products in the self-drive sector, with uneven levels of service and the need for a new transformation of the self-drive club.
As can be seen, self-drive is not an independent industry in itself, but rather forms a trans-territorial, industry-based ecosystem that forms a complete industrial chain.
Experts pointed out that beyond basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important element of consumption.
Therefore, for the development of the self-drive industry, experience characteristics should be enhanced, the theme of "self-drive plus" should be developed, and the IP of the self-driving product.
The view road is not just a road. Car camps should not be just room and board.
In the face of self-drive, the basic development of self-drive is also relatively basic.
Li Chong Jie points out that tourism landscapes are not just a road, but involve the integration of the elements of transport and tourism, but that the construction of roads and tourism itself is the responsibility of both departments, and that the transport sector has added tourism elements and is still involved in the construction of facilities such as latrines, counselling centres, information boards, etc., which are not very well integrated with tourism.
The experience of construction is worth learning in comparison to the well-known self-drive route of American Route 66.
The design of the landscape is no longer the most direct and fast route between departure and destination, but rather follows the design concept of "exhausting the joy of driving" and provides the best enjoyment for self-driving tourists to enjoy the beauty of the road; the landscape can link points and faces to the tourist landscape, preserving the historical and cultural value of ecotourism resources along the route, and organizing thematic events to enhance the participation and experience of tourists and create economic benefits for local tourism.
In addition to the viewing lane, the camp is an important complement to self-drive.
However, among the tourists who are known by the reporters of the New Kyoto newspaper, few consumers choose to stay in the camp.
In their view, many camps tend to be infrastructure-oriented and serve only food, low grades, single products, and do not meet the many elements of self-drive.
According to industry sources who do not want to reveal their names, many of the enterprises that had been camping in previous years had gone to land, after which the infrastructure and services that had accompanied them had not been kept up, many of the operations had been in deficit, and without a later infusion of funds, it had been difficult to make some of the accompanying products.
Consumption group
According to data published in 2017 by the Chinese Association of Tour Operators, the self-drive population is concentrated in the 21-40 age group, mainly in the 31-40 age group, which has a certain economic base and is in high demand for personalized tourism, mostly by parent-to-child clients.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-drive population has a relatively higher preference for non-standard accommodation.
In terms of the type of self-drive, peri-drive is the predominant type of self-drive, accounting for 84.32 per cent.
A lot of people want to leave the country, but it's a smaller share.
At the same time, as consumer demand rose, tourists who used to drive their own tours began to change their mind, instead of taking pictures and sleeping in their own cars, they focused more on the experience and the process of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguise to hide from their enemies.
At first glance, it's scary, but it looks like a statue.
The researchers published their first research on the incredible biochemicals discovered by Canadian miners, the size of a rhinoceros, indicating that the fossils were well preserved, so the experts called it "Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world".
It's very well preserved, and it can even be concluded that the colour of its scab skin is red brown, which means it's had some "fearful experience."
It's described in the "Contemporary Biology" magazine as "one of the world's best dinosaurs ever found in the best preservation of the capicorn."
The fossils are a newly discovered species of cyanide that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the circulatory era.
It's in perfect condition and shocked the researchers, who described it as "unbelievable."
According to the National Geographic Journal, this herbivorous capicorn dinosaur is the most preserved of its kind ever discovered.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered this fossil when he was mining at the Senkor Millennium mine near McMurryburg, north of Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he came across something that didn't seem like the rocks around him, and he decided to take a closer look.
Then the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Tyrell Biological Museum of Canada.
It took six years for the researchers to show the true face of this beast hidden inside the soil of 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).
After all this hard work, the final results are now published.
"If you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping," says Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrell Museum.
"it will be one of the most beautiful and preserved specimens in the history of science -- the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world. "
By studying their skin, researchers have found that this herbivorous creature, wearing armor, is likely to face a major threat from predators.
A dinosaur in a heavy armor used red and white to hide from predators and to use a covert technique known as "backshade," which was also used by many modern animals.
In this way, experts say, it can be better integrated with the surrounding environment, thus avoiding the enemy, which suggests that it is preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
This is a 110 million-year-old creature that belongs to the Yuzhmorgeologiya family, which became the headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrell Biological Museum.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was a member of the team, spent 700 hours carefully unmasking the beast's veil, and the researchers now researched it and named it "Borealopelta markmitchelli".
The sample is extremely well preserved, so that Dr. Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists, can record the pattern and shape of the scales and armour on their bodies.
They found the anti-shade, which is a common defense in the animal world, which means that the back of the creature is darker than the color of its side.
Although anti-shade technique is common, the discovery is surprising, because the dinosaur is much larger in size than the existing animals that use anti-shade.
Such dinosaurs are under pressure to be hunted by predators, and thus evolve in a favourable direction, enabling them to hide in the stories as a means of survival.
But the fact that most of the animals that exist that use anti-shadows, such as deer, zebra or Zebra, are as small and fragile as prey suggests that the creature is under real survival pressure.
"The wild predators of the Big Heavy Meal dinosaurs show how dangerous the meat-eating dinosaurs are." Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin color of the dinosaur is red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life clues of the creature, including its retained stomach contents, to find the last food to feed.
They believe that the dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death and were then washed into the sea and then sunk to the sea with their backs down.
At that time, Alberta's climate was as warm as today's climate in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans could be deeper inland than they are today.
Brown said, "This is truly amazing, because it is completely covered by the skin of its skin, which is preserved in space, so that its original shape can be preserved. "
"So the creature is now in almost the same shape as it was in the circa.
You don't have to use too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping. "
The era of the white chrysanthemum is the time when the two-footed giant foot dinosaurs roam the Earth.
Although the Tyrannosaurus is the king of the dinosaurs, it appears millions of years after the cape dinosaurs, who may have been captured and killed by some of their ancestors.
They include high-strength dragons, a giant beast weighing 6 tons, 38 feet (11.5 metres).
Recent studies have found that scientists in the journal Contemporary Biology believe that the mausoleum died and washed into the sea, and then formed mummies in the dirt.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink dug up the creature at the Millennium mine near McMurryburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it's the world's best preserved coated dinosaur, full of skin and armor from the nose to the buttocks.
On average, this creature is about 18 feet long (5 m) and weighs 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It's got two 20 inches long, tipping up from the shoulder.
According to researchers, this herbivorous capricorn is now active in the western part of Canada and is then washed into the sea by a flood of rivers.
But these dinosaurs are buried beneath the sea floor, keeping their capes intact.
The fossil remains of this particular sample are well preserved so that the remaining skin is still covered with unsatisfied diamonds on the skull of dinosaurs.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, this level of preservation is as rare as winning.
The more I look at it, the more I think it's incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered in the caps of the dinosaur skull.
Its right front hand is on its side, five toes up.
I can count it. "
Journalists have learned that adding sea algae acid, corrosive acid and amino acid efficiency vehicles from natural or plant sources to urea production processes can modify the efficiency of traditional urea, resulting in urea algae urea, zinc urea, and a 5-10 percentage point increase in the utilization of urea urea by grain urea compared to normal urea.
Environmentalally friendly, the potential for increased crop production is evident, especially for urea added by large particles, which is a quality raw material for BB fertilizer.
This total number of security personnel is twice as high as the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympic Games.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Games, Brazil will launch the largest security linkage in history.
Previously, the Brazilian Government indicated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and police, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 police, would join forces.
Most of the troops will be responsible for the protection of the Olympic stadium, while the 3,000 additional troops will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets.
The police patrol the rest of the city, including the subway, bus and streets.
According to the information received, 6,000 troops have arrived in Rio for Olympic security.
They are responsible for patrolling the airport and the main road connecting the airport to the Olympic stadium, in addition to the four main areas of the Rio Olympics.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service industry is no longer new, and it is important to make them more effective and not more formal.
How do radicals learn to answer the question: "Who's street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was troubled.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis man sat in a rented bed with Abby and looked at Facebook on his cell phone.
She happened to find a high schooler's post.
It says, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid who was lying on the street."
She found no one else on the feed, and she was confused. She turned off Facebook, turned on Twitter.
A @TheePharaah user keeps sending her the Dynamic Times.
Michael Brown, an unarmed, 18-year-old black man, was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He put a picture of Brown's body lying down on the street, and his body lying down on the street for four hours.
"Crazy," Ferrer thought.
But death is not new to her and her community.
She dropped her phone until the same night she turned on Twitter again, reading tweets about the gathering of people on Campfield Avenue.
There's a police video and a photo of people screaming, and there's a picture of a man who calls himself Brown's father, and it says, "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed from a policeman standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
She said that in another video, another policeman raised his rifle screaming: "I will kill all of you... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrer recalled.
"This is not what we used to call a classic murder. "
At that moment, I felt so chilly.
I'm angry, I'm crying. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary film "Who's Street"?
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of the people who live in this community, crowded in the streets, demanding answers.
When Ferrer and her daughter drove to Ferguson, they reopened the topic that they had discussed a million times before that morning: "The Black Experience and the Black Situation."
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people had to fight for their faith?" She remembered.
"We're going to Ferguson now, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, it's not right.
I had to take her with me, "After Ferrer, say it.
"What happens today is the culmination of everything that has happened in the past.
She needs to know, to see and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop well in radicalism and organization, but also to understand the different dimensions of black experience and the situation of black people and what we have to do to achieve freedom and liberation.
Even if I had the privilege of giving her a racist experience she had not experienced personally, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this case, I think I'm hurting her. "
They arrived at the first stop of Ferguson at a site opposite the South Florence police station, which became their camp when the radicals waited for the result of the eventual non-prosecution of police officer Darren Wilson.
Ferrer and her daughter were in contact with a local business owner who made a bag full of lunch.
They've prepared a bag to deliver it to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to develop a new kind of activism.
She said, "My radicalism changed completely after August 9th." When she was studying undergraduate at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Minority Nurses, focusing on the food justice and health gap in the black community.
"I have no organizational experience.
That's how it's all coming. "
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the film co-director Sabah Foleyan during a night march.
Freiyan said that she and her photographer Lucas Alvarado Faller "just wanted to record what happened.
There's a question in Ferrer's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many cases in which people -- usually white -- enter a community to benefit from their pain and resilience.
As Freiyan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the native people of Ferguson did not concentrate their voices, and we wanted to do it differently. "
Freiyan has contacted co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for radicalism against prisoners on death row.
His involvement brought Ferrer together with six other locals to join the "Who's Street?" project team, which remained in place for several years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary is not about talking to us or talking to us. This is our statement. Davis says...
"I'm primarily concerned about how these characters are presented, because that's how I'm presented. "
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrer's experience -- it's to show that the campaign's not about the Savior's leader, it's about community cohesion, Freiyan says -- it turns out she's the most open of film participants.
And as a result, "Who's Street?" was a surprising recording of Ferrer's personal life, like falling in love and getting married.
"I feel naked," Ferrer laughed the first time he saw the finished product.
"But I understand that doing this job and humanizing blacks requires a certain degree of vulnerability... "
In addition, Ferrer's story reaffirms and repositions the role of black cool women in the wider black life event movement.
Two of the three founders of the campaign -- created #BlackLivesMatter in social media after the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trevor Martin -- were identified as Cool.
"The black cool women in the leadership generally support this movement," Ferrer said, "That's because we're fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to bear all this. "
Freiyan agrees and says, "This movement is really supported by black women and many black and cool women."
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen to be the center of the film.
"She's the one who inspires this energy," she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence... because you have a lot to do as a black cool woman in these crossroads.
You can feel her energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long disappeared, but ethnic tensions between the community and the police persist.
Ferrer was given a suspended sentence of more than two and a half years for attempting to block the highway during a parade.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home: "It's a mess."
Despite all this, she's been holding on to the sacred song she tried to remember since she went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"We have a duty to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We can't lose any more, except the shackles on our bodies. "
In fact, an online translation service was available 10 years ago, and it was a long time ago that the argument that machines were about to replace humans in translation was not overheard.
Similarity: Artists use Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits.
There are multiple faces in the middle of the Freedman Museum in New York: white, black and brown, with almost undetectable similarities between each face, and these faces are tied by a line from the ceiling.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning's cheeks and hair chips.
Manning sent hair shreds from Livingworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment for leaking confidential diplomatic cables via WikiLeaks website.
The exhibit was opened on August 2nd under the title "Systems".
This was the result of two years of communications between Dewey Hagberg and Manning, who combined their disciplines with theirs in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a well-known dissident who had been imprisoned and had completed a sex-transformation operation in prison.
By analysing algorithms from Manning's DNA, and by creating 30 portraits of the very likely appearance, Heather Dewey Haborg made an incisive and somewhat inexorable comment, both about the ambivalence of DNA and about the concept of identity itself.
Manning was born under the name Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted that he was a woman at puberty... and was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including 6 espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photograph, a photo of herself with a platinum sense of black and white, apparently uneasy, sitting on the driver's seat, wearing platinum-colour wigs.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Haborg made great success in her 2012 project "Stranger Visas."
In that work, she used evidence from the middle court of smoke and gum, DNA from the scraps, creating a portrait of a possibly similar 3D character.
That's an e-mail she just got from the PaperSmart magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison, and they need a photo " , Hesseldwey Haborg told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning was unable to visit and photograph, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
So the artist and her jailed Muse became the impossible pen pals who exchanged letters with each other in two years.
They even created a comic book, "The Repressive Headshot," by Shoili Kanungo, which foresees that the President will grant Manning privileges in the future and that she will be able to see the exhibition in prison.
It may be a coincidence that Manning spent his seventh year in Kansas Military Prison.
In addition, there is a different meaning to this exhibition, which is designed to bridge the current United States, where the Trump government continues to declare war against government leakers and transgender soldiers, while at the same time looking for new ways in which it can be tweaked on Twitter.
When asked about all this special occasion, Heather Dewey Haborg said, "Anything happens for a reason."
In the artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning's super-size signature is below, calling for an end to the "gender, sexual orientation, and cultural-based party struggle."
On the other side of the wall is her lined particle DNA sequence, with pencil twists and twists written with Cs, Gs and As symbols.
By including 200 letters (or nucleic acid, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Dewey Haborg wants to express, at least in terms of physiological structure, the same for everyone by drawing these strangely similar portraits.
"I hope people get out of this, our genome doesn't care who we are, how the open genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is." Hesseldwey Haborg said his 2007 video, "Falsory Memory", was also shown.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so here's 30 of them. "
The last piece in the exhibition, in a room, came from a page in a novel in the previous illustration.
It shows how American soldiers are exaggerating under their loudspeakers, the Mannings of the King Kong.
"When they stop your speech, they win." It says on the wall.
"So don't shut up."
"This came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm just afraid again, and I'm still going to say it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition herself, as foreseen in the comic book, but when she does, she'll get cheers from her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters at the center of the gallery.
It's also purposeful, just like all the objects in the exhibition, to reach the height of her monogamous genetic information with pencils.
"I used to hang them on the wall, but I hope they feel like a bunch of people." Dewey Hagburg, talking about portraits, said.
"But I want them to feel like a bunch of protesters who followed Chelsea, just as people were protesting her release. "
Northwestern professor and Oxford staff are wanted for homicide.
According to the police, a man was found fatally stabbed in a fancy apartment in Chicago, and a Northwestern university professor and an Oxford university employee were subsequently wanted and are currently looking for suspects throughout the country.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Windham Lacem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested and arrested without bail on charges of the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Durrano.
According to the records, 26-year-old Connell Durrano died as a result of multiple stab wounds.
The Chicago Police Department issued a community alert that the body was found on July 27th.
The police arrived at Grand Plaza's apartment on the phone and found multiple fractures on the victim's body.
Police say Cornell Durrano died instantly, the detective is investigating the murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Laisem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, Alan K. Kobitch, Deputy Chief of Campus Relations, stated that Lesem is now separated and has been banned from the Northwestern University campus.
Kobaki said, " This is a criminal case, the authorities are investigating it, and Northwestern University is actively cooperating in the investigation. "
Warren was a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
In his e-mail statement, the spokesman for the Summerville College at Oxford University stated: "We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist the United States investigative agencies as needed. "
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Gullermi, Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, strongly encouraged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Gullermi said, "The police have a general idea of their whereabouts, and we're trying to locate the possible location. "
Gullermi stated that local, regional and national authorities were doing their utmost to assist in the search for suspects.
Gullermi said the police had received a call from the manager of Grand Plaza's apartment, and he had just received a secret tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police said it was terrible.
Gullermi says it is still unclear whether this incident also occurred on July 27th.
He said that security cameras had confirmed that Lacem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Lacem has some connection to the victim," Gullerme said.
Grand Plaza ' s management team issued a statement to the residents stating: " The police are currently investigating the victim ' s timing and background, and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident. "
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said, "We will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency Road Map in the near future."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko stated that it would not take too long to implement the remaining standards for restoring the rights of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"The implementation of the road map standards has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard.
Deputy Prime Minister Muteko, commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency road map, "Observance", stated that this part set out the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and had recently been posted on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the criteria do not contain anything that might cause concern in Russia.
He added, "All has to be announced, everything will be implemented.
The results will be submitted to the IOC [IOC] and WADA. "
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that the Russian anti-doping agency must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard Macallan on the WADA case of Russian State support for the use of doping in national sports.
Turning to the matter, Mutko said, "We're investigating, our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not recognize what does not exist. "
Muttko responded to Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with the media earlier that day, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of the Russian anti-doping agency in the past, but he added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one planned to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnov said.
After the November 2015 stimulant scandal, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to carry out stimulant checks in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director General Olivia Negri, during his visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, stated that RUSADA was "going in the right direction" and trying to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it's a checker or a national chess game, defeating the human race was off limits decades ago.
The President of the Croatian Football Association, Davo-Suk, said in an interview that it was very interesting to be in the Chinese Cup, and that the prizes were very large.
There's no need to replace them anymore! The 8,000 products are zero-tariff.
At a regular press conference organized by the Ministry of Commerce on 11 January, the Press Spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce indicated that, to date, 15 of the FTAs in force in our country cover 23 countries and territories, covering more than 8,000 duty-free imports.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, ASEAN tropical fruits... you don't need to buy these at great cost.
Currently, our country has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and territories, and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 duty-free imports.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers are able to taste agricultural products of good quality and affordable quality from different production sites every four season.
For example, in the case of tropical fruits such as guacamole, guacamole and dragon nuts in ASEAN, import duties were reduced from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
The import duty for Icelandic salmon was reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
In the case of red wine in Georgia and Chile, the import duty was reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
And New Zealand's specialty agricultural products, such as beef and milk powder, all have substantial tax cuts.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, the import duty on some cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero;
(b) The duty on some watch imports has been reduced by 50 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
Import duties on products such as refrigerators, cookers, massage machines and beauty parlour were reduced by 40 per cent in Korea and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
There's a lot of tax cuts on consumer electronics.
At the same time, zero-tariff products under the FTA also include many intermediates and raw materials required for the manufacture of domestic end-of-pipe consumer goods, which also contributes, to some extent, to the structural upgrading of domestically produced consumer goods.
The press spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce stated that nearly one third of the country ' s total imports were subject to preferential FTA tariffs, most of which were end consumer goods, with tangible benefits for consumers.
Further reduction of tariffs on imports of consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, customs duties have been adjusted for the import of certain consumer goods, further reducing tariffs on consumer goods, covering food, health, medicines, solar products, clothing and footwear caps, household equipment, cultural entertainment, and daily department goods, totalling 187 eight-digit tariff numbers.
The average tax rate on consumer goods will be reduced from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost "cut off"!
Since 1 January 2018, we have also made partial adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
The import duty on partial cosmetics, such as lipstick, eye shadows and perfumes, was reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
Lowering tariffs means consumers don't buy substitute products, much less go abroad to buy preferred foreign products.
Yen2018 Import Trade Festival: Importing wine, snacks, fruit... is cheap!
Extrapolation: U.S. malls at the end of the year have very different rules.
On December 29th, Chinanet.
According to the U.S. World Daily, just after Christmas, there's a drop-back.
According to ABC, more than half of the goods sold last Christmas were re-exported.
In addition, readers have been tricked on many occasions, and consumers need to be careful when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable procedures for the return of goods, but when buying gifts or electricians from small shops, care must be taken.
On December 1st, Ms. Haugh from Rolandon bought a jacket at a local shop that specializes in printing jackets, and it's still not mailed.
She e-mailed the client and didn't reply.
There were reports from other people who went to the United States last year to buy a cell phone from a third-party seller and sent it in a box of rubber mud.
If you know you're being cheated, you can apply for a refund to the website and get a full refund.
But there are customers who think that the website's refund service is not 100% perfect.
A Chinese resident from Northern California said that he had bought two rush distributions for a website, four times an emergency service, but both times they didn't arrive on time.
Then I applied for a refund, and I didn't get a response.
Large malls and shopping malls have a better return policy.
Macy's is a full refund for most commodities within 180 days.
But the goods must remain "old" and must have a purchase certificate such as a receipt or a bank purchase record.
In the absence of a certificate, the customer can also obtain a mall score, which can be used to purchase other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day deadline for the return of goods, and electronics usually have 15 days.
However, electronics were purchased between 1 November and 25 December 2017, and the return period for entertainment-type goods was extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period begins on December 25th, i.e. by January 25th, 2018.
It's a great shopping experience. A new era of shopping in the business world.
More than a decade ago, our country was generally in the seller's market, with limited choices and limited demand.
But after a decade of development, the market has been transformed from a seller's to a buyer's market, and today the taste of consumers has become even worse, and they are no longer content with a simple "pay and deliver" shopping.
So, how to give consumers an extraordinary shopping experience becomes the next point of competition for real estate developers.
Of the many factors that affect the consumer's shopping experience, shopping malls in the business world are the most important.
See how city builders around the world focus on shopping experiences.
There aren't two identical leaves in the world, let alone two identical shopping centres, a famous shopping centre necessarily has its own features.
The famous Kanyon shopping mall in Turkey, with its unique wave-shaped architectural inspiration coming from the Canyon, is called the Harmonious Kanyon, and walks 200 metres of the Minister's walk inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon design, there is a large elliptical show in the center of the shopping mall, with unique appearances, often featuring performances.
Because of the open platform design, tourists are able to look down at what's going on in the Canyon at every level and have the effect of changing the scenery.
Domestically, the Nanjing Forest Moor Commercial Street, known as China's first forest-style stroller, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
700 m2 Green Square, 3,000 m2 roofing water platform. The project consists of nine mono-structures, which connect the air corridors between the buildings and are designed for the entire sinking courtyard, with the French tree above the surface of the surface, roofing water ceilings, creating a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest of Moore, it's like falling into a rabbit hole in Alice's mind, climbing along a trunk that surrounds buildings, grasses, springs, and brings people into a forest full of life and energy.
Also in Chongqing, the Lok Lok Rikaham Circle of Waterworks, plans for a 100-dollar business, plans for the future introduction of more than 50 international top-class flagships, over 100 international top brands and more than 500 well-known national and foreign brands, to become a cluster of service industries with well-focused business centres.
In addition, the Rigabin business circle integrates ecology into buildings, guided by TOD public transport, fashion shopping, living services, catering, entertainment, education, sports, and brings together consumers with their experiences of shopping, while at the same time leading them to the Chongqing unique "coastal culture", integrating shopping with water entertainment and recreation.
As a whole, it can be seen that, at present, part of the housing stock has learned the trajectories of this new urban business, and industry has indicated that this consumption pattern, which is centred on consumer experience, will also mainstream future urban development by combining shopping and experience.
The business world today is not just a mass of goods, it's more a place to integrate art and culture, a place to combine creative themes, and it also carries responsibility for urban residence.
So while meeting the consumer ' s need to eat, drink and buy one-stop materials, maximizing the multi-layered spiritual need to transmit culture and art and taking advantage of the liveable need is necessarily the high point for the future development of the business community.
In Chongqing, the north bank of the country is located in the north of the river, close to the sound bridge, the world's best business, the world's big, the world's big, the world's big, the world's big, the world's big, the world's big, the world's big, the world's big, the world's big.
It's a beautiful place to walk, and it's a world of beauty.
Eufornia has a better shopping environment, and Eufornia's proximity to the South Lawn Business Circle, with its exclusive access to the West and even the nation's leading four-tiered transportation system, has improved the comfort of shopping.
In addition, the gardens on the two walking streets of Wanda Square were greenened, the landscape floor was upgraded, about 300 pieces of wood were planted, 40,000 square metres were resurfaced, and the image of the South Lawn business was enhanced;
The first low-density ripples of Loch Loch No. 1, near Chongqing, surrounded by nine parks, low-density commercial neighbourhoods and high openness, made people more willing to stay and stay and enjoy the pleasures of shopping rather than rushing forward by the people in the back.
Today's commercial competition will only increase, and how to kill a bloodbath in a highly homogenous market that will win the reputation of shopping grounds in the hearts of future consumers deserves serious consideration by all real estate developers.
Differential strategies alone are not enough. Only developers who really put consumers in their hearts, rush consumers, think consumers, and offer consumers a very simple shopping experience can laugh at the storm's coming markets.
Of course, at the end of the day, I think the happy people of Chongqing have such good shopping experiences and business circles that no one could imagine today's prosperity 10 years ago.
Festivals: consumerist carnivals mask real environmental prices
$16.8 billion, which is the amount of the deal consumed by Skycat users within 24 hours of November 11th, 2017.
Specifically, after the start of the double 11s, it's only three minutes before it's over $10 billion, more than $20 billion in 6 minutes and 05 seconds, and more than $100 billion in 9 hours.
This day, the total number of payments made by global consumers through the payment of treasures reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over last year.
This consumption will result in 812 million logistics orders.
And whether Skycats buy platforms or pay for them, they belong to the Ali Group in Mayun.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that on November 11th, a single young man's self-scribbling "Smoking Stick Festival" subculture would be compiled by the electrician and become today's phenomenon-class "two-Eleven" shopping carnival.
On November 11, 2009, for the first time ever, Ali Baba used the marketing head of "Shot Sticks": No one's in love with you, so come and get them online.
It turned out to be a surprise that the deal was over $52 million, 10 times the amount of the day-to-day deal.
Since then, Double 11 has been a shopping carnival created by Ali Baba, and nine years have passed since the arrival of domestic buyers to entertain themselves, and nine years have passed since Skycat's 1,100 billion was over 3200 times as high as that year's Black Friday.
There's a lot of electricians who sell it with Windy Cat.
"Kyodong" has its own shopping festival, "6.18", but without the impact of "two 11", the cumulative sales of "Kyoto" from November 1st to November 11th reached $1271 billion.
And after the "two 11s," it's just like the "two 12s" party, Christmas New Year's shopping slot.
After New Year's, there's Chinese consumers waiting for the annual purchase slot before Spring Festival, the Valentine's Shopping slot, the consumption, and no vacation.
Environmental problems caused by instant mass consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua daily telecommunications reports, a conservative estimate based on the normal standard of 0.2 kg per box in the industry is that at least 300,000 tons of waste was generated during this year's "two eleventh" period.
The director of the Pollution Prevention and Control Project of the East Asia Division for Greenpeace, Liu Wah, told the dialogue that this year's double 11 order would generate 160,000 tons of packaged garbage.
In 2016, the National Post Office issued a report indicating that the volume of fast packages for 2015 during the "two eleventh" period (11-16 November) was about 780 million, using more than 3 billion knitted bags, 9,922 million boxes, 16,985 million duct tape, and tape lengths can orbit the Earth's equator 425 laps.
And this year, the National Post Office predicts that the number of double 11s is expected to exceed 1.5 billion.
Wang, manager of a waste burning centre in Beijing, told Xinhua that the amount of garbage entering the yard every day after Double 11 exceeded 2,000 tons and exceeded the capacity of the disposal station.
The express delivery company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry cannot be underestimated.
Some electric operators, including Sunin, have introduced recycled reusable plastic delivery boxes, recycled as shopping bags and garbage bags, and so on, but troublesome consumers are less receptive.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" in Twitter.
This microblogging yielded more than 68,000 "sweet."
What kind of mobile payment do the Germans want?
Zhang Dong Fong: The mobile payment battle in Germany is not expected.
We believe that the payment and the payment of the treasure have only moved the battlefield to Europe, that the rivals have remained the same, and that the taking of positions has not changed — the Chinese — is globalization?
Where there's money, there's money.
In accordance with the agreement with Wirecard, a German electronic payment service provider, Wesson formally started landing in Germany in November this year, and gradually set up a European-wide arrangement.
This time, the two "olds" are back in Europe.
It's been a long time since the payment of treasures and micro-credits was on the road to globalization.
With regard to the globalization of mobile payments in China, the Iri Consulting "China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Study 2017" concludes that there are two types of projects: strategic investment, empirical output, equity entry, and support for local mobile payment enterprises abroad.
The second is the promotion of mobile payment services to foreign businesses through the consumption behaviour of Chinese tourists abroad, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of China ' s mobile payments by foreign countries.
It's true, the Chinese have to be the best.
China's rapid economic growth, combined with a large population base, has made the spending of Chinese tourists in Europe an attractive figure.
But it's also fated that this Chinese mobile payment battle in Germany is unforeseeable.
Is it globalization that we have to pay and pay the treasures but to move the battlefield to Europe, where the competitors remain the same, or where the positions are seized — the Chinese or the Chinese?
More groundbreaking is the question of whether China ' s mobile payments can expand its territory on its own soil.
Take Germany, for example.
"New retail" with magic.
Chen, Yang Kai-han: Amazon announced his entry to military bookstores and groceries as he crowded into the world's top 10 retailers, both timing and motivations were interesting.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookshop in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened a shop in New York and planned to own at least eight by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, Amazon announced that the store would be run on a trial basis, that the customers would not have to wait in line, that they would not have to close the books, that they would have to go through the door code, that they would have to take the goods they wanted and that the purchases would automatically be deducted from the customers' Amazon account.
As far as the Amazon is concerned, it's been an unexpected thing in recent years to move on to a real store.
Because, as early as 2007, in an "open letter to shareholders", CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized that Amazons would not open physical shops easily unless the following four conditions were met simultaneously:
1. We must be convinced that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investments;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great significance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4. We must be sure that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differentiation ...
Bookshops and groceries are the most rocky classification in both entity retail and the first rival to fall after the rise of the Amazon.
Amazon announced that he would march into two of the world's top 10 retailers, both of which are interesting in terms of timing and motivation.
Is the Amazon ' s approach contrary to the guarantees contained in the shareholders ' letters?
On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunming Congress, Chairman Ma Yun of the Ali Baba Board gave a keynote address.
He said, "From next year, Ali Baba will stop talking about e-commerce.
The era of pure electricians will soon come to an end, and in the next decade, 20 years there will be no e-commerce, replaced by “new retailing”.
A combination of offline and logistics leads to new retail sales ... "
At one point, the word "new retail" was like magic, and people were always talking about it.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
If it's just a line-to-line combination, it's not new.
In 2016, eMarketer followed 180 of the largest generators, estimated that their total sales amounted to about $200 billion, of which the top 25 accounted for more than $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers that only started operating online in the last five years (Mexi's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And the 28.3 billion dollars of the Ali Baba Group in the Suning Yun business are still on the map.
Globally, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to a full-source retail system covering physical stores, electricians, mobile and socialized media.
Is Mavanti's "new retail" more a wrap-up than a vision for the future?
If not, what's the difference between the whole-channel concept and "new retail"?
Perhaps the question is not whether or not to merge online and underground, but how to integrate.
Looking back at the last 20 years of retailing, the rise of electric generators, like the rise of early discount retailers, has focused on prices and convenience.
With these two pain spots, electricians move very standardized products, such as books and CDs, down the line.
With the growth of online consumption habits and the growing experience of customers, the electrician reaches out to other classes and starts to improve efficiency.
In the words of Zhang Yong, " using the ideas and technologies of the Internet to overhaul and upgrade the existing stock of about 30 trillion social retailers, the rising consumer demand in China can be effectively met, making the entire production and circulation of goods and services more efficient because of the Internet and the widespread use of big data ... "
So the electrician's path is a path of light assets, real heavy assets.
The term "light" refers to fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc., which are not burdened by traditional retail trade; the term "heavy" refers to the need for huge inputs in logistics, warehousing, etc.
The change in logistics ensures the efficiency of the electrician.
According to the Chinese Government, Premier Li Keqiang chaired the Standing Meeting of the State Council on 28 April, which concluded that the expansion of domestic consumption demand was an important step towards steady growth and structural adjustment.

On 18 January, in Chongqing, Ali Baba convened the Electro-Communicators Poverty Eradication Summit Dialogue, which announced the promotion of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization through the exploration of a new model of Internet+ Poverty Eradication.
This is after the launch of the Rural Strategy, the launch of the Rural Treasures Project, the launching of the anti-poverty platform, and the creation of the Ali Baba Fund for the Eradication of Poverty, Ali's renewed "plus" campaign against poverty.
The fight against poverty is one of China's most important national strategies now.
A complete eradication of poverty has never been achieved in China for thousands of years.
"Preventing poverty among electricians is an innovation in a new round of pro-poor development and an important player in achieving accurate poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation.
The Centre attaches great importance to the role that the Internet can play in helping to lift out poverty, promoting accurate poverty alleviation, enabling agricultural products to move out of the countryside through the Internet ... "
As a result, as early as 2014, Ali proposed a rural strategy that, along with big data cloud computing and globalization, is listed as the three core strategies of Ali for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the rural treasure-hunting project, recruiting "Village Two" in the countryside to lead farmers out of poverty through electric operators.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to create a channel for pro-poor farmers, which now covers 13 provinces across the country and 120 poor counties at the national level.
There are 2118 treasure-hunting villages on the Ali platform.
Of these, nearly 400 were found in poor districts in provinces and 33 in poor districts in 13 countries.
In 2017, the sale of the country's Treasure Village reached $120 billion on the Ali Baba Chinese retail platform.
Zhang Yong stated that, in the face of a strong national strategy to combat poverty, Ali had been thinking about how to find a new way out of poverty using the technological and technological capabilities of the Ali economy, big data, cloud computing, etc.
Among them, village pugs are the main carrying platform for Ali electric operators to lift themselves out of poverty and walk through a new chain of Internet access for direct marketing.
In the planting chain, village poachers and ants gold suits combine to support farming tools and microcredits.
In 2017, out of 832 poor counties at the national level, 795 ants gold suits were provided with easy payment, credit, etc.
Greenbirds solve storage and logistics, Skycats sell, Aliyun's big data feed guides agricultural production and further improves the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of the electrician out of poverty requires not only products, marketing corridors, industrial planning, but also human resources.
Ali, through the University of Questing, has taught farmers standardized, qualitative and scalable methods of growing, a combination of pro-poor and pro-braining skills has been achieved to lift farmers out of poverty in a sustainable manner.
These courses have covered about 92 per cent of poor counties at the national level.
And the idea of a "good mind, business" out of poverty also guarantees that Ali can be really poor in poverty alleviation.
Ma Yun, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ali Baba, has said that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and wealth creation.
Poverty reduction is the teaching of fish, poverty alleviation is the teaching of fish, wealth is the making of a fish pond for farmers, and the giving of fish to farmers.
Power-driven industries that are pro-poor are fish ponds.
In terms of industrial poverty reduction, the Lochuan Apple model, developed by Ali in partnership with Shaan Shilokawa, has been replicated nationally as an example.
Ali's pro-poor work has also been recognized at the decision-making level.
The electricity company, represented by Ali Baba, was sent a message to ensure that farmers increased their incomes through online and offline channels.
Some of the village's minions and ants' gold suits were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experiences of the electrician out of poverty.
At the moment, the China office of the World Food Programme has been working with villages to reduce poverty in the electric industry in places like Anhui.
Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of Electronic Commerce, Ministry of Commerce, attended and spoke on January 16 at the Third Congress of New Economic Think Tanks, co-organized by the Ali Institute and China's Visionary Think Tank Forum.
She believes that the most important issues of our globalization are the nature and use of globalization and the stages of globalization.
So many people think that globalization is stagnating and that many developed and developing countries, in a new phase, have different attitudes to globalization and different patterns.
The second concept is the issue of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
The basis of the economic environment has been constrained by the changes in the economic base that have occurred as a result of globalization.
According to Zhang Li, the global economic adjustment was largely over by the end of 2017 and would enter a new growth cycle after 2018, the next one must have been driven by raw products.
7FRESH, the first student supermarket in Kyoto, has recently opened and plans to open more than 1,000 shops across the country in the next 3 to 5 years.
Add Ali's box of horse and horse, the immortal super-species, the Sunin's Succubus, the Pisper of the Spectrum, and so on, the New Retail Shop began to collide, and they called each other boards on innovative models and even prices.
The escalation of the competition for fresh supermarkets has become a phenomenon in the new retail sector, where is the new retailing?
"In 2018, we'll be able to enter the country quickly, before the Spring Festival in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou will open a lot of shops. "
"The New Strike" of 2018 was revealed at the Second New Retail Summit.
"Since 2018, the box is not just a fresh powerer, but a living-class electrician who serves consumers instantaneously.
Under the core mode line is lead, experience, online is real sales... "
Different from the traditional malls, the supermarkets, the box of horses born in the eyes of many consumers as a fun and delicious Internet red store, and even an intermediary has invented the concept of a box house.
On-line electrician platforms and off-line retailers have advantages and disadvantages, and consumers appear on multiple channels, so both parties are trying a full-channel model.
The industry believes that, in the context of the escalation of consumption, there will be more and more box horses in 2018.
And the boxing horse continues to explore more areas of consumption from its early life, predicting more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
"For example, the business model of online and underground integration attracts the eyes of consumers, and the fresh supermarkets everywhere are called good. "
"It's useless to talk about these relationships, to show off, and finally to see if you've brought a good experience to the consumer, and I'm willing to pay for them. "
In the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and demand has changed.
Turns out it's broken on the line, it's broken on the line, it's beaten on the line, it's under the counterattack line, it's holding hands together now, because the consumer has no line-to-line distinction.
The competition for capital makes the new retail gunpowder, which is now represented by a fresh supermarket.
Analysis suggests that the current competition for new retail sales in front-line cities is far from reaching the Red Sea pattern, with large areas of second-line cities still to be explored and markets still have great opportunities and space.
The layout of new retailing in different types of industries will bring the development of new retailing into a diversified state.
The China Institute for Economics and Economics Studies of the Chinese Institute of Social Sciences and Economics organized a dry product, the Chinese electrician's annual development report.
What kind of report card did the Chinese electrician produce this year?
What are the trends in global electricity suppliers?
Let's find out for everyone.
The sales volume goes back to acceleration.
It's so cool that we've been growing at a very high rate since 2006, when we thought Internet purchases were so fresh that we could buy things without going out!
However, starting in 2013, the growth rate of online retail sales began to fall to less than 50 per cent, and in 2015 for the first time, the rate of growth was below 40 per cent, turning into 26.2 per cent in 2016.
But it's not the same this year, and online retailing has picked up again, rising to 34.2% in January-September this year.
Much higher than 2015 and 2016 growth rate.
Maybe we'll go around and find it more pleasurable to buy or buy.
Of this, the value of online retailing of goods is nearly $5.08 trillion, and the value of online retailing of services is nearly $1.49 trillion.
The share of total retail sales of social goods amounted to 13.6 per cent, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points over the same period.
Class, don't fall asleep. Focus. Service sales are a big success.

To help you avoid becoming the next start-up company.
Amy Erett tried to investigate the well-being of her employees at her e-commerce start-up company, but the investigation didn't work.
The responses are often vague, unhelpful, and even worse, deceptive.
Even though she promised to use anonymity, some employees still didn't trust the process.
Erett was in charge of 75 man-made San Francisco e-commerce company Madison Reed, who stated that "the responses received lacked consistency and objectivity".
So she called for help.
A new group of human resource start-ups have emerged as springs of the rain, helping companies to understand how they feel about their employees.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure staff participation, which allows companies to conduct rapid polls for specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to bypass over-regulation and report directly to the board of directors.
"Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where's the company Fitbit?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood Entrepreneurship, said that Glint software analysis tools are used by companies to measure employee professionalism.
Erett said that in three years, she had gained more insight into the ideas and feelings of her staff with Glint.
In addition to the rapid investigation and opinion polls by specific teams, Glint also provides hot maps of the company, which offices have the highest number of complaints and which managers have approved low scores — which allows her to understand the reasons in depth.
Companies are beginning to realize that they have to be skilled in controlling their workplace culture to avoid becoming the next step. A blog post on harassment was published by ex-employees, who were punished by the company, and then got caught up in a scandal.
For a start-up company like Glint, the company's desire for oversight is a moneyless business opportunity.
According to data from the Financial Technology Analysis website Let's Talk Payments, by 2020 the value of the regulatory and compliance industry in global governance could exceed $118.7 billion.
Convercent, a start-up company in Denver, Colorado, dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect misconduct, saw an increase in interest and activity during the loss of their reputation earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Abby, Microsoft and Tesla.
You've recently signed up to be a client.
Like Glint, Convert allows companies to send customized "diagnostic" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and look at hot maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous text hotlines for employees to report misconduct.
If the chairman is implicated, then the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Confercent, said: "The Court of Public Opinion has usurped the powers of the regulator.
If a company is found to be bad at its employees or to be unethical at its employees, it may face consumer resistance, loss of staff and the high consequences of being involved in litigation, as Quinlan says.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain with more than 500 places and more than 25,000 employees, has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of work guidelines and protocols and provide easy access to company headquarters.
Until then, if the employee wishes to report the problem, he must find the company's headquarters telephone number or e-mail, make a formal complaint and hope that the headquarters will take it seriously.
It's often a scary and disturbing experience, as Ruby Tuesday's legal adviser, James Vitrano, says, he doesn't think there's a good way to track employees' complaints.
But now that the company uses Convercent, it will be able to identify and resolve more quickly problems previously unknown to executives in remote offices, cities or states, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
"I can be closer, 360 degrees full of work experience," says Vitrano, who is responsible for Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment lawsuits. "
According to Quinlan, after the closure of the Andorran accounting firm because of the Enron scandal, companies began to place greater emphasis on ethics, values and staff professionalism in 2002.
But it wasn't until after "social media went into their own world" that companies realized that they couldn't stop their explosion from spreading online.
"Before technology is used to monitor morality, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent used their software as a service and charged companies recurring costs for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors, who have already supported these two start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and its total capital rose to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total of $60 million.
Given the interlinkage between companies, culture and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing body of research shows that today employees expect more in the workplace than before.
In a highly competitive market like Silicon Valley, high-paying and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted, valued, that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voices are being heard, and what they do is useful, they are more committed to making the company succeed." LinkedIn Global Welfare and Staff Experience Vice President Nina McCartney said LinkedIn uses two softwares, Convert and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when employees are loyal and professional.
If the third-party analysis tool promises to increase staff loyalty and professionalism, it's not surprising that they are looking for financial support.
Workplace culture specialists say that it is important to have data on the professionalism of employees.
However, these data are useless unless the management of the company takes action.
In fact, if a company requires feedback from employees, it can be expected that the company is undergoing change.
If change does not move fast enough, or if little progress is made, it may lead to disappointment and lead to staff leaving the company.
"If you're looking for 4000 proposals, then you need to be ready for 4000 conversations." "He's seen some companies rely too much on data-collection mistakes.
'Cause if you don't follow through, the staff will think, 'Do you really hear what I'm saying?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I?"
Erett said Madison Reed was now conducting a monthly staff survey and was able to take action on the same day Glint reported the problem.
Having collected feedback from employees about their frustration with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing the intra-corporate team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is getting new insights into its employees, and in the long run they want to be able to change in this industry, which is known for its high rate of brain drain, to better retain their staff.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you'll lose talent," Vitrano said.
"If you lose talent, you lose clients.
And when you lose your client, you lose the company. "

NCAA cancels training twice a day, prolongs the daytime training of the Bears.
At 11 p.m., UCLA football team members hang around the new campus practice field.
Some players have taken off their jerseys and showed up on the first day of camp trying to train their sweaty bodies.
For a large part of the team, this spare few minutes is a break.
After three hours of practice, the players in the summer course will return to the dormitory for final exams, and then back to the Wasserman football center at 6.30 a.m. the next morning.
"The next three days will be a bump to these guys," said Jim Mora, the bear coach, on Monday he's about to enter Tuesday.
NCAA cancelled the practice twice a day, but actually extended their daytime training -- at least by the end of Friday.
That's why the first three trainings at UCLA are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the schedule where the players have been squeezed.
From the cancellation of two trainings a day to more training a day, the Bears trained almost a week before the last season, and Mora trained for the first time at summer school in the six seasons of Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions on August 20th, and then start preparing for the official tournament for the first Texas farm worker in September.
Mora said he supported the NCA's rule adjustment, although it would make the players busy and add another project.
"In three or four days, we'll give them a huge amount of training, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"They've just passed. They're grinding, they're all great kids.
I think by Saturday we'll have more time, really good. "
As soon as the camp is over, UCLA will stop training. Given the proximity of parking and the clear sight of Luskin Center, this is not an easy task.
From this weekend onwards, the Bears will be staying at the hotel, but Mora admits that once these rooms are empty in the season, problems may arise.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a real concern... that someone might rent a room and sit in it to record a training scene, and that's not far-fetched.
If you've got a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures in parking lot 8.
We'll use the available resources to do the best we can.
I wouldn't worry too much about that.
We have a plan. "

Facebook will introduce a fact-checking function to counter false news.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that it would send more potential pranks to third-party testing agencies and present the results below the original page. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to crack down on so-called false news.
In its statement on the website, Facebook stated that Facebook would start using an updated machine to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to the fact-checker, possibly showing the results of the fact-checking under the original address.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main outlets of the so-called false news, and many believe Facebook has influenced the 2016 presidential election in the United States.
This issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, where voters experienced a proliferation of false stories before the May presidential elections in France, and Germany, which first approved a fine plan before the September elections, will be fined if social media networks fail to remove hate messages in time.
Facebook in a separate German statement on Thursday stated that a new fact-check function test was being initiated in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
In a blog, Sarah Sue, the producer of Facebook news, said, "In addition to seeing what stories are being questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more background to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "relevant articles" function and make other changes to its news profile to reduce false news.

"What kind of a person is this to leave this letter in my hands. "
Throughout the Middle Ages until the Eduards, the book "A Castle of England" recorded the families living in Skotney, and each story was made by different artists like Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Roz's first book with an archive as a raw material: he also wrote "The Dead's Teeth and Other Tales in 2014", a book inspired by the literature of the British Library, a work he did with an uncontrollable passion for creation.
He said, "I saw the thumbprint left on the side of the letter, which was written by a dual agent who worked for Jacobs in the 18th century. "
"That's his fingerprints!
And the letters always smelled smoke, because then you needed a light to light up.
For us in 300 years, the smell makes people feel like they're around us.
Oh, I love archives!"
For those who are moved by old paper, it seems great to have the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and lived in the castle for almost four months.
Roz spent days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, looking through archives, studying many of the estate's treasures and old games, such as hyena heads hanging on walls and bottles that spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered on the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with vagrants, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who drew illustrations for his book.
And then at night, he's like, "Drink up and write."
The secret history of Skotney is not yet clear, because the National Trust only entered fully after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hersey, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff started processing the files, and he described them as "The nobles are leaving hundreds of years ago: "Oh, put them in the attic."
The diary, a letter from the British Empire, paints a map of the borders of nations: "You'll think land disputes will be boring," Roz says, "But two families will fight for a white herb tree.
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in this work start with the castle, and then look at the history of Britain at a broader level, including the "Worker," and the story is based on a man who left the new castle to participate in the peasant uprising of 1381.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex" in the book recorded a riot in the castle in 1380, said Roz.
"The peasant uprising began in that area, and I think it's a good place to start it.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as the Reverend, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the period of religious reform in England.
Or The Smuggler, the story is owned by Arthur Darrell, the 18th century smuggler, who was thought to have his funeral by filling his coffin with stones.
The Darrells are the Roz's favorite house of the Skotney Castle: "These gentlemen seem to be scoundrels, always borrowing money and buying things they can't afford.
A generation after a generation of Darrell men who are able to settle their debt by marrying wealthy old women, I think they should be a group of handsome young men who know how to pursue women ... "
As his mission in the castle ended, Rhodes began to look for other strange writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the wasteland of Finland doing a drawing novel about "El?m?nm?ki", an early 20th century sanatorium that was slowly abandoned.
But Scottie has a special place for him.
"I left sad," he said.
"It's like, "Oh, I've got to face the real life of the cranberry."
According to the news reporter, the Chinese smart car team is based in Joo Hae, and the man who runs it is Chinese executive vice president Tanaka.
All the big energy companies are "rich and hostile." So who's the best of the world's many energy companies?
Yesterday, the famous PFC Energy Company announced the top 50 of the 2011 list of listed energy companies, and the United States oil and gas producer ExxonMobil won a US$ 40,633 million win, followed by Chinese oil and the Dutch Royal Shell.
In this PFC list, Chinese oil was twice in 2007 and 2009, with ExxonMobil taking the top of the list in other years.
In 2011, three of the top 50 companies from mainland China came in, with China's petrochemicals in the ninth place and China's marine oil in the fifteenth place, in addition to China's second-ranked oil.
According to the PFC, however, although the current oil prices are much higher than they were four years ago, the CEO of the PFC Energy Corporation points out that there are many reasons for the low overall market value, mainly the decline in natural gas prices in North America and the low dynamism of the global stock market.

United States changes to green card regulations
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that the United States would introduce a new immigration plan and amend the Green Card regulations.
The scheme is intended to reduce legal migration to 50,000 persons per year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications will be subject to stricter regulations.
The new regulations were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both houses.
The American media quoted Trump as saying, "This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and realize these benefits by changing the way the United States distributes green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will replace the current programme and reduce chain migration ...
This new application process facilitates English speaking, financial support and skills for economic development ... "
On May 29th, the first China Fireworks Safe Environment Fair will be held in Sakaoyang.
The event was organized around the theme "Technology, safety, environmental protection" for a period of two days, at which time the state-of-the-art pyrotechnic machinery in the fireworks and fireworks industry, the most safe and environmentally safe granular materials and new products, will be gathered in the sun.
The fair will involve a large number of experts, entrepreneurs, academic exchanges in the fireworks industry, sharing the latest technological results of the firecrackers on safe environmental protection.
Among them, the demonstration of the Mechanized Pyrotechnic Production Equipment and the Safe Environmental Products will take place in Tai Chi Town, with the participation of technically mature, technically certified and safe fireworks producing drug-related mechanical equipment, low sensitivity, low explosive power safety pyrotechnics, sulphur-free, micro-smoke, and other safe, environmentally friendly personal combustion products.

In order to optimize the landscape and build beautiful South China, recently, the South China Tobacco Office (sub-company) '636' volunteer corps carried out an environmental campaign called "Standing the Forest, Home-Friendly".
The event was supported not only by all the staff of the regional tobacco department, but also by retired seniors, whose families were involved in environmental practices, but also by three generations of young and old, who were working together to watch the mountains, clean up the garbage and give their share of the effort to build the beautiful South China.
The purpose of this volunteer service is to protect the resources of the Southern Landscape, to promote the concept of volunteerism, which is "to love others, to love society, to love nature", and to enable the next generation to embrace the virtues of volunteerism from an early age.
According to the information received, since its inception in early April this year, the "636" Volunteering Brigade has 16 development members, who have been engaged in a series of volunteer activities, such as visiting handicapped retail clients, helping smokers to care for tobacco leaves, and the Aryan earthquake love donation, to become a volunteer force to deliver positive energy with heart.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful.
Just when you thought 2017 wouldn't be weirder, the sex robots released a new technology development report.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report that looks forward to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Shaggy, retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence and co-founder of FRR at Sheffield University, we need to start taking the emergence of sex robots seriously.
The customer can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the nipple shape and the nail type.
Shaggy, in his new report, said, "People laugh behind their backs, but big companies do put out a lot of sex robots, and we'll see more."
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots, with silicone skin, touching warm skins, and deliberately using artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual responses.
Users can also "self-defined" their robots to satisfy their preferences, ranging from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But what's even more disturbing is that a lot of robots with "personality" make "replicate wife" look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
RealBotix, for example, allows robots to come from definitions based on characteristics that users find attractive, such as shyness.
And Roxxxy Gold, developed by True Companion, has predefined character features, including a slightly shy "cold Fara" and a "presumptuous wild Wendy".
"Roxxy Gold robots have as much personality as you can, and True Companion's website is very happy about it.
That's why she loves what you love and hates what you do.
She's just like normal people. She's got a little mood in those days!
She can be lazy, talkative, or "sexually dynamic"!
The rise of sex robots has created a great deal of anxiety — not only to replace real human relationships — but also the femininity of bowing and the implication of rape on the cold (read: resistance) of Farah is most worrying.
True Companion compares Roxxy to a man's vibrating stick on his website.
The website says, "If a woman has a vibrator, then why can't a man have Roxxy?"
But these sex robots are not just a lover, they're not just a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing maturity point directly to the darker, deeper part of our culture: from perfect gender equality to sex with subjugation as an option.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming popular, they are still on the brink of consumer culture.
But something that penetrates from the edge allows us to see the process of our time.
A lot of people aren't weird or aggressive until the free market gives them a chance to be like this.
It's no coincidence that these fine sex robots emerged in an era when the rights of women around the globe were threatened and that there was a White House president who boasted about sexual violence against women.
The most gruesome part of the TV show "Story of the Embroidery" isn't the reality, it's not the hanging corpse, it's not the eyes that were dug out, it's the imagination that's too real.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but it doesn't look so far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create, as technically as possible, the most female-like body in the world.
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and imitate real human action.
But to put it bluntly, their personality doesn't represent the real woman.
They can't break up, they can't run away.
They have no recourse, no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking the illusion of total slavery.
In other words, they're fun slaves.
Or according to the common saying of 2017: handmaiden.

Deng Chau said, "In the show, I won't do the same thing, I'll keep updating. "
The great work of Trump?
Let Mitt Romney become a microcosm of common sense.
Political differences have led to polarization among American voters, and micro-levels have undermined American family harmony. This is no surprise to the Trump era.
Before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States were filled with commentary columns about how to deal with the fear of voting for Trump relatives.
It's usually thought that we're doing everything we can to break our "filtration foam".
Less to say is Trump's power to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, has long been at odds with our Republicans, and he's coming to New York to visit me this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can make a powerful difference.
As a result of working with Trump in the White House, all the people she knew, even the relatives of Republicans who had been having political quarrels for decades, were now suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It's certainly a good thing if we're all at the table, but I'm shocked that, from a broader perspective, it's a great risk.
While the leftist has been encouraged by Trump, the warp effect of his presidency has driven us all to the right.
When we're talking about Normalization and Trump, we're talking about the possibility that his eccentricity might stop one day.
There is, however, a more worrying and long-term scenario in which Trump wants to "normalize" relations with right-wing Republicans, who were opposed to Mr. President's criteria before, and now suddenly appear to be a symbol of reason.
I've recently found myself a little bit reminiscent of Mitt Romney's eccentricity: putting dogs on cars, 14 percent of his income tax (but at least we know his tax returns) seems to be too minor a crime in comparison to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate needs to rationally qualify for immeasurable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the New York Park Rotation Horse, the biggest carousel run by the New York Central Park Administration. If you don't need coffee, these three-dollar tickets are your most consumer in the city.
The sound of the horse is thunderous, the cylindrical cylindrical is designed for glass fibers, all the clowns and animals twist their heads, the horrors and evils look at their shoulders, and the music of the tinkering sounds strangely.
Too many mediocre cities are disappointing: from the landscape overlooking the buildings, the skyline becomes too familiar to provide too much stimulus, and the reality of cities does not sustain dreams.
Thirty-five years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, and I find that this Swiss cabin is not really a Swiss cabin, but an old Swiss cabin in the theme bar, and I can't remember it, but it's near a junction in northern London.
However, the merry-go-round in Central Park is still a magical experience, and everyone has fun for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four 40-year-old girls.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I'd give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, I was asked to give a one-to-five-star rating on my trading experience before I took a credit card.
The same thing happened in my coffee shop in the corner of the street, and you could use a 15% tip to rate it for shopping on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what is supposed to be a neutral transaction, but also to put pressure on the waiter to add personal factors to an unwanted scenario.
The poor woman at the department store smiled with regret, and I was exhausted, and the credit card deal gave her a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistolis was transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain.
This is the second time Pistolis has been transferred from prison to hospital.
Last year he was taken to the hospital to treat a wrist cut, which the prison official claimed was the result of a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the prosecutor appealed the original miskill decision.
In the early morning hours of Valentine ' s Day in 2013, he was shot several times in his home in Pretoria through the toilet door in Stinkamp, until he died.
Pistolis claims to mistook his girlfriend for a break-in at night.
The prosecutor has declared their intention to appeal again, this time for six years in prison against Pistolis, which they consider too generous.
The National Public Prosecutor's Office has indicated that an appeal will be filed with the Supreme Court of South Africa and that this appeal can be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistolis will face a 15-year sentence.
South Africa has no death penalty.

Two Bulgarians detained for illegal camping in Greece
bTV quoted information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were detained by the police in Cissonia.

On May 18th, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Mechanism for the management of the special prize fund for the restructuring of industrial enterprises" and will arrange for special prize funds to help defuse the coal industry's excess capacity in the steel industry, amounting to $100 billion.
Many local governments such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang have recently proposed reforms to address excess capacity.
A number of these provinces have even proposed to actively seek financial support from the central financial authorities for the de-productivity of their provinces.
One of the proofs is that the declared coal removal target in only eight provinces stands at 90 per cent of the national coal reduction plan.
In an interview with a journalist, Lim Boqiang, Director of the Chinese Energy Policy Research Institute at Xiamen University, argued that the "de-productivity" in the steel and coal industries was far from enough to rely on 100 billion yuan from the centre, and that more funding was needed from local governments and businesses.
In its recently published regulations on the implementation of coal decapitation in Shanxi province, the Shanxi Coal Group was transformed into a State-owned capital investment company to reorganize the assets and operations of the enterprise and create a new business model.
The actual funding gap may have been three times greater than the subsidy, when the Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, Yoo-min, stated that the initial count of "de-capable" employees' coal systems was 1.3 million, and the steel system 500,000.
The Southern Daily News (journalist/Sheikingung) reporter today was informed by the Department of Environmental Protection that the results of the 2012 Environmental Protection Credit Ratings for priority pollution sources in Guangdong province are being publicized.

There are more heavy-contaminated companies, mainly in electroplating, dye printing, and anti-pollution, and some sewage treatment plants are well known.
According to the provincial EPA, the ratings are now posted on the EPA website to reflect the principles of openness, fairness and fairness and subject to public scrutiny.
During the publicity, EPA receives calls from the public, letters, visits, etc., and will investigate, verify and deal with the issues reflected.

Does meat, dairy products and chocolate help to alleviate inflammatory enteropathy (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: diets rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of inflammation in people with intestinal diseases.
This incurable disease has had an impact on the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British, causing stomach convulsions and abdominal swelling, recurrent or haemorrhagic diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington usually advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to mitigate symptoms, but researchers find that key amino acid-coloural acids in proteins help to promote immunocellular cell growth, which enhances intestine resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, the lead researcher, explained that immunocellular cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not enter the body quietly.
Balance between cells that cause inflammation and those that increase tolerance, protecting the body from all kinds of sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
Inflammation can occur when the equilibrium is too biased.
An immunosuppressive cell was found in the lab in rats carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need colour amino acid to form the form of cells.
Professor Kronner said, "We've established a link between a bacterial species and a species of resistant cells.
The more chlamydia the mice eat in their diet, the more immunosuppressive cells they get.
He suggested that if humans were to use the same method, i.e. the combination of rubella and chroma-rich diets could create a more resistant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barragangwas, a postdoctoral researcher, studied an immunocellular cell that enhanced resistance, when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but not when the same strain was raised separately.
She suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbes of mice.
DNA sequenced cholesterol in mice found six bacterial species in mice with immunocellular cells, but not in mice without immunocellular cells.
The mice are raised in an sterile environment, so they lack intestinal microbes and cannot be immunosuppressed cells, and the presence of rubella macium gives rise to immunosuppressive cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivate Lucifer Bacillus in liquids and then transfer a small amount of bacterial liquids to premature immune cells separated from mice.
The immunosuppressive cell develops into a resistant cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be shown to be a by-product of the metabolism of chromamate, known as thallium-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of chlamydia in rat feed, the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of chromium acid was halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have the same resistance cells as rats, and that most of us have Lucifer Bacillus in our gastrointestinal tract.
Is it possible for humans to induce cell development by-products of chroma acid from rubella in humans, like the lab rats, which is not known at present, but which have genetic defects associated with chlamydia in people with inflammatory intestinal diseases?
She said, "The growth of these cells may be the result of what we want, because they control the inflammation of the inside of the intestinal surface.
Unprecisely, the presence of high-level coloured amino acid in the Lucifer Bacillus may lead to an increase in the number of species.
José Mulligno thinks Mann has signed "The Genius" Nemania Matitch.
On Wednesday night, after the first appearance of Nemania Matitch in the Sampdolia competition, Mullignio concluded that Mannion had signed a "genius" midfield player.
Matich, from Chelsea, signed up to 40 million pounds, playing 2-1 on Tuesday in the final pre-season match in Dublin before the European Super Bowl in the Royal Madrid, winning the favor of Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, in the pre-Brusty Asian Tour, the Matiche race was seriously inadequate, only 45 minutes to complete, and Mulligno acknowledged the need to improve it before the British Superseason begins.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and genius thinking -- he thinks football," said Murigno.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible."
Mullignio started arranging his first act at the beginning of the season. Like Martinic, the new contract players Victor Linderov and Romelu Lucacu started the game at the Injeval Stadium.
This week, the Independent reported that Mulligno still wants to introduce three more contract players, but he insists that the club works well, that he has four top contract players in his heart, and that the club has already introduced three of them.
"The club brought in three of them, and I'm very grateful. "He added...
"I'd be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they've done a great deal for me. "
If China hadn't built this type of warship, would it have fallen behind?
With the recent announcement by the world’s major naval powers of plans for the construction of new frigates, it seems as if the frigates have been the focus of the naval forces of the great Powers overnight, starting with Japan’s decision to purchase two new frigates in the 2018 defence budget, which has finally led to a substantial breakthrough in the Japanese frigate programme, and ending with the recent announcement by Lockheed Martin of the latest plans for the United States frigate program, the FFG.
With the release of a new type 054A frigate in late 2017, marking the construction of as many as 29 frigates as 054A, it has approached the sum of the 053H series of frigates, and the construction of 054A has been in progress for 12 years since the first 054A was brought down in 2006, with such a large number of high-performance general frigates, even on a worldwide scale, except in China, and only the United States of America in the 1970s and 1980s.
And the reason why we're building so many 054As is simple, it's good, it's good, plus the Navy's debts for years.
The 054A frigate has been favoured by the Chinese Navy for many years on the basis of high value value and good combat power, with about 4,000 tons of drainage, with a delivery system with a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of red flags-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missiles, 8 eagles hitting 83 and a direct-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and designed earlier, but its combat capacity, even if placed today, would have reached medium-level levels among the world's frigates.
But after all, this is the first type of ship designed at the beginning of the twenty-first century, equipped with weapons, whose power systems and electronic radar equipment are already very different from the world's most dominant frigates, like the European frigate, which is fully powered, the small multifunctional phase-control radar, and the large size of the helicopter deck, and the time has come to develop a new type.
So how should China's new frigate develop? It has a direct bearing on its future positioning and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future of China's navy will become a blue-water navy, and the future will be a seaward one, with rapid deployment in areas where China's interests are at stake, a demonstration of the presence of force and, if necessary, a strong force to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not undermined.
Then look at the positioning of the new frigates in the future Chinese navy sequence, the future Chinese Navy will be similar to the United States Navy, and other main ships will form carrier battle groups or amphibious strike fleets, as required, in addition to the required offshore defence vessels.
The role of the new frigate, which should be the main anti-submarine force in the future carrier battle group and the emptiness of the medium-to-near area, and the size of the amphibious attack ship strike group, requires that the new frigate have a strong anti-submarine capability and a good medium-range emptiness capability.
Based on these positions, it is bold to imagine the shape of a future national frigate.
First of all, there will be a significant increase in drainage compared to the current frigate type 054A, with an estimated discharge of about 5000-6000 tons for new frigates; the power system will use an integrated power propulsion system consisting of a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed of about 30 knots and a significant increase in flight power; the armoury and stationary platform will be expanded to reach two 10-tonne-class helicopters, with a red flag 10 launch system, but with a 32-48 red flag 16 and fish-8 plume system, which should be based on the development of a 346-A small four-sided fixed-colour system, with multiple revolving radars similar to those on the European frigate.
So the overall level of the new frigate will be at the world's best, even as compared to the United States FPG.
Of course, the concept is just an assumption by the author of the new frigate of national origin that we can only look into it when the new frigate is in the water. Let's expect it together.

Chinese households have a debt rate close to that of the United States. What's more terrible than being unable to afford a home?
In recent times, there has been discussion about recent changes in real estate policy, and whether it will be untying again. Will the diversification of the land supply mix cause housing prices to fall?
But when we were worried about real estate prices, about macroeconomic regulation, about future developments in the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again, the last time we talked about how People's Daily commented on real estate regulation, and now the Daily People's Journal wrote about a much more serious issue than the lack of affordable housing, even if you could afford it and pay for it.
Today, let's talk about something more serious than buying a house: paying off.
First, China’s Growing Housing Debt Crisis
In November 2017, according to the data of the People's Daily Overseas edition, which published a review article on January 17, the Award and Loans... Fighting Youth's Happiness and Concerns, the Third Quarterly Report on China's Leveraging Process, issued by the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the National Centre for Balance Sheet Research, stated that the population's sector leverage rate continued to increase, rising from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter, rising by 1.3 percentage points and rising by 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The resident sector ' s share of debt in the whole real economy has increased, and the leverage rate has increased faster.
Studies have shown that Chinese households ' liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, which account for about two thirds of residents ' liabilities, about two times the level of operating loans.
Of these, about 80 per cent were medium- and long-term loans, mainly for housing, but, on an incremental basis, short-term consumer loans grew faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition to this, China's household debt rate is only a measure of the total amount of credit that the family sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households also have a large number of private loans, including from relatives and friends, and there are large-scale hidden debts.
Seeing this data, there is some obfuscation. According to the Suning Institute of Financial Research, China ' s leverage rate was only 3 per cent in 1996 and only 18 per cent in 2008, but since 2008 it has begun to grow rapidly, doubling to 36.4 per cent in just six years. By the third quarter of 2017, it had reached 48.6 per cent.
In May last year, HSBC issued a survey across nine countries, with visitors approaching tens of thousands of people.
The report is addressed to the "mega-generation" of young people in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report states that 80,90 years after the birth of China, 70 per cent of young people live in housing, and that the second-largest Mexican (46 per cent) is twice as high as the United States indicator (35 per cent).
These data tell us that there's a very likely problem that the largest potential "grey rhinoceros" in China at this stage may not be able to pay the debt, as compared to the unaffordable housing.
Second, why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analysed, although we have been saying that housing prices are high in China, the country's housing ownership rate is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world, so rather than being too expensive to afford a house, I am afraid that the question for many friends is now whether you can afford a loan?
As we look at the world's real estate markets, China's real estate markets, due to their late start, have not experienced a major real estate crisis, except in Hainan, as we said earlier, but the origin of the world's financial tsunami in 2008 was the real estate crisis in the United States just a decade ago.
The reason for the real estate crisis in the United States was attributed to two houses: Remy and Emeritus.
In the golden age of the United States, when real estate companies sold their homes to low-income people at that time in order to expand their sales, and when the United States economy was improving, the real estate market was booming, but not long enough, with growth stagnating in the United States, causing home buyers' incomes to fall, and then a large amount of household consumption spending began to fall.
However, the current situation in the United States was a component of the financial and real estate assets of United States household assets, with almost all household assets of low-income groups in the United States being real estate, while most of the assets of the top 20 per cent of the high-income groups were financial assets, resulting in higher debt ratios for the poorer households in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people buy houses when the economy is better, so the money paid for the mortgage is also calculated in terms of their better income, and when the income falls, the pressure on the mortgage not only does not diminish, but even increases because of subprime schemes, so that the real estate problems of these American families have gradually become a real estate crisis.
As a result, the banks began to repossess the property because they were too low to pay for it, and when the banks recovered the property from the buyer who had defaulted on the loan, they sold it at very low prices, which led to a gradual decline in the region's housing prices, a process that led to a further decline in the price of the house, creating a vicious circle in which, when the house price fell to a certain extent, more and more buyers discovered that their house was worth even less than their own loans, so that more people stopped paying back their mortgages and caused more bad debts.
As a result, a huge vicious circle has emerged:
"The economic downturn — the decline in income — some people can't afford a mortgage — the low bank prices for the sale of the debtor's house — the fall in the house price — more people stop paying back the mortgage — the bank sells it — the fall in the price of the house ..."
And that's not the problem, because the price of the house is falling, and it's not that you have no debt after people stop paying the house to the bank, and if the bank's auction money is not on the bank's loan, then you still need to pay back, simply assuming you paid $600,000 in initial, $2.4 million in loans, bought a house worth $3 million at the time, and when the house was worth only $2 million, you stopped paying the house to the bank, the bank auctioned the house, you not only lost your first payment of $600,000, you paid $400,000 in debt to the bank, but you still have to pay back the money.
So, in a vicious cycle, the American economy gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the 2008 financial crisis in the United States.
It is therefore a matter of great caution that the current level of 46.8 per cent of China ' s household debt rate is high, which is still below the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly emphasized the issue of deleveraging since last year, a very early judgement that if the household debt rate is allowed to continue rising, it will entail enormous risks, so that financial risks will be carefully prevented.
And then the house was used to live, not for job placement, and the State accelerated the establishment of multi-subject supplies, multi-channel security, lease-purchase measures, etc., to further address potential risks.
For our own families, it is important to abandon speculative thinking about real estate and buy a house as much as possible, so that their families do not fall into a huge burden. Only a reasonable assessment of their income and level of indebtedness is a healthy path to family wealth development.

Chairman Wanda, Wang Kenlin, worked hard to save the game, working on and off the line, even attending two China Cup launches himself, and turned into a hot shaving chip.
Today, a lot of Internet buyers have discovered the word "mog effect" in their express logistics.
One of the reasons for the delay in the delivery was the lack of traffic control and capacity, which was affected by the fog weather.
The English inventor implants a chip in his own body and waves his hand into the house and into the car.
A British inventor who installs a chip for himself can just wave his hand to open his front door, enter the office and even start the car, becoming the first person in the country.
33-year-old Steven Northham planted a small chip between his thumb and index finger and is now offering this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, which is done by his company, BioTeq, through technology.
He's been working with Jeff Watson, Senior Anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to cat and dog chip implants and only takes 30 seconds.
Mr. Northham's company will also replace the locks of the rooms and vehicles to match the chip, at a cost of £300 per lock.
This married father with a child has now installed the technology for his family and his BMW Z4, and he can start the car with his hands on the wheel.
Speaking of the Central Financial Work Conference, which has a great deal of sense, it focuses on both national development and personal life.
On 10 July, the National Statistical Office issued the National Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Industrial Producer Price Index (PPI) for the month of June 2016.
White House props cost thousands of dollars.
According to military records published in Time magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing, at a cost of $24,000.
Sikorsky VH-3D in Green and White was an important exhibit in the White House on July 17, highlighting American construction projects.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Burns and senior White House officials have visited all 50 states of manufacturing.
The exhibit included helicopters made in Connecticut, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the first fleet of the Marines helicopter (HMX-1) in charge of operating the helicopter, the White House military office requested the helicopter to appear on a daily order (FRAGO) for only 36 hours before landing on the South Lawn for this "special" operation.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1, in an e-mail sent to his superior deputy commander of the Marine Corps flight, said, "I just want to confirm that you know that this is a highly regarded event. "
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive on the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17th for the event at 3 p.m. and will leave until 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on the same day.
The information also indicates that in case the departure from the White House is delayed, the return flight will require a second crew due to time constraints on duty.
The original crew was standing by the helicopter during the operation, while the security forces were standing by while the aircraft was on the ground.
The records of Time magazine do not clearly indicate the final need for a second crew.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record indicates that HMX-1 asked if the event was in violation of the Act.
The commander wrote, "The question we ask is whether this is a violation of the Hatch Act and is told that it is not. "
"Sounds like you're locked in," the deputy commander replied.
The White House defined this "American manufacturing" activity as an official activity and was therefore not subject to the Hutch Act.
But even official activities are political.
At the event, the President promoted the issue of the Senate at the time: medical reform and the regulation of government regulations.
The use of Marine 1 or Air Force 1 aircraft for political propaganda purposes is no longer new.
Successive presidents have been asked to travel by these aircraft.
But it's not very common to expropriate them for photo purposes only.
In February, Trump received attention when the president's special jet slipped in Melbourne, Florida, and ended up in the background of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the former president's use of the presidential jet.
The White House's deputy news spokesman, Lindsay Walters, said, "The White House is so excited about this "American Made" exhibition, which shows products from all 50 states, manufactured by American workers using American materials. "
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn to practice the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
Early in July, during the G-20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings in the White House.
According to one official, this U.S. manufacturing flight is included in this month's crew training request.
The helicopter unit also flew 11 extra hours of the non-presidential support mission that day.
The White House claims that the taxpayer did not bear the cost of any other props in the event.
Sikorsky spokesmen say the company was not involved in arranging a south lawn helicopter show.
HMX-1 does not maintain a budget record for the President's flight, and it is therefore very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Department of Defense's hourly cost records for the 2017 financial year, VH-3D's Ministry of Defence is entitled to reimbursement in the amount of US$ 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records 30 minutes each flight from the base of the Marine Corps at Quantico Airport, Virginia.
The White House says the cost of operating the helicopter is much lower than that.
Walters says it's very misleading to estimate the taxpayers' expenses on a reimbursable basis.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs included in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Ministry of Defence's reimbursable costs do not include personnel costs, but do include fuel, maintenance and contracting costs.
On that occasion, Sean Spike, former White House news spokesman, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
The idea is to show what the United States is making this week.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, that they're all contributing to our national security, and I guess hundreds of people, if not thousands, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the product of countless American efforts.
So, of course, it's not out of place to show it. "
We don't know if Trump interacts with the helicopter during the tour of the South Lawn, but he's in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to a representative of Sikorsky and made fun of his own company plane with the media.
He said, "I know about Sikorsky.

According to the information received, Chongqing City currently has 18 shale gas prospecting rights established by the Ministry of Land and Resources and the first shale gas mining rights in the country — China's petrochemical mausoleum gas fields.
By January 2017, 368 shale gas wells (excluding parametric wells) had been drilled in Chongqing and 261 had been produced. In the recent past, with good news that four shale gas test days were exceeding 200,000 cubic metres in the southern region of Pinghashi, in China, the first commercially mined shale gas field outside of North America, China, is expected to be able to produce 10 billion cubic metres this year, as planned.
It is known that 10 billion cubic metres of shale gas fields are equivalent to a 10 million-ton-class large oil field.
It is understood that shale gas, as a clean energy source, can reduce CO2 by 12 million tons per year when 10 billion shale gas fields are built.

It's a pleasure for the family of the senior aunts who live in a dormitory of the Democratic Roads Mechanical Hall in Nanning.
The neighbors also say that it's rare to see a flower tree, and the residents of the neighborhood think it's a blessing, and they'll be happy to come and see it.
"Malabash" is a tropical plant of Mexican origin, warm and humid, which can only be flowered if the conditions of sunlight, moisture, nutrients, etc. are suitable.
Even in the wild, where tropical conditions are appropriate, flowers are rare, and once there was the term "one in a thousand."
Yesterday morning, the reporter came to Nanning City's Hall of Democratic Machines and, under the guidance of Aunt Gao, the reporter saw the tree.
Treasure trees are planted in small gardens, about 5 metres high, the thickest branches are about 30 centimetres long, leaves are green.

Comparison with the national and central regions based on some of the representative indicators of our provincial economy for 2005 and 2011

The lack of commensurate economic benefits from large investments is an important reason for the poor quality and efficiency of our economic growth.
In this regard, the experts recommend that effective measures be taken to encourage innovation in enterprises and that the scientific and technological results of universities and research institutes be "transferred" to enterprises in a timely manner.
