A 28-year-old cook was found dead in a mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who just moved to San Francisco was found dead this week in the stairwell at a local mall.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of who wanted to hurt him and said, "It's finally better."
The San Francisco coroner's office said that the body found at the Westfield mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
San Francisco Police Department claims that the death case was sentenced to him and was under investigation.
The victim's brother Louis Galileo said to KGO, the American Broadcasting Corporation radio station in San Francisco, Frank, who was a current cook in Boston six months ago, found an ideal job at Sons & Daughters' restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman at Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were "very shocked" about Frank's death.
The spokesman said, "We are a small team of close families, and we will miss him so much."
At this sad moment, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia claims Frank was initially living in the guest house, but recently, "It's finally better."
Louis Galicia told KGO, "Frank found an apartment while dating a girl."
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who wanted to hurt his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a wide heart.
Louis Galicia says, "Frank cooks dinners for his family."
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He's a follower.
Louis Galicia said, "All things in the world can go wrong, but Frank calls it a man who shines every day."
Call San Francisco Police to report 415-575-4444.
Primary doctors strike: call for new labour actions
The representative of primary doctors called on the Alliance to approve its new labour action against new contract disputes.
The British Medical Association Junior Doctors Committee will request all its members to support more labour operations since early September.
The Junior Doctors Committee stated that the ministers had not resolved their concerns about the contract.
Primary doctors and medical science were born in July to resist contract transactions with the British Medical Association.
Of the voting members, 58 per cent opposed the contract transaction.
Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Junior Doctors Committee, in a letter to members on Twitter on Thursday night, stated that the government was "sustained" for issues leading to the resistance of the contract.
She said: " In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Junior Doctors Committee has voted to reject the proposed new contract and called for formal consultations on all concerns ... "
In response to the Government ' s silence, the Executive Committee of Primary Doctors has officially requested today the British Medical Association Council to approve a long-term plan aimed at upgrading labour operations from early September.
The dispute has led primary doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first comprehensive strike in the history of the British National Medical Services System.
Dr. Johann Malawana, leader of the British Medical Association's junior doctor, resigned after the contract agreed terms recommended by the British Medical Association were rejected.
In a meeting before the 54,000 junior doctors and medical students voted, he said to members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be enforced among British medical personnel.
Russia and Turkey: "No Alliance"?
A gesture ended a crisis.
Russia met with Turkish leaders on Tuesday, who shook hands and announced the official end of eight months of saliva and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish President in a glorious hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I had a strong feeling that this settlement was the most promising sight of Ankara.
Yes, both sides did shake hands.
However, even according to the standards that Mr. Putin has been a light smile, almost undisclosed.
It was reported that Rejep Taip Eldoan mentioned "good friend" Putin five times.
I can't remember.
Meanwhile, he promised that relations with Russia would return to the level before the crisis, even to a higher level.
The next day, this newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdoan was acting like nothing happened.
But I think his passion suggests something opposite.
However, Mr. Putin continues to be cold that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow was very responsive.
Mr. Putin has been critical of the incident, accusing Ankara of being in the back of Moscow.
The attack from so-called friends is even more unacceptable.
It's hard for both sides to build real trust.
Since November, Russian opinion has also been reversed.
For months, government-controlled media have conducted an alarming and full-time attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Of these, the most serious is the accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdoan ' s family profited from illegal oil transactions in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He has categorically denied that statement.
However, the news from St. Petersburg shows that it's time to look forward.
After all, this meeting was provided that Putin received an apology from Turkish President Erdoan.
Russia can announce victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of truce are obvious.
First, Erdoan was driven off after the coup failed last month, so he needed the support of all his friends.
The constant terrorist attacks have obviously hit him a lot.
And there's an economic motive.
Russian sanctions hit Turkey, especially by prohibiting charter services that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen significantly by almost 90%.
As the flight recovers, Russian travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved.
They'll be at the end of the season of Mediterranean tourism.
The National Television even predicted this week that once Turkish agricultural imports were re-opened, the price of fruit and vegetables would decline.
A report from the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti says, "The tourists are gone, tomatoes are back."
For Moscow, the visit was also of additional political value.
Ankara is angry with the Western world's weak response to taking over.
Moreover, Ankara is dissatisfied with the slow progress of joining the EU negotiations and the long-standing involvement of Putin, and Putin is keen to use political coldness and weaken Turkey's relationship with the Western world.
Russian leaders will receive an additional score in Ankara because of the failure of the coup to the coup.
Attention, this is a gift for Moscow that has always been a deep fear of regime change.
So, the meeting held in this glorious beach palace has brought Russia and Turkey into allies with two countries that were rejected with abuse in the Western world, and an analyst described it as "Gig-in-in-the-the-the-the-go."
However, despite public reconciliation, there are significant differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow recently played a role in Syria, while Russia and Turkey supported the opposite.
It is foreseeable that after nearly three hours of preliminary conversation, the two presidents said at the launch that topic had not yet been addressed.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the issue of differences between the two sides, while Putin stressed it.
The parties have not reached a clear consensus on how to agree on how to agree on the Syrian issue.
It is a good thing to restart the dialogue again with the months of public hostility and causing a major disaster by Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has brought down Russian warplanes.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve outside Scotland.
According to the CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland, banks will be simplified into a logistics department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve outside Scotland.
Ross McYun told the BBC Scottish branch that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand was committed to its global ambition.
But eight years ago, he had to accept the rescue and gave up that pursuit since then.
In that time, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sports events by sponsoring the six-country football game and the Winbleton tennis championship champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to show more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish clients, but will not respond to what it is.
In England and Wales, all references outside the headquarters and stock exchange will be changed to the National West Min Temple Bank.
Alster Bank brand has been used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and the Autonomous Region of Northern Ireland.
There are other more prominent private bank brands, such as the Bank of Finance, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEun was interviewed on a tour of clients and employees in Inverness County.
He told the BBC Scotland Division that "The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employees employed brands, because we are now a bank with many brands."
Because the bank itself became an international brand, RBS became a global brand.
So far, what I'm saying is that we don't focus on the world, and we've turned our eyes to the mainland.
Each brand represents a difference in their respective industries, and our employees serve clients through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the six-country championship; at the same time, efforts have been made to enhance the image of different brands sponsored by sports events.
The CEO said, "Now it's time to become a multi-brand bank, because we've been exploring how to become a better bank that serves clients."
If we were three years ago to become a big bank with many brands will be mocked.
We're focusing on client needs and I believe you've noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands and it's right now.
Deturi won 3,000 jobs with the success of Predicating in Newmark.
Newmarket's two victories helped to win the 3,000th career, and then he sprayed champagne to celebrate.
Friday, the professional horse rider Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th victory in Newmarket.
He's been trying to practice John Gosden, and he's got two victories that night, and he won 3,000 jobs.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional horse rider who has achieved this milestone in the field of flatland.
The first five are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggot, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion of Ghayyar said, "It's special."
I'm excited because my family was there.
I'm glad I've achieved in Newmark, because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a big race, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's just a regular Friday night with 20,000 viewers.
I'm glad and humble.
Deturi brought the lead after the victory, and it caused the whole cheer.
In the area of the barrier, two riders have achieved this achievement, namely Richard Johnson, the champion rider, and Sir Anthony McCoy, the 20-time retired champion, in which Sir McCoy won over 4,300 in his record career.
Burger was the 9th German champion, winning 4,493 games in his career.
Deturi is one of the best riders of the day, so it's not surprising that he's achieved this milestone, and there were few people who had achieved this before.
He's fashionable, but he's really out of his tactical reason.
He was a great horsecraft ambassador, and his passion and charm have attracted a lot of fans to this movement for years.
A few weeks ago, I told DeTuri in Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend with a race rider, he should have won 6,000 games!
Seriously, it's too important to be the best horseman in England in 30 years.
He's a lively character, which is good for the British race, but besides, he's an incredible rider.
Deturi celebrates this milestone with its landmark jump-down movement.
From the jump line to jumping down the horse, Deturi has been a typical representative of the British flat field for 20 years.
His career is like a roller coaster.
He won a number of championships, including the famous "seven-win" won by the Royal Esco race in 1996, but he was also hit by a crash and was banned from taking drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the race after the six months of the ban, he was very tired, but he showed amazing character advantages and finally returned to the top, and he was a great match for those who were skeptical.
He may not have done it long -- Deturi said before he wanted to be at least before he was 50.
Russian President Putin dismissed the Chief of the Office of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin accidentally dismissed Sergei Ivanov's office as Director of the Office of the President.
Mr. Ivanov has been a member of the core group that Mr. Putin has trusted for years.
Ivanov, 63 years old, is now appointed as Special Representative on Environment and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin states that Mr. Putin has "declared the post of Director of the Russian President of Ivanov," but did not give a reason.
Anton Vaino, a deputy to Mr. Ivanov, was appointed as his successor in 2012.
Mr. Vaino is 44 years old, a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972, Tallinn, Estonian capital, graduated from the famous Moscow National Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he managed the President's draft and government staff, as the Kremlin website (using Russian).
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the government is to support the head of State in drafting legal and control instructions.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself asked for resignation and recommended Mr. Vaino to take over himself.
Is that a convincing smile?
Moscow is confused about this.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest assistants, working at the Soviet Security Bureau, like Putin.
As Director of the Office, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on national television, both of them called the Director of the Office himself asking for resignation.
Although there's a smile in front of the camera, it's almost nobody convinced -- especially at this time before the parliamentary election.
So, is this the result of some kind of power competition?
I can't know yet.
But the official statement -- a man who was once considered a presidential candidate suddenly chose to hold Russia's environmental policy -- has led many doubts.
Mr. Ivanov and Mr. Putin's conversation was quoted on the Kremlin website, saying, "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you to give me this difficult position, even a difficult position, a four-year term. "
"As a result, I've been the President's Office for four or eight months. "
Mr. Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Before that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He's a member of the Russian Security Committee and a former member of the National Security Agency, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin became Director of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency), Mr. Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
After Mr. Putin came to power, he appointed Mr. Ivanov as one of his most trusted five.
The outside world once believed that Mr. Ivanov might be President of Russia after Mr. Putin's second term, as the three re-elections were contrary to the Constitution.
But this position eventually belongs to another close assistant to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Before re-elected President three and a half years later, Mr. Putin served as Prime Minister of Russia.
The mystery fish is in shock, Banff, a garden.
A resident of Banff found fish in the garden and then sent help.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could have been scraped by a sea tornado.
Mr. Bain lives about 500 meters from the sea, and he released a video of this strange scene on Periscap, hoping someone could explain why these two-inch fish would come.
The Quince Ferry Bridge is now available to Fuff.
The project, which cost Pound1.350 million, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017
Engineers have connected the North Bridge of Queensferry Crossing to the High Bridge, which means that the bridge is now available to Faff.
The bridge wind machine, near the three bridgeheads of each bridge, is now close to completion, and the project is the first bridge.
The bridge that started in Fuff was 600 meters long, weighing 30,000 metric tons.
It uses 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 tilt lasos.
The project, which spends Pound1.350 million, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
The Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the scene today and became one of the first people to board the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment in the construction of the Quince Ferry Bridge."
We all witnessed engineering work on such a grand project, which uses over 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel in the building of the bridge alone.
Although the bridge is large and heavy, the completion of the coron between the bridge and the bridge requires fine work, which requires very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge is now installed, and the last concrete bridge on the bridge is pouring today in Rosyth, which means all bridges are ready.
Michael Martin, Director of the Quince Ferry Bridge Construction Company, said, "What bridge project is the first time the Dragon is a major milestone."
In the case of this remarkable project, the Dragon has shown the front line of civil engineering.
After installing the last circuit panel and connect it to the expanded North Bridge fort Road Panel, the remaining gap between the north side or near the land side.
The operation will require 700 mm south of the northern high-rise bridge.
It's a huge job, and it's a very sophisticated job.
It's huge because the high bridge is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 metric tons, and it needs to pull an slope of about 3%.
It's sophisticated because the engineering team needs to make sure the deviation is very small, and it's only a few millimeters on each side.
It's a relief that everything's going well.
Simon Bayers picked up the female gymnastics champion.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the fire.
Simone Biles is not affected by all this.
It's alive when you jump.
There's more to balance the upper blade.
Free gymnastics are amazing.
The whole thing was a great job.
Now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnastics won the full-power champion on Thursday, showing her talent in gymnastics in gymnastics.
She's a big silver winner with 62.198, the Final Five, Aly Raisman and the copper winner, Aliya Mustafina.
Simon Byers from the United States performed a balanced wood show at the special finals of the 2016 Summer Gymnastics women at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bayers helped the American team achieve a four-time crown on the Olympic women's gymnastics, who personally won five medals at this Olympics, further confirming her generation, or the best gymnastics ever.
When I saw her share, Bayers couldn't help but cry, and she finally ended this long journey.
Byers was therefore among the "Twen decades of athletes" like Michael Phelps, raising sports projects in their respective fields to new heights:
Bayers has been a game for the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including ten gold medals. She's been training daily hard to reach higher accuracy. Mary Lou Retton, the 1984 Olympic champion, said, "Bays is the best gymnasst I've ever seen."
There's the last game in Brazil, but it's not about Byers' competition with other gymnastics, it's more than her own fight with the pressure of great expectations.
If Bayers hadn't returned to her house in Spring, Texas, you'd be very disappointed.
Simon Bayers (left) from the United States hugged each other, and they won gold medals and silver medals at the 2016 Summer Gymnastics Women's All-power Finals at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Byers won his first gold medal on Tuesday, and gave a surprise to Martha Karoliyi, the upcoming national team coach.
Although Bayers insisted that he didn't plan the future in the long-time occupation of the championship, it was not exactly like this.
The part of Bayers' free gymnastics -- including her landmark flipping, with Latin music, which is what she heard in her distance with the Rio Olympic Hall.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by grandparents during the baby and was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman on a field trip to a gym, has now grown into a strong force.
Byers hasn't missed the game since summer 2013, and she'll win if she wants to win.
Mustafina's two rotations is just an illusion.
The world champion of the coronation of wood and free gymnastics is ambushed.
Her balance wood score 15.433, free gymnastics score 15.933.
When he was waiting for the final score, Lesman held Byers gently, and when Bayers learned what he wanted, he left tears.
Lesman's performance was kind of like revenge four years ago, when she was third, but lost to Mustafina in the final game.
But this time, this 22-year-old captain, called Grandma, was far ahead of the American play.
She flew to the crowd after the free gymnastics and declared her return, but sometimes there was doubts.
Since earlier this week, its news has spread like the virus on Twitter.
Mahaj Brown, six years old, survived the Philly shooting.
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old child in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child shot was Mahaj Brown.
They say Brown's abdominal ditch, legs, arms and abdomen, there's a lot of gunshot wounds, but the kid was sober on the way to the hospital.
"He's been guilty, a little body was hit by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez said to the TV station.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in critical condition in the hospital and had been operated on several occasions.
His family told the TV that the kids were expected to recover.
He was going to start studying first grade in a local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people shot in the Germantown area.
Of the three other people shot, two were 29 years old and 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims are in critical condition; two other victims are stable.
According to the TV station, the child and the victim of the 29-year-old situation were found in the front seat of the car.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether there were shooters among the wounded.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like a gunman.
A lot of offensive weapons were found on the scene, which would infer them to use different offensive weapons.
So, this is certainly a continuous war.
There's bullet shells on both sides of the street.
"So, so, there were several armed men on the scene in a state of war," said Anthony Ginaldi to the TV station.
There are many houses and vehicles damaged in the area.
No capture operations have been carried out, and the police are reportedly watching surveillance footage.
Tuesday, there was a six-year-old child who was shot in his arm while playing at the door of the West Oak Lane community.
She's recovering. The police are still chasing suspects.
Why do we need Simon, Gabrielle and Larry?
That's how I judge the women's gymnastics this year, for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I've been at every summer Olympics, but America has never been the dominant position.
Second, the gymnastics team has three good gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have been inspiring a lot of colored girls.
The formation of this team is proud of everyone, because it contains Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian.
This team finally looks like the American team.
It also consolidated the peak of black and Latin women in this movement.
In the last four years, the first gymnastics have been African Americans.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle split first, second.
This is amazing.
Last Olympic Games, Gabriel Douglas, "unexpectedly" became the Olympic champion, which made America cheering.
Now, the world can witness the wonderful performance of three world champions, Simon Byers, Douglas and Laure Hernandez, who have made routine gymnastics.
Thursday, Simon helped the American team achieve a four-time crown on the women's personal power project.
Her teammate Ali Lesman won the silver medal.
We're at the top of this campaign, but not in the National Gymnastics class.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie are on the same way as Ali and Madison.
They're Final Five, because the next Olympic gymnastics will be made up of four gymnastics, the last year of Marta Karoliyi.
But the reality is that gymnastics are expensive sports, and gymnastics are trained mainly at private gymnastics clubs, and their parents need to pay training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel costs (including coaches and gymnastics and family costs) and the cost list is increasing.
Most gymnastics clubs are located in the rich suburbs that can support the industry.
All the training of gymnastics is done in these clubs, and it's a long-term cost for gymnastics' families.
The coach of Bayers, Aimee Boorman, and the coach of Hernndez, Maggie Haney, have been teaching them since these gymnastics started practicing gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable, more accessible gymnastics training to young girls that are influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laure.
Twenty years ago, I set up my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we provide free, cheap gymnastics to over 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Spanish Americans) in the black residential area and to develop national and world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this great Olympic movement with high-quality gymnastics.
Gymnastics help to develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, and also help to develop a spirit of patience, self-regulation and determination.
These can bring life benefits to a person's health, academic and successful work.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
It's important to participate in the campaign, especially for girls.
It's an exciting moment.
Thank Simon, Ali, Laure, Gabriel, Gabriel and Madison for winning the Olympic group's gold medal, and thank them for inspiring young girls with so many different backgrounds to open the way to health, strength, success.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, the junior doctor plans to launch a further strike.
Ministers initially wanted to end this change-induced dispute by accepting a contract modified by the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 primary doctors who voted against the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt revealed the plan to enforce the contract, saying that the British National Medical Services System (NHS) is currently in a "vacuum zone" and that a little delay would undermine the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first refers to the revision of primary doctors and weekend work practices to improve care for irregular working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Junior Doctors Committee, said in a statement: "The primary doctor still has serious concern about the proposed contract, particularly worried that it would exacerbate the current labour crisis and failed to treat all doctors fairly. "
It's only eight weeks before the first doctors signed the new contract, and we need to make progress.
BMA works to resolve disputes through negotiation, but people are reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government responds with silence.
Nevertheless, just last month we got Jeremy Hunt's promise, and he said his door was always open.
"Jerimi Hunt needs to take action now to eliminate enforcement and solve the concerns of the junior doctor."
If he doesn't, the junior doctor clearly says they're ready to take further labour action.
The last strike took place at the end of April, leading to nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and consultations covered the doctor on the front.
The ministers initially wanted to end this change-induced dispute by accepting the modified contract of BMA.
BMA wants to get better weekend wages for 54,000 primary doctors involved in the contract.
NHS Employers CEO Daniel Mortimer called on the junior doctor to stop playing any strike.
Mr. Mortimer said: "The labour operation is very effective, but instead of putting pressure on the teams and services that have been fully committed, leading to fear, concern and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families. "
Over the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Doctors Committee and actively responding with the Ministry of Health and other departments to their concerns about the role and reporting of guardianships.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics — such as deployment, training flexibility, other training costs, training costs, common awareness of curriculum outline, study leave and gender wage differences in the field of medical care, which illustrate employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health for the agreement reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day can reduce the threat of heart attack.
Officials suggested that a drug of Pound2 a day be extended to more patients and to extend the time to take the medication, and thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from this drug.
Anti-condensation drugs can reduce the risk of heart disease re-emergence for heart disease patients.
The drug lasts 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or heart disease.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE) under the British National Medical Services System (NHS) recommends that patients continue to take four years of medication to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, NHS regulatory agency NICE recommends that patients continue to take drugs for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease every year, one quarter of which continue to experience a re-emergence or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fat matter in an artery wall sediment.
If the spots are broken, it leads to a embolism, and it's blocking the blood flow into the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the embolism moves, it goes into the blood flow, and it's blocking the flow of blood into the brain, causing strokes.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack are more risky.
Made of the British company AstraZeneca, sold in the name of Brilicque, can reduce the risk of disease by reducing the formation of embolism.
The NICE draft, released today, suggests that patients take 90 mg of Kagrai for 12 months, and 60 mg a day for Kagray and two aspirin in the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: " Despite effective secondary preventive treatment, as many as a quarter of patients with a history of heart attack can often have serious consequences. "
Fear of re-emergence can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence suggests that taking the risk of heart disease and strokes for those patients who have experienced a heart attack can effectively reduce the risk of having a heart attack.
We are pleased that the temporary recommendation of Kagray will provide more treatment options for thousands of beneficiaries.
As information on the effectiveness and safety of the treatment and safety after three years, especially the risk of haemorrhage, the draft guidance does not recommend that treatment be continued after this period.
Computer culture has made "election fraud" a Muslim region.
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, promoted the publication of a government report for corruption last year.
The culture of "political correctness" has led to the widespread electoral fraud in the Muslim community, which revealed today.
Sir Eric Pickles, former Cabinet Minister, accused the police of the election regulators and city halls of ignoring evidence of abuse of elections for "oversensitive to ethnic division and religious issues".
The former Minister of Community Affairs, currently anti-corruption, has stated that the practice of threatening voters with religious positions has had a bad impact and the police should be allowed to set a perimeter outside the polling station to protect the brave voters.
He suggested that voters vote with IDs to confirm their identity.
For now, voters just have to report their names and addresses.
The report even suggested that the ink on the voters' fingers be unpainted to prevent a second vote.
Sir Eric said that the protection of the whistleblower should be increased.
He called for an increase in media access to conference documents and decisions made by unofficial committees or working groups.
"It's not just to prevent electoral fraud, but to protect local governments from a broad culture of corruption and the poison of financial fraud closely linked to them," he said.
This report was issued after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that a series of corruption and violations in the office of mayor Rahman should be dismissed.
The court found that Rahman "very ridiculously abused" the religious emotions of the Muslim community and closed the allegations of swords against his racial discrimination and Islamic phobia.
Lahman "in the election was said to have declared him a religious obligation to vote for loyal Muslims."
As many as 300 ballot papers are suspicious, maybe voters faked others to vote.
Sir Eric said there was evidence that there was electoral fraud throughout the country.
He specifically warned of the fraud of the mail elections, and senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on voters and forced them to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric (in the photo) made a number of suggestions for the clean-up mechanism, including a good identity card to confirm his identity.
In his report, "The evidence shows that senior members, particularly senior members in Pakistan and Bangladesh background communities, put pressure on vulnerable groups, especially women and young people, to vote as they wish ... "
"As a result of the excessive sensitivity of ethnic division and religious "political correctness", they fear that State institutions will ignore such acts ... "
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the electoral mechanism, including the prohibition of political activists to process mail voting documents to stop the "voting harvest".

The talkator Byron MacDonald made his own opinion when the women's 4x200 meters free swim relays ended, when he thought his microphone was turned off.
The audience heard the CBC team, Byron, who wears colored glasses commentator, said, "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
Because it's too exciting, it's faster than the stinking hair, but then it's as slow as a pig.
Thanks to her.
Chinese swimmer, 14 years old, is the second best, with 1 minute 57 seconds 79 -- 1.61 seconds behind Canada, and then narrows the Canadian team to narrow the gap with China.
The whole Canadian audience was shocked by the tone and wording of this interpreter, and they reacted on the Internet very quickly.
Emmett Macfarlane pushed, "The CBC interpreter said that Chinese 14-year-old swimmer "slow like a pig"?
This idiot didn't realize it was live.

So, the wording is inappropriate. Byron is sorry.

"Of course, I don't mean disrespect, I'm sorry."
Primark, the customer was angry at a woman who tried his underwear in the middle of the store.
A woman was in the middle of a Primark shop, and the customers in the store didn't know where to look.
Worse still, she looked at herself and then took off her underwear and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to view the shelf and eventually tested four underwear in this shop at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
The woman was testing his underwear in the Bouverie Place mall in Bolkestone, and then put it back on the shelf.
And Jenny Davidson in the store said that after testing underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and then walked out of the store and didn't buy anything."
She said, "Everyone can't believe what they see."
She was standing in the middle of the store, took off a underwear from the shelf, took off her tights and underwear, and then she put it on.
"She didn't try to find a hidden place to try through -- she was just standing there, and it was shameless."
"When she took off her underwear again, everyone was shocked. Apparently, she was not satisfied because she put her underwear back on the shelf."
And then she tried three of them like this, and finally found out she didn't like it, and then dressed again and walked out of the store.
"She doesn't seem to care about someone looking at her -- or she never thought who'd finally buy the underwear she tried through."
Ms. Davidson, living in Kent town, said, "It's disgusting to think that someone else will buy someone who's going through and not being cleaned."
This happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "When she leaves, the clerk obviously had to deal with these underwear, fortunately. "
"I hate buying a new underwear home, but I find another woman trying through and not cleaned up."
A spokesman for Primark said, "Primark knows what happened in our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th."
All problematic goods are down.
How to protect yourself with a gun attack.
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may bring you a little security.
We ask the master of the Krav Maga Federation, Rhon Mizrachi, to learn how to deal with the perpetrators at close range.
Whether he's from front or behind, the video will teach you how to win.
Mizrachi says if the shooter comes near you from behind, all you have to do is turn around so you can see the assailant and "clean the line."
Then, hold the gun with your forearm and shoulder and hit the assailant face with your elbow.
Then he put his knee on his abdomen, and when the attacker bends down his body because of pain, turn the gun in his hand, hit him in the face with a barrel and a rear gun, and keep the weapon on him.
If the shooter comes near the front, you use similar techniques -- to keep your body within the line, take the gun and reverse the gun so that the shooters can't fire.
Meanwhile, press weight on the gun and hit the assailant's chest and reverse the gun from his tight hand and then pointed the gun at him.
Sounds complicated?
Look at the video and see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, if you're not a master of Maga, the safest way to get rid of the robbery is to hand over the gold.
A gangster family destroyed a rental house in Soltash, Cornwall County.
A hooligan family expelled by intimidation of neighbors damaged his rental house before leaving, causing a loss of 50,000 pounds.
After a long complaint, Tanya Skeldon and his husband Shaun Trebilcock were expelled from a rental rental house in Soltash, Cornwall County.
After being forced from the residence, housing association officials were surprised to find it seriously damaged.
There's holes all over the wall, the floor is torn, the garbage is thrown all over the ground, the walls are all messy.
After the expulsion, the family had been moving, and it is said to be living in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, the house manager of the Cornwall County Housing Association, said she was worried that the house would no longer be saved.
She said, "It's a nightmare for people living here, and I don't think people can live like this."
There are a lot of things that need to weigh because this house is likely to be a bad element in Cornwall County.
The family is notorious, and their names are also notorious.
The couple has three sons, they'll live here from time to time, and the police say that the terrorist acts of this family include fighting on the streets using baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug trafficking, yelling, arguing and curse.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received an antisocial act resolution.
In this house that could be dismantled, many rooms are filled with garbage for a long time.
In this room where drugs were traded, the floor was lifted.
Neighbors say they often see them fighting on the streets and often call the police.
After giving them a 11-week extension to keep them voluntarily, the Cornwall County Housing Association forced her and her husband out of the house this week.
Finally, the neighbors cheered for it, and they said that life was hell.
A neighbor said, "They don't care about anyone."
We lived next door for 20 years, and it's been so bad.
We've seen the police come in a million times.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep."
We're up early because it's too quiet here -- we're not used to it!
They finally left. That's great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, community executive manager of the Cornwall County Housing Association, said that the family had not been able to cooperate with the local government.
The family lived in this house for 20 years, and the police visited them a lot.
Garbage and old toys were thrown on the side of the cheap rental of weeds.
He added: " Unfortunately, the tenant has not held any responsibility for her actions with her family, and expulsion is the last consideration of the Cornwall County Housing Association. "
It's a very difficult case because they're acting very extreme, and what they do must make the neighbors feel very scared.
I thank my team for his work, and thanks to Devon and Cornwall County Police and community members who have bravely provided us with information.
I hope this will bring some comfort to the neighbors and convey the message that we will not tolerate antisocial acts.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said their three sons lived in this house for different times, but they said they were in their 20s.
After they were expelled, one of the bedroom floors threw a dirty mattress.
The housing association workers will soon clean up piles of garbage around the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house, found over 70 grams of marijuana, and found scales, drug use equipment and Pound1,700 in cash.
After plead, Skeldon was fined for holding B-type drugs and drug trafficking.
She claims that money was used to buy gravestones for Lee Skeldon, son who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that after being homeless, Tanya and his husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the house are full of graffiti.
Police say they'll expel tenants who disobey the Tenant Rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall County Police said this expulsion issued a clear warning to other tenants who continued to disobey tenants.
"This warning is directed at those who think their actions will not be blamed and those who have been destroyed by such acts," she said.
Devon and Cornwall County Police will not tolerate crime and antisocial behaviour, and they will continue to work together to protect our communities.
Reed: If Hillary was elected President, he would nominate Garland to enter the Supreme Court.
Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic Leader, said he was convinced that if the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to enter the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have stopped confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said that the next president would choose the person to replace the late Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at a teleconference on Thursday that Hilary would choose Garland, "some credibility".
A woman spokesman from Reed then said that Reed had not nominated Garland to talk directly to Hilary and said he was just guessing.
He appreciated Garland and said Hilary's team didn't want to "smuggle" because of the new guy.
Garland is the chief judge of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Reed said that Republicans who stopped Garland's nomination were the "point" and "convenor" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit to be president.

The French court dismissed the petition for the demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp.
A French court rejected a petition from the Government of Gale's intention to dismantle dozens of temporarily built shops and restaurants in the jungle camp.
At the Court ' s hearing this week, the Gale Government argued that the French Government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporarily built shops in the refugee camp. People sell goods from cigarettes to energy beverages in refugee camps, provide hairdressing services and sell tea at 50 cents (40 pences) in restaurants or selling basic meals at a price of several euros.
The Governor's Office of Gale believes that these places should be dismantled because they are non-taxed parallel economies and also fire and health hazards.
Humanitarian groups have indicated to the courts that these shops and restaurants are of great importance, as free food provided by national-supported associations and other groups does not meet the growing refugee needs of the refugee camp.
They claim that these temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
A court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operators of the 72 temporary stores, but said that the Governor Garret was "a complete understanding".
Judge Jean Fran-ois Molla said that these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants were much more than simply providing food to refugees living under extremely dangerous conditions.
He said these places were calm points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites threatened by demolition is the Jungle Book Kids cafe in the camp, which provides 200 food, English and French courses per day, and provides asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect this cafe.
A letter to Guardian wrote that closing this cafe would be a disaster for these children. "

On 11th, a number of enterprises came to the Qingdao City Defile Trading Centre to submit a requisition for sewage rights, and the requisition will pay for its reimbursed use fees.
The first list of transactions to be completed also predicts the official opening of the pilot work on the Qingdao sewage trade, which will also be the first list of the provincial sewage trade and the national urban sewage trade.
On the morning of 11th, Zhao Su-ping, General Manager of Qingdao Twin Peach Fine Chemical (Group) Ltd., arrived at the Qingdao City Defile Trading Centre to submit a claim for sewage rights.

That is, the legal means of combating environmental violations and severely punishing the enterprise's super-standard sewage, thereby protecting the environment and guarantees public health.
Now businesses have increased the motivation of pollution for their own interests, cherishing limited sewage rights and reduce pollutants emissions.

Emission rights, also known as "emission rights", are the right to release pollutants, which means the right of emissions to the environment within the level of government distribution.
This right is essentially the right of sewage to possession, use and benefits of environmental capacity resources.
Next, if the total amount of pollutants emissions does not exceed allowed emissions, the internal sources of pollution are adjusted by currency exchange.

Girl Zhang Binbin: "Beautiful hand" started shooting career "reverse."
Zhang Donghong, East Park Village, Xiamen, changed his 29-inch old TV to 65 inches of television.
The daughter of this ordinary farmer is Zhang Binbin, who won the 50-metre silver medal for China on the night of 11th.
On 11th night, in front of this new TV, the Zhang Donghongs and dozens of relatives and friends witnessed the journey of her daughter, and from almost the pre-game to almost reverse the magic process.
In the game that day, Zhang Binbin once ranked down, seems to be very far from the finals.
But parents and family and friends didn't give up, and they kept brushing the text, and saw that as other players ended the race, Zhang Binbin was raised all the way, and eventually locked the final seat, and his home broke out from a cheer.
In the finals, Zhang Binbin was once after the ranking, the last few more and more steady, winning silver cards with a backward champion of 0.2.
Zhang Binbin, 27 years old, in 16 years of shooting, almost passed the silver medal that was not easy to pass.
His mother Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that when they hesitated, Zhang Binbin found a few novelists in the same village.
These novelists were the same village kids who were recommended for training at the same year, and the cousin of Zhang Binbin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once returned to Shang An's school for reasons of family difficulties.
But after his founding coach Zhang Yajie worked repeatedly, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin came home again because he couldn't get into the national team.
This time, not only Coach Zhang Yaji, the leader and coach of the Shanmen shooting arrow and the Fujian team came to the house, and eventually advised Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Like yesterday's game, the girl who insisted on a reverse on the shooting road.
"Every coach chooses the team differently, when I saw Binbin's hands look beautiful, and they just hit each other."
Zhang Donghong also remembered that in the training test, while not the best, the number of rings was stable, and that was also important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches.
In training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yaji was the input of the farmer girl.
He recalled that Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, and the team was training on a permanent gun lifting, asking the team to be unable to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was a quiet, good kid who had liked painting and homemade hand-made toys since I was a kid.
"I'll make clothes at home, sew up, and Binbin will pick up some edges and make my own doll."
She said that a daughter often sews her own hand-to-hand toys, and she's good at drawing, from five officers to dress, and she's always alive.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family are so small, they can only go home on holidays.
Parents say that Zhang Binbin rarely talks about their hard work, and more about their parents.
I don't usually see a daughter, and parents are very careful with their daughter's children's paintings and the honors of the years.
Zhang Xiaolong showed her daughter's moving comic book to the press, "If she hadn't been a shooting athlete, she should continue drawing."
And in the second floor of Zhang Binbin's living room, there's a cabinet full of medals, medals and certificates she won.
Zhang Dong-hong put the medals and medals together, and the certificate was kept in the folder, "These are all honors that have been changed for a decade, and we all cherish it."
Recently, the Hebei Province Tsing Hyo Foundation sent $16,000 to the hands of six lost families in the villages of Ii Yiu County, the station head, Guiquan and so on.
This is another condolence from the Fund to society after the search for children and children and the lonely elderly in the flood of 7.19.
7.19 Heavy rainfall caused many lands in Hebei Province, resulting in floods and deaths and disappearances in parts of the province.
The good man, Old Iron, who died of helping the small zone's duty drain, left a 2-year-old young child and a wife with a six-armed wife, who touched the whole province and the city.
On August 4, the Hebei Tzu Hyo Foundation staff and Hebei brand volunteers came to the house of the good man Old Iron and gave $3,200 to the family of Old Iron.
When the Vice President of the Brand Council, Yeli learned about the status of the old Iron family, it was decided to conduct a "love sale" campaign in the branding business members, helping the Old Iron family to work together.
Hebei Province Tzu Hyo Foundation, known as the Hebei Volunteer Foundation, Tzu Hyo Foundation, launched by the Hebei Brands Preparatory Committee and was established in August 2015.
According to the Hong Kong Daily Oriental Daily, the sale of diamonds in the interior is currently three major problems, including the net push of the false diamond, the weight of the false diamond, the lack of security after sale, etc.
Antwerp is one of the largest diamond trading centres in the world, and the diamond cutting technology of local craftsmen is well known, and the diamonds sold were strictly identified and welcomed by the Inland Lady.
"A small bag, holding in a small group of light, worth nearly a million dollars," a mother of Liu, who was involved in the purchase of diamonds, describing her experience in Antwerp this June.
She said she hid the diamonds in her underwear, went to the bathroom for a few days in a row, and she was very nervous to walk.
She called the diamonds bought in Antwerp at about $55,000 per carat, and the same quality diamond was about $11,000 in the retail price of the gate.
She sold all the diamonds bought by 20%, and made $200,000 at a time.
According to the Customs of the Mainland, diamonds are not supplies or essentials in their travel, so they are in the category of goods and are declared when entering or leaving or listed as smuggling, and the situation may be sentenced to prison.
According to foreign media reports, on 10 local time, the British Prime Minister's office, Downing Street, announced that British Prime Minister Teresa May would spend the summer vacation in Switzerland, but did not reveal the specific leave.
According to the media, after the British referendum, the new British Prime Minister chose to go to the "neutral" Switzerland on the continent, with some kind of policy symbolic.
The British Guardian commented that the symbol of the representative of this neutral country played a role in the choice of the first British Prime Minister's resort.
The British Daily Telegraph commented that Teresa May chose to go to Switzerland for the first time after Mrs. Thatcher, the first time British Prime Minister had been on vacation in Switzerland.
The choice of two female prime ministers and two male prime ministers of Blair and Cameron liked to go to hotter places.
According to the information received, the new British Prime Minister Teresa May will return to London on August 24th, and then wait for her to be a series of important jobs and activities.
The British Parliament will resume on September 5, with the subject of the debate, including the second De-European referendum requested online.
On June 23rd, the British referendum decided to de-European, but the new British Prime Minister was reluctant to launch paragraph 50 of the member States concerned about the Lisbon Treaty by the end of the year.
The existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan City, all of which are the first in the province.
Since the non-genetics of the culture of emblems are largely dependent on oral transmissions, many of the non-recovered transmissions, the use of digital technology preservation and protection is essential.
In accordance with the main points of work of the Provincial People ' s Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to hear the consideration of the report of the work and conduct of the implementation of the banking oversight and management law to serve local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research teams to some municipalities to prepare for thematic inquiries.
Hana Jian Hui noted that the Provincial Standing Committee heard and considered the report of the vertical management department and conducted thematic inquiries for the first time in my province as an active exploration of strengthening and expanding the monitoring of the people.
In Xinjiang Kash's exercise director, with the director's orders, the military forces in Kash, U.S. in Kash and Tan, Aksu were quickly following the guidance instructions to implement mobile assembly and went to the field of the exercise.
China's Mars program is here.
Our Mars exploration mission is going to be surrounded, landing, patrol, and this form never goes abroad.
Our Mars detection target is to circle, land, patrol, and this mission is quite difficult.
Because Mars detection takes 26 months to meet a time window, experts are working closely to launch our first Mars detector in 2020.
According to Xu Da-chul, although our aircraft has entered deep space, the completion of Mars detection is indispensable, and the detection of Mars means that China is truly entering the deep-air detection age.
" Every two or three years, there is only one chance of Mars from Earth, and the launch of Mars detectors at this point is the most energy-efficient for launch rockets ... "
" Given the quality of the Mars probe, our Long March 5 launch vehicle will complete the launch mission ... "
Our Mars exploration mission is going to be surrounded, landing, patrol, and this form is never going abroad, and it is proposed to be surrounded and landed abroad, but landing failed.
Mars detection involves a lot of technical areas, especially, although Mars is a space detector, it has distinct characteristics compared to the general space detector.
That means that the Mars probe must have the ability to determine the route and detect the risk of the barrier.
Pong Shi Ho, a researcher at the Chinese Space Science and Technology Group, said that humans were so popular with Mars detection because the detection of Mars had important scientific, technological, and even related to the future of humanity.
Mars has now become the most human research planet but the Earth, and the history of human exploration using space detectors for Mars almost runs through the entire human space history.
So, humans want to build a base on Mars one day, and eventually emigrate to Mars and turn it into a second home for mankind.
There are a lot of signs that Mars was likely to have been like the current Earth, only after billions of years of evolution that became thin, low temperatures, water depletion, etc.
Therefore, research on the detection or manned landing on Mars can be presented to prevent the Earth from becoming a second Mars that is difficult to survive.
As of June 2016, 114 moon detections were conducted worldwide, 43 Mars detections.
However, since the 1990s, humans have conducted 18 Mars detections, while the moon detected only 14 times.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars Rovers working, but only one Moon Orbitor and a Moon Lander are working.
The world's space power has developed a detection program targeting Mars systems, thus showing that today's Mars detection is hoter than the moon detection.
On November 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars detector, Mangarian, became the first country in Asia to successfully detect Mars.
Mangarian is used to study Mars surfaces, atmospheric and mineral characteristics, to find signs of methane and life on Mars.
The hardest part of this mission is that the probes are only one chance to slow down the gas and parachutes after the Mars atmosphere.
According to Sun Zechu, the master designer of the Mars detector at the 5th House of China Space Technology Group, the Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges.
Mars' atmospheric pressure is low, only 1% of the Earth's surface atmospheric pressure, with high uncertainty.
Scientists have not yet learned about its changes and the characteristics of storms.
Mars often forms dust storms like Earth's sand weather in summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar light energy received by the Mars car, and must design a hibernation model for the Mars car to keep it patiently waiting for the duststorm.
At the same time, the Mars atmosphere has a reduction in solar light, which poses a challenge to the energy supply detected by Mars.
This requires a larger solar wing of the probe and needs to be adjusted to move towards the direction of the sun.
And, Mars surface gravity is only 38% of the Earth, but most gravity than the surface of the moon, so the probe needs greater power.
"The most central and difficult place for this Mars detection mission is the process of the probe entering the atmosphere of the air-activated shape and parachute slowdown in Mars, with only one opportunity to ensure success ... "
Sun Zechu said that, because the Earth is far away from Mars, the whole process cannot be controlled in real time by the ground, it must be done by detectors.
Because there are not so many thrusters to offset the speed of landing on Mars, the slowdown depends on the Mars atmosphere, but the atmosphere of Mars is difficult to simulate on the ground.
Pang-ho said that, in general, the way to detect Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon, and it's "turn, fall, patrol, return," and eventually achieves the goal of landing on Mars.
As Mars is far away from Earth than the moon, detection of Mars needs to attack a series of more complex technologies.
According to Taiwan media reports, the Director of Administration Lin announced yesterday morning that "party parties and their accompanying organizations have inappropriate access to property disposal regulations" effective today.
The Vice President of the National Party, Jian Kai-hyun, said, "A national party with a social commitment and responsibility for over a hundred years, will not fall down like this."
Lin stressed that if political parties, with provisions under violations of regulations, such as the organization or trustee, the Committee will investigate and "in accordance with the law" and "law" ...
Lin also announced the election of the Vice-President of the Party Production Commission, which will be held by Hong Bacon, Deputy Administrator of the Department of Integrity.
He said that Guo Li-hung was the main committee of the Party Production Committee, and that the experience of Hong Bacon in the past to check major cases in question would be the basis for the Commission's identification of relevant misconduct cases.
Jian Kai-hyun believes that no one will give you social donations today, and if the party is taken away, the National Party can just ask for social support and sponsorship, "No one has a chance today."
Jian Kai-hyun also stressed that even after the party property regulations went on, the National Party was not fully charged and confiscated, and the rest would be donated as promised to make the party zero, and the party would start from scratch.
Original title: "Dr. Corridor" Lan Viet Feng v. Wang Chi-Ann's honour violation was lost.
The legal evening news was told by the host Wang Chi-Ann in Sina Weibo, who spoke to the Court of the Court by Lan Viet Feng, Wang Chi-Ann and Beijing Micro-Dream Genesis Network Technology Ltd.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haydian Court sentenced the case to determine that Wang Chi-Ann and Wei-Mong did not constitute a violation and dismissed all requests for proceedings at Lan Viet Peak.
In early 2014, the survey of journalist Wang Chi-An found that, despite the fact that, despite the media being shaped as a sad hero of institutional pressure, although more than 600 days in the hospital corridor was shaped by the media, there was a lot of false information.
On March 29, 2014, the "The Corridor Doctor" programme, produced by the news survey, was broadcast.
The so-called overmedical information reported to the media by Lan Viet Feng has no evidence of support.
Wang Zhi-an also described in the real-named microblogging that "The point of Lan Viet Peak is a character, with a clear paranoid personality."
Lan Viet Feng asked Wang Chi-Ann to delete Twitter, apologize to him and compensate for the comfort of mental damage of $100,000.
In the trial, both sides had provoked whether Wang Chi-Ann violated the reputation of Lan Viet Peak.
12: The Chinese team is busy with the four bikes to break.
The bike is expected to achieve the Olympic gold medal "zero breakthrough," and the girl's foot girl will challenge the German team of two world champions, looking forward to the cold.
Wang Town has been prominent in the last two seasons, and last year the Beijing Field World Championship won silver medals, and the group won the World Championship in May this year.
According to foreign media reports, 27-year-old Korean archer Zhang Hui-jin won gold medals in the women's arrow-shooting personal competition, and then won the Olympic gold medal after the group, and became the crown king.
Zhang Hui-jin was considered a big, late-time player who regretted not getting tickets to the last London Olympics, and now she is proud to stand on the highest stage of Rio Olympics.
Zhang Hui-jin won the gold medal in the finals of the women's arrow-shooting personal competition at the Sanba Avenue Stadium in Rio Samba Avenue, Brazil, with a total score of 6-2.
She didn't shoot for the first time in fourth grade, and she didn't get the first personal gold medal at the World Cup in 2014 and was a late player.
Zhang Hui-jin recalled, "There was no level in high school so I couldn't be able to compete throughout the country.
Zhang Hui-jin won only fourth in the London Olympic Games four years ago, losing the Olympic ticket, and only two gold medals for colleagues and friend Chifu.
Zhang Hui-jin spoke of her golden gain after the women's arrow-shooting personal award ceremony, "until the end, it's probably a good result and satisfaction.
28-year-old Korean arrow "One Sister" and the winner of the London Olympic Arrow personal gold medal won the copper medal.
Chiftbe lost to Zhang Hui-jin in the semi-finals, and he fought for a copper medal with Mexican player Alexandra Valencia.
Chiftbe is making sure that the gold burden is hidden after the copper medal.
First, the coaches have accumulated extensive experience in continuous research, followed by scientific training, which require long-term accumulation.
The Arrows train, night crossing the cemetery, etc. help the team focus and remain normal.
Although it has not been confirmed, many sources say that Apple's launch in autumn 2016 will be held in September, and iPhone7 is coming.
Although Apple did not respond, the new iPhone function, the configuration has been released, even online with the iPhone7 "real model" picture.
The new generation of iPhone is called "the crowd of eyes," hot, tight, rich and rich... if you want to buy the real first time, you have to choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
It exacerbates people's disappointment with new phones, "It's growing, but it can't project holograms! This generation of iPhone is terrible."
The iPhone7 was accompanied by countless secrets before birth.
In addition, there are several sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will cancel 3.5 mm earphone interfaces and switch to bluetooth connections and charge interfaces, which will provide space for apples to add a second speaker.
Another evidence that supports this message is that Apple allowed headphone manufacturers to produce earphone products connected through charging interfaces as early as 2014.
The message is true or fake, and the answer will not be revealed until the Apple release in autumn 2016.
But this does not prevent industry from looking at the iPhone7 prospects -- many people believe that iPhone7 will be the last major upgrade of Apple to the iPhone series.
Although the market share of iPhone has declined in terms of data published by the recent market research institute IDC.
Among them, Goldman Sachs kept Apple's stock "buying" rating, while BMO analysts think iPhone7 will reap a historic sales performance.
And the CEO Hock Tan of Botton also said that the future increase in apples would be over 20 per cent, which was entirely due to the launch of iPhone7.
Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to buy iPhone7, while only 4% of the number of people planned to buy iPhone6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20 per cent of the user groups currently holding iPhone6 or 6Plus are planning to buy iPhone7, a fairly high percentage.
Second, there's an expert analysis that most of the fruit powders like to replace their iPhone phone in the next generation.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e. iPhone, which has been almost 120 million users for two years.
According to the media, Taiwan experienced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone7, "the damage to the power production facility is more damaged than imagination and could have an impact on the initial iPhone7 supply. "
Supply and demand contradictions affect ordinary users. It's time to choose a good channel, with the first low price of the iPhone7.
According to the source, Suning's high-level met Apple in the near future to prepare adequate sources.
The operator has made a deal with Suning, and it is foreseeable that, as the parties work in depth, they will certainly bring lower prices and more caring services to users.
"The lowest price, consumers may be "only $7 a day to buy iPhone7."
Adequate source and diversity of concessions to make the purchase of iPhone7 no longer "pressure mountains", and Suning's logistics will turn this beauty into a more visual experience.
Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suning, your iPhone7 is here."
The organizers wanted to make the local people more aware of the long-standing Chinese culture through the exhibition of cultural objects, thereby promoting mutual understanding and friendship among the peoples of the two countries.
Barcelona's Ming Dynasty Antiquities Fair is part of the European tour, which will last until early October.

According to foreign media reports, the Rio Olympic Green Pool has recently been paid to outside the news of the dive pool from blue.
However, in the morning of 10th, the water in the water pool adjacent to the diving pool became green.
The Australian waterball player said his eyes were stinging and crying.
Previously, the Rio Olympic official confirmed the greening of the pool and said that the water transformation of the pool was due to the weak base and did not affect the health of athletes.
But Australian athletes, after winning the Japanese team at the pool, said that the eyes were stinging.
The first time, after the jump pool greens, the host worked overtime on the night of 9th, but the colour of the pool was found to change rapidly in the morning of 10th.
During the Australian team and the Japanese team, the environmental conditions of the pool deteriorated, but the official stressed that they would restore the water quality of the two pools to the original color on 11th.
Mario Andrada, the spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games, said, "The level of alkalis in the diving pool first faded yesterday afternoon."
"We learned a series of reasons that could trigger the colour of the pool and the content of water quality ... "
The Water Sports Centre has conducted a series of tests of water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers use the pool to determine water quality to meet standards ... "
"We've been walking through normal procedures these days, but we may ignore the more likely athletes have an impact on water quality ... "
"But changes in water colours must have no impact on physical health, especially on athletes ... "
"This independent team confirmed our assessment and confirmed the measures taken to restore the pool to normal colour and normal chemical state ... "
"We wanted the pool to return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by rain. "
According to the Taiwan Central Society, an explosion in a prison on the outskirts of the Grand Manila area occurred yesterday night, which injured the warden and 10 prisoners died, reportedly including two Chinese.
ABS-CBN reported that the incident occurred in Paranaque prison around 9 p.m. last night, but the police did not make a preliminary statement until 2 a.m. today.
Police say the 10 prisoners asked the warden to complain about the transfer, but they were not speculation, and there were prisoners throwing grenades and made an explosion.

Urumqi regulates the business order travel agency in the tourist market.
Xinjiang has now entered the tourist season to regulate the order to regulate the tourist-dispersing market, the Urumqi City Tourism Enforcement Branch, the law enforcement branch of the Urumqi City Transport Authority, which did not regulate tourist vehicles in the bulk market, and travel agencies signed low contractual rates.
Yesterday at 8:00 a.m., about 10 tourist buses were parked around the Kebinski Hotel, most of which were a day-long tour to the Skypool.
"Hello, I'm from the Urumqi City Tourist Board. You signed a contract with this travel agency?"
The Urumqi City Transport Authority law enforcement branch staff, Yubin, introduced: "The alien tourist vehicle and bus operates tourist passenger transport projects in the Urumqi market, without qualifications. "
"The fine of three to 100,000 fines for over-range operations is a fine of $2,000 without a certificate of employment ... "
It is understood that the tourism law enforcement department in the city of Urumqi had previously examined places where tourists were concentrated in West Park, Red Mountain.
In combination of two inspections, Maggie, Deputy Chief of the Tourism Law Enforcement Branch of Urumqi City, said, "First, safe, second, no small travel vehicles, and once the problem is a group of injuries."
"We have a continuous market inspection with the pipeline to regulate the behaviour of travel agencies to ensure the safety of tourists ... "
On the morning of 12 August, the Press Office of the State Council held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
Press spokesman for the National Statistical Office, Director of the Division of Integrated Statistics for National Economic Statistics, said that in July, the growth of the national economy was slowing down, but still operating between reasonable zones.
Data published by the National Statistical Office show that the rate of growth in fixed assets investment in July, total imports, etc.
I'd like to use the words of the Prime Minister's words that the Prime Minister said, "Standing, still good," which would be better to summarize the characteristics of the July economic operation.
He explained that "in shape fluctuations" means that some economic indicators in July are indeed falling.
Because the domestic and foreign economy is still in deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and the recovery of the world economy is not as expected, the export pressure is still greater.
In the domestic situation, the economy is still at a critical stage of adjustment, and the pain of adjustment is being released and the economy is under pressure, so some indicators are volatile.
According to the event, there was a special situation in July, with severe floods, and that high-temperature and hot and hot weather had some impact on production operations in some regions.
According to the recent release of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people in the country have suffered, with direct economic losses of over $200 billion.
In terms of industry, investment, transport-related indicators, these areas are affected to different levels.
In July, cargo swings increased at a rate of 3.6 percentage points than last month, and floods have a certain impact on traffic in these areas.
From these factors, some of the indicators in July are also normal and expected.
He said, "Stand good" means that despite the decline in economic growth, the economy is generally stable, steady and steady.
In July, the CPI rose by 1.8 per cent, the ring ratio increased by 0.2 per cent; the CPI increased by 2.1 per cent in January-July, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to the Chongqing City Meteorological Service portal for high temperature weather in the districts, the rest of our city has received different degrees of high temperature allowance in the rest of our city.
There are currently at least 28 provinces in the country that have identified the rates for the issuance of allowances, but the criteria issued in the provinces and municipalities are not the same, while Chongqing receives high temperature benefits by high temperature working day allowance.
No less than 37 degrees C or more is issued at a standard of not less than $10 per person per person per day; more than 37 degrees C, which is issued at no less than $15 per person per day.
High-temperature staff above 40 degrees or more are entitled to a maximum of 20 yuan per day per month (except for workers who have received high temperature job allowance in accordance with the law).
According to this standard, the highest number of high weather days last month can receive 330 dollars, and the lowest number of days is $80, while the highest temperature of the sun is not high temperature, so there is no high temperature allowance.
Many units used to offset the high temperature allowance with cool drinks, and the City Security Service stated that this was not consistent with the current approach.
Without working hours due to high temperature weather, the use unit shall not be deducted or reduced by workers ' wages.
The Municipal Social Bureau stated that employees had not received high temperature benefits without receiving high temperature benefits through the labour dispute mediation agency where the enterprise was located or called 12333.
If useful units refuse to pay high temperature benefits, workers can complain to the human resources social security authorities above the county level.
And because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage, not benefits, to include the total wage, and the tax is reduced.
The high temperature allowance is therefore not within the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be replaced in kind such as beverages, etc.
The newly built Urumqi station is located in the high iron area of Urumqi City, with a entire building area of about 100,000 square metres.
The 1st floor is on the ground, the waiting room and the office, the commercial room, the 1st floor below the exit floor.
At present, the Urumqi station is the largest integrated transport hub in Xinjiang, with high iron, orbital traffic, public transport, rental, etc., which achieves seamless docking of various modes.
There are three ticket offices on both sides of the station and north of the exit floor, with 39 manual ticket windows and 34 vending machines.
In terms of tickets, there are 30 corridors on both sides of the waiting hall, and passengers can conduct quick checks, waiting for the ticket number.
If you need help, you can choose the 41 call buttons set in the near-string station, and you can get timely services.
From July 1, the old passenger station, the passenger train at Urumqinan Station, took a step to Urumqi station.
That means all the cars and 30-to-border trains can park at the Urumqi station.
Now both stations can buy tickets by car, and the train between them is about 10 minutes, and passengers need to be careful with the specific station names of the ticket and the terminal.
The official operation of the Urumqi New Passenger Station will be an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national integrated transport city, advancing the Silk Road Economic Belt and the construction of the new zone.
Gracia is a cute female-mouthed bird with a tropical rainforest.
In Costa Rica, Central American countries, the giant mouthbird Gracia and its stories are already known.
At the press conference on August 10th, Grecia, the post-operative recovery, showed people its brand-new 3D print plastic bird.
This year and a half ago, the dying giant mouth bird is finally reborn.
This day not only declared it 100% healthy, but also the day it moved into the luxury birdhouse and met with human friends who care about it.
The first-born Gracia was a little bit of a twilight, but it became lively, rolling in the water basin, eating grapes with new twilights.
To remind people of the harm it had suffered, technicians did not give it a new color, but kept the original white of 3D print materials.
The bird's twilight is a thin horny stale, which is empty, with only some fine bone support poles.
Although with this internal reinforcement, the giant mouthbirds are fragile and broken when they get hurt.
The Animal Rescue Center, bird scientists and an American 3D printing company, have worked together to produce several "tests" for Gracia, and finally made the perfect for it.
Now Gracia is skilled in drinking water, eating, even pecking small grain.
"The design of the final product took about two months, and it took four or five hours to print out. "
"3D printing is not a future technology, and it's actually walking into your life." Thomas Lange, Chairman of SG3D Printing, said in an interview with Xinhua International Reporter.
In January 2015, in a farm in Gracia, central Costa Rica, was discovered by a blood-blooded giant-mouthed bird, Gracia.
Its tops were brutally broken by a group of young people, and it was completely unable to eat and live in danger.
The tragedy of Gracia, after media reports, caused a wave of anti-treatment of animals in Costa Rica.
People are demanding the establishment of stricter animal protection laws to increase the punishment of abusers.
People come on and do their best to help Gracia recover as much as possible before they get hurt.
Even the 3D printing inventor Chuck Hale was involved in the design of Grecia's upper twilight.
"The situation in Gracia is special, and its upper part is less than 1 centimetres, so it brings many difficulties to install new thoriums ... "
"We scan Gracia first, then design, produce an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than the rest of it, fixed it with glue to its upper twilight. "
"This will reduce further intrusion damage to Gracia. "Range said to Xinhua international journalist ...
Before the prosthetics are installed, the staff clean up for Gracia every day in case of infection.
Far a thousand miles away, the story of the giant mouthbird Gracia touched the famous documentary director Paula Elredia and the exploration news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded the drops of the installation of the new twilight in Gracia, recording a documentary "The Kingdom of Big Mouth" that was played on the Animal Planet Channel this month.
The documentary "The Kingdom of Big Mouth" shows people how a small giant mouthbird can change a country and how to involve all nationals against animal abuse.
Core tip: Japanese oil companies are particularly vigilant about the rise of small independent refineries called "the teapot".
On August 12, the media reported that Japan's largest oil enterprise, JX energy, believes, "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the low-profile.
Japanese oil companies are particularly vigilant about the rise of small, independent refineries called "the teapot".
China's oil product quality is gradually approaching Japanese oil because of the Chinese government's enhanced environmental regulations.
Before obtaining permission to import crude oil, the Teapot Refinery usually imports high sulphur-containing heavy oil from Russia, etc.
Production of petroleum products with high levels of sulphur, poor oil, is one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining permission to import crude oil, the Teapot Refinery can import Omani crude oil and Russian crude oil with lower sulphur content, and the quality of its petroleum products has improved.
East Fire General Oil Company said, "As the quality standards of petroleum products in China continue to improve, the capacity of refining equipment has also increased.
As a result, China's export oil products are gradually reaching the same level as Japan."
JX Energy says, "After 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia", competing with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although Japan's high oil is in crisis, the Japanese oil company's response strategy is only "a focus on market conditions while exporting to profitable areas".
As China's exports have a huge impact on Asian market conditions, attention to teapot refineries is also increasing.

It's now autumn, but the Autumn Tiger seems to be a little less powerful than summer.
Ultraviolet not only makes the students' skin dark, but it's more tanned, how can the skin get through military training, not sunburn?
Sunscreen packagings are generally marked with SPF and PA, and SPF means sunproof index, which is for UVB ultraviolet, and our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50, etc.
The product marked PA is directed at UVA so that sunscreens play a more effective role, and normally the strength of PA is expressed in +, and one more + means an extension of effective protection.
Oil skin should choose more permeability water sunscreen, and sunscreen spray is a good option.
Dry skin should choose frost-like sunscreen; neutral skin is generally not strictly regulated, and any maintenance on sensitive skin is a burden, suggesting pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to put sunscreen half an hour in advance, because sunproof products take time to see the skin completely.
The military training days are long, and sunscreens can only be used every two hours to make a lasting effect, and don't be lazy.
The military training came back without the use of white products immediately because of the sun's sun.
After the military training sun, if you can use towels to wrap ice with ice, burn skin in ice to slow the local heat.
Farmers who purchase agricultural aircraft during the fair continue to implement a cumulative subsidy policy, and farmers can receive up to 40 per cent of subsidies for agricultural aircraft.
The fair is aimed at global solicitations, especially the invitation to countries along the "Away" and target market countries.
The fair tried to complete 60 solicitation projects, introduced $22 billion, signed more than 160 trade contracts, $3.2 billion.
According to the information received, the "Shangbo" has been in the middle of the industry for seven years in a row, because of the high base of the manufacturing industry in Ludee, Hunan Province.
As a host of the Expo, Ludee has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
The Expo became an important platform for local development of specialty industries and driving the specialty industry out of the country.
In some nights, the ionosphere was full of free electronics, which means that radio signals can go further.
According to the American Journal of Mass Sciences, August 11, the U.S. Air Force is interested in copying the effect.
Although the ionosphere with a stable amount of free electronics can help people listen to the radio station on the edge of a university radio station, this may not be the interest of the U.S. Air Force.
Electronic ionosphere means that the radios used by the military have a larger range of transmission and it may provide some protection for GPS signals from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellites based on demand that can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, these teams that contract with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
Industry data show that coal capacity was close to 6 billion tons in 2015 and 1.8 billion tons of coal capacity in the country.
In the last decade, the State Council has issued five notifications of over and backward capacity.
Although the first four times were not directed at the coal industry, the target industry had a direct relationship with the coal industry.
Last November and January this year, the price of 5,500 card-powered coal in Qin Emperor Island has long been wandering at a low level of $370/ton, and 90% of coal companies are in a loss.
Since February, coal prices have risen, and the price of coal in Qin Emperor has recently risen four weeks, rising to 16 months, climbing to $436 per ton, nearly $70 from the beginning of the year.
As prices rise, the world is concerned that a group of small coal mines will be re-emerged?
In response, the Director of the Institute for Reform and Development of China (Hinan) Institute for Reform and Development, Qian Xian Ming, has analysed and interpreted it.
Qian Hyun Ming: The ability to produce a high level of concern, and the report card for the coal industry published today does make you more worried.
The three surface factors reflect the reason for the relative lag in our way of growth in the past, which has not yet been fundamentally transformed.
Secondly, this is also directly related to the advancement of local governments, and in the process of de-production, funds and corresponding support measures are in place, and in this regard, there are really greater differences in different regions.
Third, if some provinces currently slower are going to catch up in the second half of the year, they may be at greater risk.
In such cases, the process of promoting decapacity by central awards may have some negative impact.
First, it's not simple to control the total amount.
Our aim is to re-establish the new business of the entire coal industry through the phase-out of backward capacity.
In the deployment of productive capacity, local governments must combine the transformation of the production capacity and the coal industry to develop the services.
Secondly, to complete this year ' s decapacity mission in this year, we need to fully implement the power of administrative oversight and administrative monitoring.
Finally, we're going to strengthen the bottom of social security.
Because the market directly involves employment problems, we need to strengthen training in employment skills for employees and employees.

Original title: Canadian police killed IS supporters: Home-made bomb attacks on market preparations
Taxi company said the taxi was transferred to Drif's house before the police arrived.
In a press conference on Wednesday, the police had received information that the FBI provided by the FBI about the martyr video that the young man was going to carry out the attack.
According to German voices, a man with a black Barakaf hat is reading the Koran, referring to crimes against Muslims and vows that it will soon attack a city in Canada.
He said in the video that the attack would occur within 72 hours and at peak time.
The incident was the first time that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power last year, the police killed a terrorist suspect before the incident.
The old Manfook River, which was upgraded, was upgraded, charged a toll from September 1st.
The two tributary routes have been adapted in a social financing approach, and the fees have been approved by relevant provincial government departments.
The old Van Fook River is running through the Golden Village, the fish table, entering the main course of the Kyoto Canal through Lake Nanyang, 32.5 km long.
According to the navigation needs, the old Van Fook channel has adopted a way of conservation and dedging the local depth, with local rushing straight, etc., and the conditions of access have improved.
The route is flowing through the Golden Village County, in the city of the city, entering the main channel of the Kyoto Hang Canal through Lake Namyang, 19 km long.
The renovation of the two routes began in February 2011 and completed the delivery and acceptance in January 2015, with investment construction and operation as the Anping Canal Logistics Service Centre, Jinning City.
In accordance with the principle of loan construction, fee repayment, the Anping Canal Logistics Service Centre in Jinning City collects the route tolls at the fee approved by the Shandong Price Authority.
Of these, basic tolls are collected at $1.75/load ton, and mileage tolls are charged at 0.05 yuan/km heavy tons.
Tolls are collected from 15 June 2016 to 14 June 2019.
Journalists learned from the Jinning Port Shipping Authority that there are currently four tolling lanes in Jinning, the Su Shui River, the White Horse Road, the North Rockway, the Old Van Fook River.
Four routes are the tributary lanes of the Kyoto Hang Canal, which are upgraded in a social financing manner.
The upgrade of the Su Shui River channel was the first project to use the "Government+market" model for infrastructure construction in the Inner River Port in Shandong Province, with the government accounting for the main investment and social funding gap.
The White Horse River, the Old Manford River, the North River, etc., is a purely market-based operation.
The funds allocated by the State do not meet the needs of construction and limit the progress of the upgrading of the course.
Social funding for public infrastructure is built in line with the requirements of national policies and is also a way to break the bottleneck of funds.
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100-metre free swim semi-finals has made many Chinese viewers silent.
But in the 50-metre free swim pre-game, Ningzawatao once again refreshed people's bottom line.
In fact, 50 meters of free swim is not the main item of Ningzawa, and his performance and his best performance at the Kazan World Championship, has also determined that he was unlikely to make a breakthrough in this project.
It was true that the Hong Kong authoritative media "Big Gazette" revealed that the biggest reason for Ningzawato's loss was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many of the factors outside the field may have had a significant impact on his future ideas, and he may now be more interested in entering the entertainment ring.
After the Kazan World Championship, Ningzawatao became a net red with its super-high and good grades.
So, the name "national husband," "Small Meat", "Face Man" and so on him.
Business activities are coming to the door, a good way of money, and it's a golden street.
In this case, Ningzawatao chose to retire at this time to join the entertainment circle, not only his freedom, but also a path that seemed feasible.
After all, he's 23 years old, and after a certain study, he can play one or two TV shows with his human spirit.
But Ningzawatao needs to see if he is qualified enough to compare to these predecessors?
The 2000 Sydney Olympics, Liu Xian, 21 years old, has come to the end of the athletes' career.
Liu's beautiful appearance made her remember quickly and laid the foundation for her future march into the entertainment community.
After he retired, Liu Xian played a number of TV shows and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tan-Lang participated in two Olympic single-person 10-metre competitions and won 2 gold and 2 silver.
But after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympic single-person competition, the competition went down and was blown out of the jumpers.
And he and his daughter are on "Where's Dad going" and he's making his eyes.
The golden generation of gymnastics, Yang Wei, Li Xiao Peng and Chen Yi-eok were high-profile in various arts programmes.
It's worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li Xiao Peng led China to win the 2008 Olympic Men's Championship, and Yang Wai won two personal gold medals, known as the Almighty King.
Chen Yi-eok, while leading China to the 2012 Olympic Group champion, became the ring king.
And after the miscalculation of gold medals at the London Olympics, Chen Yi's big move has made him so much powdered.
But the main energy of these athletes is still on the field, and for the show is just like a dragonflies -- and they're going.
But whether it's retired or active athletes, the favor of the entertainment community requires the results of the work.
After all, athletes are in a new field, both capable and human, a blank.
Even Tan Liang, Liu Xian, the old man in the entertainment community for years, the ordinary audience mentioned them, and more of them at the Olympics.
And Yang Wai, Li Xiao Peng and others, introduced at the show, are the Olympic champions, without exception.
The name of Ningzawatao's champion is a little thin compared to the above.
Besides, the negative impact of his image is probably immea at 23 years old, and the negative impact of his image is probably immeable than the work of Tan Liang, Liu Xian, Yang Wei and others.
After all, the demands of athletes are "no fighting, but not afraid of hardship," and Ningzawa is a lot worse than that.
Ten thousand steps to say that Ningzawa is handsome and can be supported by thousands of brain powders.
It's not hard to train for a response.
The path of life is based on personal will, but how to choose, Ningzawatao should count.
On the surface, cyber social platforms have expanded the circle and reduces people's loneliness.
The wider socialization of the Internet, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone contacts, but even infiltrated the real circle of life under the line, but also changing the social life of the people.
The benefits of online socialization are obvious, such as convenience and speed, so it's particularly vulnerable to young communities.
A survey of social habits for university students shows that 57% of university students use their mobile phones for more than five hours a day, and that the daily life is basically "no departure".
" Social networking has low-cost, fast transmission, multi-person communication, etc., in line with the needs of contemporary university students ... "
It's the main reason for expanding the human circle and dialogue more equitable and avoiding social concerns.
New people who just went into the company love to communicate online with colleagues, "Because they don't know much, and through social platforms, it's a lot closer than before."
"I've been talking to friends because of some mistakes and then a few words in a big group."
IT engineer Wu is a deep web social lover, and most of his social life happens online, with network contacts more than the number of friends underline.
Wu said he was more "like fish water" on the Internet.
"You can answer friends when they are convenient, because there are many time to consider words, and the expression can be clearer ... "
"You're hidden under ID and I avoid face-to-face collisions, not only with room for spin, but even giving each other more time and space to think about words and deeds. "
" People with different identities have the right and efficiency to speak equally, and social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace ... "
But Wu's friend Peng thinks that the Wu's words are a "very boring houseboy".
Peng and Wu met in a big group because they were both active speakers and soon met.
Peng thinks that Wu and the Internet are so boring, and they don't have to make a few words, "Oh, okay, yeah," or "I'm gonna check it online."
The mausoleum Water Police have now been involved in the investigation, and the mausoleum water transport department will also strengthen the treatment of illegal operations of vehicles.

On August 11, when the press phone interview returned to Huang Yilin, Sichuan's house, and she said, "It was too urgent, and I had only one thought of saving people!"
Wong Ilin is a student at the Central Nanlinco Grand Landscape Garden School in 2015.
I'm going to visit the local architectural design in Sichuan, who went to visit the design of the city and rural planning, and the family went to travel.
On August 8th, around 10:00 a.m., Huang's father was resting at the hotel, and the mother and daughter came out to go to the city of Mid-City.
I just walked far, and suddenly I saw a bunch of people screaming and walked up out of curiosity.
"The little boy is gone, the little girl is in the water, she only shows her little head on the river, sinking from time to time."
After the water, Yellow Elin, 165 centimeters tall, found out that it couldn't get on the end!
It looked calm before, but it was a current!
But she's still traveling to the little girl.
Wong Irin said the river was so greasy, anxious, less than 5 meters away, almost all her strength.
She's trying to push the little girl to the dyke, "The slope is so smooth, I'm afraid I'm not strong enough to sink."

Ms. Yoon's heart said that despite the danger, if she was in such a scene again, she would still support her daughter's choice and she was proud of her daughter!
Because it was forced, Wong Yilin rarely went in after learning to swim, "I didn't think it was really useful."

Northeast Tiger, currently listed as a endangered (EN) species of endangered species by the World Union for Nature Conservation (IUCN).
According to the Jilin Forestry Department, data jointly monitored by Central America and Russia in 1998 show that only 4 to 6 wild Northeast Tigers in Jilin province, 3 to 5 north-east leopards.

Sun Fook is a member of the party's cadre, lost his ideal belief, seriously violating party discipline, and the party's 18 years after the 18th year, he's not going to stop, he's in a bad nature, and it's serious.
After this case, after a number of media reports, it became a focus case, and social impact was extremely bad.
After the case, the police unit of the Haikou City Public Security Bureau was highly valued and immediately organized a team of responsible police officers to conduct an investigation.
The police immediately carried out the suspect to pursue the Internet, take a variety of measures to control and check the whereabouts of a country by contacting the field police.
Since the suspect is a common criminal, it has been repeatedly dealt with by public security organs, with a strong anti-detection capability, plus his long-term drug use, and often when questioning poisoning addiction is frequent, and the interrogation is very difficult.
Greenland sharks, also known as small-headed sleeping sharks, are widely distributed in Greenland and Iceland in the North Atlantic Sea, reaching 4 to 5 metres in adult age.
But they grow at a very slow pace, sometimes only about 1 centimetres in a year, which suggests that Greenland sharks may have a very long life.
Traditional year-metry methods usually use animal calciumized tissues, and some sharks can use fin ridges, but this calciumized tissue is rare in Greenland sharks.
New research led by Ulyus Nelson, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, was converted to use the eye crystals of Greenland sharks for radioactive carbon measurements.
This method was used to measure the age of whales, but it was used to determine the age of fish like sharks for the first time.
Their analysis shows that the largest shark life is estimated at 392 years, with a error of 120 years old.
That means that the shark is at least 272, the maximum possible age is 512.
In addition, the female Greenland shark is said to be about 4 meters long, and it's only to be old to be at least 156 years old.
Researchers therefore wrote in their paper that Greenland sharks are known on Earth, the longest-lived spine, exceeding the old long-lived champion's spinal whale (211).
Since a year, the results of the remittances have been significant, and the renminbi exchange rate has remained largely stable, while laying the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the renminbi.
In terms of market performance, the renminbi exchange rate has been marked in two-way floating features, and exchange rate elasticity has increased and the rate of exchange rate is expected to be generally stable.
So far, the renminbi has been volatile over 100 points of the middle price of the dollar, but the process has been depreciated.
The last transfer measure before the "8-11" was implemented in 2005, with a significant appreciation of the renminbi to the dollar in 10 years.
Since the new remittance was implemented, the renminbi changed its previous appreciation, and the middle price of the renminbi exchange rate was devalued about 8 per cent over a year.
On 1 October this year, the International Monetary Fund will formally accept the renminbi as the currency of SDR.
This week, statistics published by the General Customs Administration of China show that China ' s total import and export value 13.21 trillion yuan in the first seven months of the year, a 3 per cent decrease from the same period last year.
In the same month of July, China ' s total imports and exports fell by only 0.9 per cent over the same period, especially exports by 2.9 per cent over the same period.
Experts believe that despite the steady signs of export and export in July, there should be no high expectations.
In July, China ' s total import and export value of RMB 2.09 trillion, a decrease of 0.9 per cent over the same period.
Of these, exports of RMB 1.22 trillion, an increase of 2.9 per cent; imports of yuan 87.3 billion, a decrease of 5.7 per cent; trade surplus of $34.2.8 billion, an increase of 34 per cent.
Despite the decline in total imports and exports, export data has increased, and since March this year, exports have grown for the fifth consecutive month since March this year.
Shanghai police have captured more than 3,400 thieves in four months and hit 157 "smuggling" groups.
While investigating the case, the police also recovered the total amount of RMB 33 million.
According to the members of the theft group, they entered Shanghai from the field by packing black cars, then getting off the car separately, and they'll be in the car in a few hours and then leave.

Police remind the public that the public must lock up the doors and windows at the time of departure, and for the choice of windows, it is recommended that the citizens should choose harder steel.
According to China's Voice News Late Summit, Japanese Prime Minister Abe will attend the sixth African Development Conference in late August.
The African Development Conference was dominated by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, and therefore this meeting would also be the first to move to Africa.
In this regard, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan stated that local meetings in Africa helped to raise attention to Japan in Africa and European countries.
In conjunction with the visit of Abe, according to the Co-authority, Japan will send parliamentarians to the countries concerned.
Japan's "Input" path began in the early 1990s, while the African Development Conference, launched by Japan, also began in 1993, which is not a coincidence!
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations, a major United Nations ticket warehouse. How can Japan abandon Africa?
There will also be exchange of views with relevant persons from the extremist organization "Islamic State" and terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau.
Wen Hsiung, outside Japan, has recently explained its intentions on the African Development Conference at the United Nations Security Council.
Abe has announced that for the stability of sub-Saharan African countries, 100 billion yen (approximately $6.1 billion) will be provided in five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan ' s generosity to Africa has been for two main purposes: to increase Japan ' s sense of existence in Africa; and to gain support for African countries on entry issues.
According to the Japanese expert, Yang Bojiang, said, "In political terms, Africa, although relatively behind, the number of countries is more numerous, so Japan has always considered it the so-called "large-vote field".
Japan will not give up in the future, and the work of Africa will not end, and it will continue to strengthen.
Economically, because Japan has a strong productive capacity, but the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the context of the ageing of young children.
But from 10 years ago, Yuichiro, to Abe, 10 years later, Japan had launched several times, but all of them returned.
The Japanese expert, Yang Bojiang, believes that Japan's entry is always clear, but the path to normality must be difficult.
Japan is going to achieve its goals and first to engage with the surrounding countries, where Japan needs a right attitude, whether in geopolitical competition or in national disputes and historical awareness issues.

Traditional customs introduces the opening of the Hong Kong Park of the 2016 Zhuang Cultural Festival.
The music of the drums, the traditional little food, the fancy decorations, the crowd's scene.

A couple from France stayed at the scene for almost three hours and experienced it in the mini-drive mobile classroom.

The passion of the Mexican audience is impressed by the white lady, the young actor.
"I didn't think the Mexican audience was so passionate that I was worried about whether they could understand the story, but today they could catch the story and many laughs, which was unexpected. "
The Chinese Ambassador to Mexico, Qiu Xiaoqi, said that this year ' s Year of Cultural Exchanges has a positive role in promoting the people of China and Moe to promote friendship.

Since then, Tan Liang has been advertising and has been playing important roles like "Cowro", Thunderbolt in recent years.
A lot of NBA players have proven their strength, but someone's going to decline.
Whether it's age or time is limited, there are some players who are back in every season.
Of course, some of the retreats may be just data shrinking, and the players may not decline.
Even if Wade is still one of the best scorebacks in the Alliance, he's not gonna be as hot as the bull.
He and Rondo's back-field range are limited, and the three-point hit rate of the star Butler is only 32.8%, which makes them crowded next season.
In Wind City, the Flash will give Butler and Lundo more power to Butler and Lundo, and he's probably choosing to feed in the regular race.
Okaf's situation is embarrassing, and as the first choice for 76 last season, he had to compete with Simmons and Nbide in the new season.
This competition may not come soon, Simmons needs to adapt to the NBA field, and Nbide will be fully recovered from the injuries as soon as possible, but is still a problem with the position of the 76-person elders.
Last season, 32 per cent of Okafov scored from low-level attacks, which is higher than Cosins, Vuchevich and Brooke Lopez, and his usage rate is 40.
As Simmons has shown a great front-line potential, Embid has a better body for NBA, and Okaf is probably hard to be so stable.
Thompson's usage has been stable in the last two seasons, and these are the two best seasons of his career.
But the problem is, as Durant arrives, Thompson's usage will decline, which will affect his performance.
This impact will not only be the impact of the number of hits, but will certainly be significantly reduced next season, which will also reduce the difficulty of his defense in some ways.
Durant's arrival will shrink data from the Warriors, but the worst of them is Thompson.
But that doesn't mean that Tom God's level retreat, it's more like he's sacrificed the team as a whole.
Parker performed better last season than the data reflected, not only because his basket was the highest in his career, but his chemical reaction and Aldridge also benefited the sting team.
Duncan retired, Ginobilly announced another year of war, and the GDP combination ended up at the end, as the youngest of the three people, and not much oil in the French sports tank.
After getting the third champion ring, only Jabal, Jordan and Russell won more regular MVPs, and Jordan is the only FMVP than James.
Oh, yeah, James just brought Cleveland the first professional sports championship in the last 52 years.
James, who came to the 14th season of his career, needed better assurance of physical strength and prepare for the post-season race.
So, in the regular race, James' data is likely to decline further, and he'll share more burdens to Owen, but he'll still be the top three players in the league.
"You must start the talent learned from the country in Russia."
On 12th local time, Huang Jing, President of the Chinese Federation of Chinese in Moscow, said, when he saw the new Chinese journalist.

When you go back to Moscow, you must use the knowledge and skills you learn to contribute to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture.
At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Russian Chinese Cultural Promotion Association, also felt the same way.
She said she had made great progress with the help of the training teacher and felt the heavy burden of being a "Chinese culture overseas distributor".
Then Yon Wei said that he would continue to spread and promote Chinese traditional culture among Chinese and Russians who love Chinese culture.

The British team won silver in the seven-man football game, and Fiji won the gold medal.
In the seven-person football finals on Thursday night, the British team failed to continue in front of the Fiji team, defeated by Fiji at 43 to 7 at Riotiodoro Stadium.
The Fiji team won the gold medal with the impeccable performance of controlling the ball, breaking, avoiding, working, running and power, which is the first Olympic medal ever in the country.
Silver is a great comfort for the defeated British team, which is the third silver medal that the British delegation won that day. This is enough to make the British football team proud: they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on the first seven-person football game.
Earlier that day, the British team won the South African team at 7-5, which could affect their state in the finals.
But anyway, the Fiji team is enough to beat a 15-man team with a full spirit.
Tomorrow, at least one British will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort for the British team, but it may not.
It's not easy for the British team to achieve today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's teaching, they didn't taste the winnings at the International Seven-person football game in Adelaide.
And now they're only one step away from the champion.
They've been hit dramatically, but they've made amazing progress.
Fiji begins with the advantage, making the British team unsettled.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like hitting a series of buses that were driving, and when Osi Coliniso ran into the corner flag area, the World Series champion team was ahead of five to zero.
The game was only four minutes later, and Jerry Towey scored on the right wing.
Twelve to zero, the British team barely met the ball.
Mitchell's strong resistance has made the giant-like Leon Nacarava score for the third time, but it's just slowing down Fiji's score.
In seven minutes, Asa Velemaru was on the right corner. 17-0, the British team got worse.
That Calava gets another point, and the first half of the game is a minute.
Then Wattmo Lavovo broke the British team's defense and reached the scoreline.
The score is 29 to 0 on the middle break.
Fijians were born to play seven-man football, and the British team was still the first to go out.
That's what happened.
The British team made a huge change in the second half and hit the Fijian defense line in four minutes, which was doing well in the first half. But then the Fiji team had a great collaboration, and was scored again by Joshua Tuesova.
Dan Norton created the opportunity to score for the British team, and he changed the score to 36 to 7, but the game was already in control of South China Sea Island, and their fans sang loudly on the stand, waved flags and sing and danced.
Fiji's performance is a great show that has to be clapping.
Marta William stopped the Fiji team from an uncalled attack at the last moment.
The final whistle was ringing, the Fijians hugged together, and the defeated British team would have to regret the retreat.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated the Japanese team in the semi-finals, while Britain won the South African team in a fierce semi-final.
Kyle Brown helped the South African team lead, but Dan Norton scored in the second half of the game with a great foot.
Then the British team Anthony's brother Marcus Watson ensured the team's victory with a wonderful intercept, and eventually the British won the silver medal.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning were inspired by cancer-affected coaches and won the gold medal.
No exaggeration, it's the most moving gold medal.
From the beginning of the first oar, Helen Graf and Heather Stanning have received 220 punitive pull-up trainings, and the gold medal they won in Estacio da Lagoa is more extraordinary.
Although only two of them are rowing, there's one on board, Coach Robin Williams -- who has been with them to hit the second consecutive female double oar gold medal, the first group of women in England to reach this height.
They've kept 39 undefeated records, with absolute advantages.
What we see is that these two genius athletes marched on the water, but that's not all of this victory.
There are many voluntary help behind each boat gold medal, which is their constant dedication to create a difference, and none of them helped 30 months ago to learn that he's cancer and doesn't know if he's alive to see the day's coach.
As he said, death could come any minute.
I had bladder cancer, they had surgery for me.
If you don't do surgery, cancer cells will spread to the whole body.
So, it's gonna be much worse.
It'll change your mind a little.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment in early 2014 and minimized the impact, although in such cases it might not be appropriate.
I need to get my salary, so I have to get better.
It's an incentive for me.
I live in a hospital, and they say a few steps is enough, but I walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet.
That's the beginning of everything.
The boat movement itself is a journey, and it makes the journey a little longer.
At the moment they took the gold, they first thought about Williams, a little bit more talk about this morning, to overcome his anxiety.
Stanning, who was the leader of the Royal artillery team, she said, "I'm in a bad mood this week, probably a little extreme, but this gold medal is really very important."
It's been telling me how important it is to me, Helen and Robin.
It's Helen, Robin and I worked hard for three years.
Without Robin, we were just nobody. Thank you very much. He's the best coach in the world.
I can't find a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning haven't lost in five years.
The punishment for the combination is not comparable to their opponents.
Even at the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Graf still have a lot of physical reserves.
It was amazing.
Helen called, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It's important not to be influenced by the opponent.
We have a good start, and we're not looking forward to something amazing.
We didn't think about the glory of today, we just wanted to row every oar and win this game, and we did it.
It took a year to determine its future.
Graf's getting married to TV explorer Steve Buckshar next month.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the present.
I don't want to say this is my last game.
It'll put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It's a whole new experience, and I'm very nervous.
It's been about four minutes.
She said, "I feel better."

Snapchat's comic effect is ironic Asians.
Snapchat says the filter is inspired by animation, but some observers think it's ethnic.
150 million daily users of Snapchat can change reality through their filter tools and make people funny.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a role in Roy Lichtenstein.
These lenses have passivation, bending features, producing over 30 million modified self-censorships a day.
Any mistake will be noticed immediately by the public.
Snapchat lens was criticized, and the application was meant to be a black man or a beautiful white skin.
So when the application provides a filter to some users this week to create slash, weird teeth and pink face effects, some commentators call it racial irony to the Asian yellow.
They even think that these repeated problems mean that the company has a larger problem with diversity.
After Snapchat said it was deleted, the Verge and Motherboard report on Wednesday caused anger.
The company explains that the filter is a tribute to the role of the animation, not the sarcasm Asian.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the harmful stereotypes in reality.
Others are firmly opposed to these animations.
A Korean-American art student who tweeted and widely shared on these photos said in an e-mail that these filters were "at least painful and uncomfortable".
She also said, "It's hard to distinguish between the effects of extremely disgusting Asian ironic images and filters."
Although the filters are not just yellow, the yellow people are extremely devalued.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural bottom lines.
From the company board to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusiveness.
Snapchat's huge young group may be sensitive because it is more focused on ethnic diversity than the old generation.
When a filter of Snapchat created an insult to the user, 25-year-old Jucatti said in a Thursday interview, "It's harder to escape people than before."
Thursday, Ms. Chu, a product manager and engineer in Media, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article for Mediam and a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race dispute reflected Snapchat ' s lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Ms. Chu criticized most of the company's employees for white people, and the leadership was all male and added a label at the end of the article:
As a Chinese American, Ms. Chu said, "Or there are no colored people in their employees, so they can make such decisions, or some of their employees have colored people, but their positions cannot make them speak freely."
Other observers shared her complaints that she had not responded by Snapchat.
The company did not publish data on the diversity of employees and indicated that he was a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his staff, but a spokesman stated that the company recently hired a recruiter dedicated to focusing on low-scale internal populations and to promote internal inclusion.
Ms. Chu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users who oppose this act like us."
The congressional team said military officials distorted ISIS intelligence.
In a report issued on Thursday, a congressional group stated that officials of the United States Central Command changed the intelligence report and would describe the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as much more optimistic than the actual situation.
The midterm report comes from a special working group formed by the House Military Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the President of the Republicans of the Defence Sub-Commission of the House of Representatives. The report states that the Central Command intelligence analysts have "wide dissatisfaction", which indicated that their superiors were tampering with their assessment of the war between the United States and the Islamic State.
Central Command (Centcom) in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for regulating United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news report, "Intelligence reviewed by senior Central Command leaders is more optimistic about the description of United States counter-terrorism operations than the actual situation and has always been more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies. "
The Republican representative of California said, "The Central Command's behavior is unacceptable. On the other side, our fighters suffer from war, and the other is the wrong analysis by senior policymakers."
The central command leadership problem has extended to the highest level of the agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing the training of the Iraqi army in the United States.
Although there is no certainty evidence that high-ranking officials of the Obama administration ordered a change of these reports, according to the description of the report, the analysts felt that they were under pressure from the Central Command leaders and forced them to make more optimistic views on the threat of the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that "In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and parliamentary testimony are much more optimistic than the actual situation. "
For example, an official of the Central Command publicly stated that it might take a large military operation to take back Mosul as early as April or May 2015.
The second largest city in Iraq, Mosul, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
In a statement, the representative of the Kansas Republican Party, Mike Pompeyo, said: "This result has been evident after months of investigation. "
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the senior intelligence officials of the United States Central Command have manipulated the command's intelligence products and conceals the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq.
After the Republicans learned from analysts that information about the Islamic State was manipulated, a dedicated task force was established.
As the investigation continues, more will be found after the report released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of Defence has also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published its findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
In a statement, the representative of the Democratic Party of the Committee, stated that between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command developed an too narrow process for intelligence assessments of the Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeeping forces ... "
Mr. Sheanda said that the process "invented the release of intelligence", reduced the morale of analysts and "unacceptable to different opinions."
But Mr. Sheanda and Democrats also stated that they did not find any evidence that the White House tried to put pressure on the Central Command analysts, so their conclusions were in line with "pre-set or political narratives."
The Beast Daily reported the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that after receiving a complaint from the Central Command analyst, the Pentagon Attorney General began an investigation.
In a statement, Major Patrick Evans, the Pentagon spokesman, stated that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the congressional report before the Attorney General's investigation was not over.
But he said, "The experts sometimes divide the interpretation of complex data, while intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security themes ... "
The impact of the survey has exceeded the success of the United States-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria (a growing number of Defense officials claimed).
But last year, these ideas led the public to question the extent to which President Obama could trust the assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas issued by the Central Command.
Criticism about Islamic State intelligence reminds the controversy more than a decade ago, when Gregory Hook, the CIA intelligence analyst, wrote a study article stating that George Bush's government insisted on sending small-scale troops to Iraq, despite the opposition of many analysts, and had little consideration of the situation after the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook played a key role in this opposition to information in the Islamic State.
Last year, officials stated that Mr. Hook ' s team concluded that the air strikes against the Islamic State refinery did not significantly reduce the economic income of terrorist organizations, as the terrorist organization built a temporary refinery to sell oil on the black market, which was quite different from the statement published.
According to September, the Central Command did not publish this discovery.
When several lawyers reviewed Senate testimony on over-optimistic assessments of war, Central Command Commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April and is currently replaced by Joseph Waterr in Central Command.
America won four-time win in the women's hockey game, and it'll win with Britain.
Katie Bam, the only three dollars in the 6-1 game, took the lead for the American women hockey team on Thursday, helping the American team to win the Indian team at 3 to 0.
Five games were amazing, but 27-year-old Bam said she didn't know she had such a great performance.
She said, "I don't know anything about it."
I'm not the kind of guy who's gonna remember who's been in a few balls.
All she knows is that the American team has won four-fold victory at the Olympics and will fight the team for the British team after 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States meet in the last race on Saturday.
Both teams are promoted to a quarter final, and the game will decide who will appear as the first team.
The first team to get the team will avoid meeting a powerful Dutch team, so that it can go further.
In Saturday's game, the American team created a miracle with amazing performance, and you know, at the London Olympics four years ago, the American team was laid down in 12 teams.
Bam was in the team.
Bam grew up in Brewer, Pennsylvania, and first picked up hockey bats when she was three years old, and joined the national team at the age of 16 and became the youngest member of the national team to date.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to select the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not watched.
The next year, the British Craig Panham was the coach, and everything started to change.
Bam says, "This is a cultural, mental and substantive change."
We didn't reach our current level in London.
We've come to a complete turn.
Thursday night, Bam was in the first half of the game with a close reverse shot first.
India's not yet won in this game, but the team showed amazing tenacity and kept the score of 1 to zero until the end of section three, when Bam broke out.
She took the ball long way along the left side of the field, then cut it to the middle road, and the U.S. team 2 to zero.
Melissa Gonzales shot the last ball in mid-section IV.
The U.S. fights the first zero opponent in this game, and in the first three victories, each of the first three victories.
She's playing a lot this time.
So is Bam.
Panam says, "We're in good shape." But how good it depends on the results of the Saturday game.
The cold food of the Great Depression.
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was elected President, sat in the presidential office for lunch.
As a fooder, President Roosevelt likes the food on Fifth Avenue, like foie liver sauce and Maryland stew.
That day, his menu was very simple: ketchup devil eggs, mashed potatoes and as snacks.
Jane Zigman said, "This is for food to suffer with the people who are suffering."
Her husband Andrew Co. added, "This also reflects the way Americans eat."
These couples live in the Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Mr. Ko's last book, "The Scramble" is about American Chinese food, and Ms. Zigman tells the story of the life of poor tenants through food.
The new book they co-authored, "The Great Dinner", will be published by Harper Press on Tuesday, which presents the history of food in the Great Depression.
After showing some common views on food, they met a journalist at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a simple lunch counter in the ironing area since the economic collapse in 1929.
Ms. Zigman, 54, ordered a cream cheese with a broken olive sandwich, while Mr. 57-year-old Mr. C. ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable platters.
The press ordered a meat roll, which the couple thought they were suitable for the diet of the Great Depression.
Ms. Zigman said, "The bread was very popular."
There was peanut bread, liver bread, soybean bread.
They're all made of a raw material and a cheap water that can pour on raw materials.
Imagine your dinner is peanuts.
Mr. Ko is a weird face.
He said, "They must be like lead in your stomach."
In the years before the Great Depression, Americans were all buffets, especially in the suburbs.
A bunch of women cooks for men's farm workers, breakfast, lunch and dinner.
In World War I, it was the Americans who gave food to hungry Europeans.
Mr. Ko explained why he and his wife were writing this book: "When food became the main topic that upset Americans."
Another unpleasant topic is the new sour food: bread and stew became the main dish, and the stew is the best way to cook, and Ms. Zigman said, because cooks can use cream in sauce to cover up hard food.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dry fruit.
The meat that has been the leading American table for years has become a rare luxury.
Strange groceries only think about calories, compared to taste, even basic cooking common sense, and people first consider nutrition.
In studying books, including recipes, Ms. Zigman produced a roasted onions full of peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said, "It's not very common at dinner table."
Ms. Zigman said, "That's weird."
Peanut oil and roasted onions can't match.
It's a feature of many family economic meals.
Family economists influence the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as chefs of the Federal Family Economics Agency from 1923 to 1943, which is never the only one in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to "precision" and brave to turn bad food like cream pasta with carrots.
"The Great Food" is a rich "History Precious".
Especially the government's response to hungry people, such as the presidential citizen Herbert Hoover, "I can't handle."
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse in childhood, his diet was as fine as millionaires.
Mr. Ko said, "He likes European Western food, like fish with cucumber sauce."
He was wearing a tuxedo, eating in a gold-plated restaurant.
He's obviously out of the people.
If it wasn't for his wife Eleanor to set an example in his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book says, the housekeepers hired by Ms. Roosevelt are not interested in taste, so the White House's "food is not just the worst food in Washington, but also the worst food for cooking."
When America returns to formality, many of the Great Depression cooking methods were rejected.
Ms. Zigman said that we left behind our concerns about calories and nutrition and applied science to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote this book, they learned more about Ms. Zigman's mother's diet, like how she didn't abandon food.
Mr. Ko said, "She's very afraid of wasting food."
Ms. Zigman recalled, "She actually gave many people sick."
Like, there was a cream puff.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Koe took out a dessert they prepared at home: this is the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt at lunch.
Ms. Zigman said, "It's called cream fruit," and added a new tide for a normal dish called "the usual trick."
There's no cream in this dessert, only fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone barely turned it into a sticky brown paste.
Surprisingly, this dessert tastes good.
Mr. Koe ate the second spoon, third spoon.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert, and he told his wife, "A little bit of walnuts would be better."
Unfortunately, the latest monthly report of OPEC shows that crude oil production continues to increase in July, with Saudi production higher.
This report does not ban market doubts about OPEC's credibility, and the path to recovery in oil prices is still full of thorns.
On Monday, Sada, President of the OPEC Round and Minister of Energy of Qatar, stated that OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum of 26-28 September.
The monthly report published on Wednesday by OPEC shows that production of the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, increased by 46,000 barrels per day in July, to 331.1 million barrels/day.
OPEC also stated in the monthly newspaper that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oils, thereby increasing the extent of oversupply in the market.
As a result of this news, combined with the expected expectations of crude oil production in the United States and the unexpected increase in crude oil stocks, international oil prices fell in two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday, the price of light crude crude oil futures delivered by the New York Commodity Exchange fell by 2.48% in September, and the price of Brent crude oil futures delivered in October fell by 2.07 per cent.
Reuters believes that the proposed oil-producing conference is unlikely to tighten supply significantly, and the data published by the United States Energy Information Agency also presses market human gas.
On Wednesday, the Iranian official news agency Fars quoted the Iranian oil minister Zanga, stating that Iran ' s Japanese crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
The meeting just came out, Russian Minister of Energy Novak stated that there was no need for a new round of frozen production under oil prices.
The last oil-producing country meeting was in April, and OPEC member States failed to reach agreement on any measures.
BMIResearch Oil and Gas Analyst Emma Richards said that the market and the media might overreact the meeting that OPEC will be held.
Helima Croft, head of the Royal Bank of Canada, said that OPEC changed the mood of the market by releasing signals that they would contribute to the agreement.
This is like a smoke and mirror that distracts people.
Eugene Weinberg, head of major commodity research at the German Commercial Bank, claims that OPEC is considered to be less likely to stabilize the market through the September meeting.
It's likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all, the wolf came.
There are a focus on medical advertising, complaints and reports of complaints, both with multiple punished medical institutions.
The National Health Planning Commission, the National Central Medicine Authority, will monitor the conduct of specialized oversight inspections in some provinces in due course.
According to the media, due to the massive surge of capital into Internet medicine, the current problem of product homogeneity, investment surges and capital is entering the viewing period.
According to data from the management research centre of the Alibi Hospital in Hong Kong, Internet medical companies have died in a year, and about 20 per cent of the start-up Internet medical enterprises are no longer in existence.
However, while most Internet medical companies struggled on the A or B financing road, several leading enterprises in the sub-division area still get capital preferences.
It seems that Internet medical start-ups can't be "one bee" but to look at market demand, to be focused and deep.
Fish jumped to $1.20.00 million, or 40 per cent of the registered capital, and the Kyushu Company funded $1.80.00 million, or 60 per cent of the registered capital.
In recent years, with national policy support in medical information, electronicization, integrated supply chain management systems have gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
This fish leap and Kyushu are aimed at market demand, helping hospitals build advanced supply chain management systems and to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies, iBaby has been focusing on the vertical field of Internet obstetrics, deep-farming mothers and doctors.
Pregnant mothers can not only consult 24 hours free of charge and one-on-one doctors, but also for targeted medical consultations.

According to media reports, CEO Wang Qi recently said Ali's health is willing to sink down to take the big health data.
Internet companies, data companies lack professionalism, and no uniform writing methods on the same note.
Ali's current layout in health care is divided into three pieces, Ali's Health, Skycat Medicines and Paying the Future Hospital.
Wang Zheng said that health and health would be harder than any other industry, "It's not just a lot of money, but it's a lot of money, but to be patient and slowly."
It's easy to hurt the heart when you stay up and watch the Olympic Games.
The Brazilian Olympic Games are on fire, and even if the competition is broadcast in the country in the middle of the night, many citizens will stay up late.
The doctor specifically reminds us that there are health risks to stay up late and could cause cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up late, the hormone will still be in a lot of circulation, and the human body will continue to be nervous, unable to recover, easily cause an vascular contraction, a rise in blood pressure, thus causing cardiovascular disease.
Han Ji-won reminds groups of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, high blood sugar, high blood resin, smoking habits, family history, etc., can cause cardiovascular disease if they stay up overnight.
If you stay up late, not only is cardiovascular function affected, but also gastrointestinal functions, immune systems, neuroendocrine systems are affected, and even the risk of tumors increases.
For old friends, Han Chi-won suggested not to stay up late for the Olympic competition, especially those with cardiovascular disease history.
During the last World Cup football game, Han Chi-won visited a 60-year-old patient whose my myocardial infarction was triggered or related to the stay up night watching the game.
Han Chi-won has introduced that since this year, its science room has been diagnosed with some of the 25-year-old heart muscle infarction or brain strokes, which is largely caused by the long-term lifestyle of the patient.
1. Do not stay up overnight and watch their favorite sports projects occasionally, and other projects may wait for the next day to replay the event.
2. Stay up late to fill moisture, eat more fruit, prevent blood vessels and enhance the immune strength of the body.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, almost led to a nuclear war in the United States and the United States.
This incident was seen as the peak of the Cold War, known as the Cuban missile crisis.
But it is not known that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm had dangerously led the United States to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, which was not first published by researchers on August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused strong interference with radar and radio communications in the United States military in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the American ballistic missile early warning system for monitoring Soviet missiles.
This paper, completed by researchers at Colorado University, USA, interviewed American military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analysing solar activities and looked at non-secretary literature.
The paper wrote that in the 1960s, in order to prevent the sudden nuclear war between the Soviet Union, the United States Air Force had a portion of the warheads flying in the sky.
The US military commander did not know that the culprit of this interference was the sun storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the aircraft to prepare the war.
Fortunately, the solar activity of the United States military and its research on electromagnetic interference with the Earth since the late 1950s eventually prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the U.S. Air Weather Service and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of this solar storm is that the United States military has since seen space weather as a war concern and has established a stronger space weather forecast system.
In their daily travel, citizens found that the car was blocked by strange vehicles, using the "micro-car" function to solve this problem without contact with strange vehicle drivers.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly published a new edition of the US-Japan Defense Cooperation Pointer in New York, allowing Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role worldwide.
This is the day that U.S. Secretary of Defense Carter, United States Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shida Wen-hsiung and the Japanese Defense Minister, Nakaya Won attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth Chinese civil think tank published the Japanese military assessment report and the fourth English version.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including overall policy adjustments, military strength, defence budgets, military deployment, weapons equipment, institutional reform, military training, external military security cooperation, military security relations in China.
The report states that 2015 is the year of phase-of-the-stage acceptance of the Abe Government for several consecutive years in the security field.
Since then, Japan ' s initiatives in the field of security will be primarily at the operational dimensions of the rule of law, strategic implementation, policy implementation, rather than framework, mechanisms and policies.
The report emphasizes that the Abe Cabinet has tried to reach the "normalization of Japan" through three points, and that the Self-Defence Forces went out to intervene in international security matters, strengthen the Japanese-American alliance and the multi-purpose of China.

Complementing public sports facilities shortboards
The black coal farm warehouse became a football field of green grass like a "green grass"; the top of the red brick factory, turned into a modern sportshouse.
On the day of the people's fitness, Hangzhou, the South Camp Sports and Culture Park outside the River Gate, opened the mysterious veil.
This was a coal farm, and it was idle more than a decade ago, leaving a lot of illegal buildings and life trash.
After rehabilitation, it became a sports and cultural park and will be officially open to the public in November, providing free sports spaces to citizens, and undoubtedly opened a new fertile land for all sports.
It reminds us of the Chinese swimming grounds, and the Huang Po Military School of the Chinese swimming grounds has been swimming in many world champions.
The name of the swimming platform will continue to produce and vividly interpret the relationship between competitive sports and sport for all - a rich mass base that provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely linked to the basis of sport for all, and competitive sports depends in a sense on sport for all, while universal sports depends on the conditions of the site.
It was reported that as of 2015, our per capita stadium area, although 150 times as the establishment of New China, remained far behind sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020) to focus on the development of mass sports.
To fill this shortboard, on the one hand, the relevant departments need to take full account the layout of the stadium in conducting urban planning.
On the other hand, the stadiums in public stadiums, including schools, should maximize the scope of openness and to maximize the efficiency of use as much as possible.
The Rio Olympics, which are on the fire, have inspired people's enthusiasm and awakens the sense of participation.
Gilid got a lawyer's fee in a fight with the Mock's hepatitis C patent.
According to the judgement of the United States District Judge, Giled Science Corporation has the right to obtain counsel fees arising from hepatitis C patent litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merk Group.
In June, after American judges found that Merk had committed violations, including perjury and other immoral acts, Giled was exempt from paying $200 million in compensation for two patents of Gilid's best-selling drugs, Sofibwe and Havoni, who violated Merk's patents.
In the proceedings on Thursday, United States District Judge Beth Ramboson Freeman stated that Gilid was not required to bear the costs incurred by the defence.
Merk is trying to catch up with Giled Giled Giled's drug market for the new generation of hepatitis C drugs to cure more than 90% of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilid and Merk sued each other, both of whom claimed to be an active ingredient in the Gilid drug, the owner of Sofiabwe's lab.

Two men paid 20.3 per cent of federal taxes in 2015.
In a statement, Clinton's campaign assistant, Jennifer Palmieri, stated that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane would continue to become a financial and transparent pole ... "
In contrast, Donald Trump covered up for false reasons and recovered his previous commitment to publish tax returns.
Although the law does not require it, according to practice, the presidential candidate shall disclose their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyer used the U.S. IRS audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams tweets you were in charge and attached to the tax returns of the Democratic candidate.
Thursday, the Special Counsel of Trump, Michael Cohen, stated to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until the audit was completed.
The critics of Trump, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans said that Trump ' s refusal to publish tax returns would trigger questions about their net capital, charitable donations, commercial transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton grabbed the problem and released a video on Friday, highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to publish its tax.
Thursday, she asked this question in a Michigan economic policy speech.
She said to the people, "For decades, he refused to publish his tax returns like other presidential candidates."
According to Politician News Network, Trump paid little tax in two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, and they all said that the situation might remain.
Federal taxes have become a major problem in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named after a billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett, which states that people who earn more than $1 million a year pay at least 30 per cent of their taxes.
President Obama supports this proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Birkhel Hasaway, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffet says he's also under the IRS audit, and Trump's "feared" is not tax authorities, but voters.
The first tax returns published by the Clinton campaign team were 2007.
The average federal tax rate paid by the Clintons currently residing in Chabak, New York, was about 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate was about 40.5 per cent.
The Clintons tax returns in 2015 show that unlike most Americans, their salary income is only $100.
Their main investment is a low-cost index common fund, and the Clintons' share and interest income is $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticized the Berlin Hotel for deleting the Israeli phone code as required by Arab clients -- Reuters News.
A French filmmaker with Jewish origin revealed to the media that the Kebinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli telephone codes, and the hotel staff said it was based on the "request" of Arab clients, which triggered public opinion.
Claude Longzman, author of the Holocaust documentary "The Lottery", expressed his disappointment at the Kebinski Hotel and published an open letter in the German Frankfurt Report.
During his recent stay, Langzman wanted to find Israel on the list of telephone codes offered.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can speak directly from the room.
Israel disappeared in 2016 in Dublin in Germany?
Longzman wrote.
Instead, the guests can call Israel through the call center of the Kebinski Hotel.
To seek explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front desk.
In his letter, Longzman said that his answer at the front desk "he shocked him."
Hotel personnel say this is "the decision by the management of the Kebinski Hotel."
And the reason for doing this is to make the filmmaker angry.
Longzman quoted the original words of the employee: Most of our guests were Arabs, who asked for the deletion of the Israeli code ... "
According to the Nande Daily, the Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas Hamdelsman, called it "the shame of shame".
We're surprised to learn about this.
This is a great shame in itself.
And the hotel chain in Germany and that is a shame.
There's no need for any explanation.
"We hope the hotel will draw the right conclusion," the official said.
This incident has been a big deal online, and everyone thinks it's a scandal.
Some people think the Kebinski Hotel is "low down" to meet the demands of Arab clients.
Another post refers to the hotel "The Unfaceful" and pointed out that this street is near a synagogue on the famous Kudam Street.
According to the Mirror Weekly, the hotel quickly clarified all charges, claiming that everything was "unusual" and "apologies" to Longzman.
The Nande Daily quotes the representative of Kebinski: "No direct orders removed from the fast dial-up list."
The newspaper also indicated that the Israeli code was added to the list.
Brazilian students who expelled protests by police using tear gas and rubber bullets
On Thursday, in St. Paul, Brazil, students clashed with the police in protesting the reform of the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters.
The incident was due to the attempt by law enforcement officials to distract students, so the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the march and expressed their dissatisfaction with these programs.
In order to save money, the Governor of the State of St. Paul, Oakmin, plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be transferred.
Some of the students who participated in protests expressed their dissatisfaction with interim President Michel Temer through graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before the recent protest, protesters went to the streets to support President Dilma Rosev, impeached by the National Senate.
The Scottish biker, Kalm Skinner, won the bike gold medal and returned.
The Scottish biker Kalm Skinner last night at the Rio Bicycle Racer helped the British three to successfully defend the Olympic medal after the 2012 London Olympics.
The 23-year-old Glasgow biker replaced his Scottish fellow man, Sir Chris Hoy, became the center of the team. When young Skinner beats the winner of the New Zealand team and returned, even the legendary biker was proud of him.
Four years ago, the British team was amazing, and Hoy won the fifth of the six Olympic gold medals.
The British team was only sixth in the World Bicycle Championship in London in March, and Hoy retired since then, and then the British team was brilliant.
During the Beijing Olympics to the London Olympics, the problem of the British team was to change Jamie Stav.
That's what the convoy did when Cindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement also left a gap, and Gene Imadi and Matt Clampton both wanted to fill this gap.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's coaches insisted on getting him on the national team, and Skinner was not a big deal.
Skinner's partner was the Cindes and Kenny who won the gold medals with Hoy four years ago, and the three of them updated the Olympic record in the qualification, but this was surpassed by the New Zealand team in the first round.
And these three British bike races eventually beat the opponent and won the gold medal.
Although Cindes is a little behind, Kenny leads the team, and Skinner kept this lead to the end.
The change in strategy is the key to this reversal, and Cindes chose a larger wheel, so it's slow, which allows Kenny, especially Skinner to keep it fast.
Hoy watched the game as BBC commentator.
23-year-old Glasgow biker Skinner said, "It spoils me."
I'm just doing my best to make myself famous.
We created Olympic records in the finals and defeated the world champion.
This is incredible.
Nothing better than this victory.
After the 2012 London Olympics won the gold medal with Kenny and Hoy, Sindes admitted to fall on the track in a bad start.
Later, he withdrew the comment, and the British rivals were unable to appeal.
And this victory has no such problem.
Cinders says, "It's like London, and it's all British flags on the platform."
We just formed three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world champions, so it's amazing to be able to defend the Olympic champion.
This is just a game for the British team who won seven of the 10 gold medals at the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics.
If this symbolizes the progress we've made in the last five months, then we'll continue to succeed in the bike hall in the next five days.
According to Kenny's state, he's not likely to recreate Hoy's three gold medals at an Olympic Games.
If that's the case, Behoy was 12 years younger and also on March 23rd (which seems to be a sacred day in British sports, Steve Redgrave, Mo Fara and Roger Bannister) born on this day, Kenny will have six gold medals and one silver medal.
This is the same as Hoy.
Kenny's next battle will begin today for a three-day race.
The 28-year-old Bolton said, "I'll focus on this game for a while.
The team race is always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly, a man wins a little lonely.
Cinders said, "If he can win two other gold medals, he should be awarded the jazz seal."
It was the only game that day that won the medal, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wilkins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doyle promoted the four-km group chase with the fastest grades.
Their grades are 351.943.
The world record of the 2012 London Olympic gold medal winner is 351.659.
The first round and finals were held today's second game, and Wilkins will undoubtedly be the focus of the crowd.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the competition officer before the qualification, when the game officer made him measure his height.
In the women's group that will end tomorrow, Laura Trot, Joanna Russell Chandler, Eleanor Buck and Kate Archibald from Millga, promoted by a new world record 413.260.
The British team relies on its powerful field bike team to take the initiative in the middle of the Olympics and won multiple medals.
After showing its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British bicycle team was a little disappointed in his journey to Rio.
There were many discounts during the period, including the April technical director Sean Sutton resigned on gender discrimination and bullying charges and the retirement of legends like Hoy, Victoria Pendlton.
But the first night of the bike is enough to prove that the British team will be at its peak again.
After little life came to this world, Mom and Dad were responsible for this life, not only in the health of the child, but also in spiritual development, that is education.
If the child fails in education, even if the career succeeds, it doesn't make up for the lack of life, the failure of the family.
When a new life comes, the new parents need time to look after and educate their children and take responsibility.
And responsible, except for physical care, making them healthy and spiritual education, that is, how children learn how to be human, how adults can succeed.
Good family education means that parents need to be accompanied by their children, caring for children, patient care, and to teach children to develop civilized words and deeds, to better learn knowledge and improve intelligence.
Parents' words and deeds affect the growth of their children, and they imitate their parents, the dragons, the dragons, the phoenix, the sons of rats, and the parents are like children.
So parents need to be a good example in front of their children, regulate their words and deeds, and they can indirectly help children shape good hearts and make him better.

She's a very lively person, she's got a good time with her friends, and she's good at the environment.
But Amy had a little secret in her heart: she couldn't focus on her studies, work tasks for a long time.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time.
Even through decentralized, modular time, she can basically do her job and achieve good results.
But when the mission is heavy, the time is tight, Amy feels very painful and tortured.
Individual resistance to self-exportation and its emotional experience is aimed at not threatening individual self-awareness and self-esteem.
There are also behavioral psychologists who understand resistance as an individual's insubordination to its behaviour correction.
I tried to make Amy a practice to calm herself down by breathing and feeling the suffering.
And once she leaves that trapped situation, she felt relaxed and re-free.

The head of the Industrial Coordination Division of the National Development Reform Commission today stated that the excess capacity of steel is a global problem.
Our capacity utilization has been higher than the global average in recent years, and countries like the United States and Europe.
We have taken strong and effective measures to address excess capacity and are gradually emerging.
The head noted that the party's central State Department attached great importance to this global issue of excess capacity of steel.
Sectors, regions are actively implementing the deployment of the State Council and carefully, and this year it will reduce the capacity of approximately 45 million tons of crude steel.
From our national circumstances, we do not encourage steel exports, but rather a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The head stressed that international trade in steel products was essentially market behaviour and that it was derived from the demand of importing countries, and that consumers took into account the same factors such as product value.
The implementation of trade protection measures does not help to address the development of the global steel industry, but rather only further shocks to the international trade order.
When it comes to debt, the head stressed that debt resolution is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of addressing excess capacity.
Because of the size of the steel enterprise's assets and the wide-ranging, the complex debt relationship of some enterprises is complex, and if it is inappropriate, it may trigger regional risks.
According to the Director, in recent years, overall demand in society has gradually weakened, with reduced capacity utilization in some industries and increased production difficulties in enterprises.
Some enterprises do not adapt to market environmental changes, and production operations are difficult to continue or even on the verge of collapse, but are subject to institutional institutional factors, with more barriers to market exit, becoming zombie enterprises.
The existence of such enterprises has distorted market signals, reduces the efficiency of element resource utilization, increases social management costs and hinders the establishment of a fair competition market environment.
The main causes of losses are the same as the dilemma facing the global steel industry — market demand and low capacity utilization.
Our country has adopted mainly market mechanisms, economic means and rule of law, and the Government is primarily doing well-being and social stability to ensure a fair and fair market order.
The head stressed that the next step was to continue to catch up to produce capacity and ensure that the target mission of 100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel is completed.

Resakov, Captain of the Moscow City Tourism Police, said that the urban environment and tourism climate in Moscow has become more and more attractive to foreign tourists in recent years.
To adapt to tourism development needs, the tourism police force was established in July 2014 to patrol and protect, help and guide tourists at major sites.

Sarridge, a young European player, and many fans don't know him well, but through this Olympics, believe that Sarridge's performance has made a deep impression.

As the NBA's current labor agreement is about to enter the last year, as vice president of the NBA players' union, James will be at the forefront of the labour agreement negotiations.

The future of the Portland Smelter is full of uncertainty due to the cancellation of the power supply contract.
As a result of the disclosure of the plant owner of the plant, the owner of the plant will terminate a supply contract, and the Portland Aluminium Smelter in Victoria and hundreds of workers in the factory are currently facing an uncertain future.
This initiative took place after the Victorian government decided not to continue to issue subsidies to guarantee plant operations.
This 20-year fixed subsidy will be terminated in November.
2,000 workers at the Portland factory of the Aluminium Company may face unemployment.
Once the factory is closed, as many as 2,000 people may be unemployed directly or indirectly.
And because the plant uses about 10% of all power output in Victoria, it may also produce chain reactions.
In 2014, Aluminium closed the Hamley Point Smelting Plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesi power plant last year.
Aluminium Portland Smelter is currently losing and at risk of closure.
This was made after predicting the factory in the next few years, initially due to the strong Australian dollar, and recently because of the price of plant products.
AGL provides electricity to this large aluminium smelting plant through the old Eyan power plant in Latrob Valley. The company predicts that three other factory owners will also terminate its agreement.
The largest shareholder of the factory is a joint venture of aluminium and aluminium oxide, while China's Chinese Sin Group and Japan's Maru Red Club hold a small amount of shares.
The joint venture said, "AGL expects the Portland factory to continue to operate, which means that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand. "
AGL states that these contracts were supposed to have been in force since November 2016.
The termination period of the contract is 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
The power company said, "So, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate income in fiscal year 2017. "
Any possible income impact on AGL since the 2018 fiscal year is now subject to a optimistic outlook for wholesale electricity prices in futures markets.
AGL states that the company has reduced the contract value of $187 million in "expendation of activity".
Aluminium stated that the decision to terminate these contracts " would not affect the ability of the American aluminium company to operate the smelter or to ensure the power supply of the smelter".
The American company stated that it had signed a 20-year contract with Old Eyan in 2010, which would have entered into force in November this year, but the company did not explain why he withdrew.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland Smelter in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle is closed because of the bad economic situation in the industry.
In response to analysts ' comments earlier this week, the AGL Operator Stephen Michaelson said that Portland had an annual electricity consumption of about 600 MW and the Tomago factory reached about 900 MW.
If the two factories close, the demand for the electricity market will be significantly reduced.
He said, "As a power company, that's not good news for us."
Community law centres reject 160,000 people a year.
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are rejected by community law centres every year.
In Queensland, three out of five people were rejected in seeking free legal advice and agency services, mostly older persons, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who have no resources to combat unjust expulsion.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and is now facing further financial cuts.
Since June next year, the federal government will reduce the funding of these legal centres by another 30 per cent.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Centre, said that thousands of people were rejected every year according to the latest National Community Association Legal Centre.
Mr. Farrell said that if the federal government did not change the existing decisions, this would only get worse.
He said, "The community law centre in Queensland has long been underfunded, which means that thousands of people will not be able to access the important services needed. "
Those who need to stay away from violence, who carry unpaid huge debt, face falling apart families, squeezed workers, all facing legal problems, and the report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government will reduce its funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal problems without help.
We call on Attorney General and Queensland to withdraw the decisions of these funding cuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal issues.
Last year, the state government committed to raising legal aid funding to the national average.
Now we must focus on the needs of community law centres and their corresponding communities, and the White Loki government must also invest in this important work.

Britain must transmit the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport.
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our communities, London and the whole country.
For me, it's Heathrow's charm, just as at the 2012 London Olympics, we did everything we could to ensure that our countries and territories could benefit from these events.
The Olympics have benefited Stratford and the East Side.
And we will again benefit this area by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprentices, 40,000 new jobs and get young people around the airport out of unemployment.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, some people thought Heathrow's expansion was too large.
I was told Britain would not be ready for the Olympics and we'll be ashamed of the world.
The questioner's suspicion of the 2012 Olympics is wrong and their doubts about Heathrow's project will also prove wrong.
Although there are always obstacles to be overcome, Heathrow is addressing every problem facing.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most people, not a few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs, bringing economic growth of Pound21 billion, leaving a technology and employment wealth around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have a great Heathrow project team, which has been on time and has completed Pound11 billion in infrastructure investment projects within the budget, including the T5 terminal elected to the best airport terminal in the world for five consecutive years and the T2 terminal between the two busiest runways around the world.
Now, they're going to build a third runway with Pound16 billion in private investment.
Britain successfully organized the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe that Heathrow Airport Extension will also be a great success.
It's the time for us to pass the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport so that we can protect our future and create a technology and employment wealth that makes Britain proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Heathrow Airport Board and former Business Counsellor of the British Treasury Department.
A woman killed himself on the Swiss highway.
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to kill himself was run by multiple cars on the highway on Thursday morning.
The accident took place on the A1 highway near Morzh, Voju on Thursday morning.
War County Police said a woman was lying on the road in late night and was run by multiple cars.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman whose behavior was clearly committed with suicide.
This woman died on the spot.
Police have revealed that several drivers involved have been investigated, but some drivers are still not confirmed.
Counselor Giles Hofstadt said to the Geneva Tribune that criminal investigation has been initiated, a routine process for such events.
But it's not yet known if the driver will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
Hofstadt said, "This will be determined by the prosecutor."
Based on the results of two other similar cases in the last five years, the pilot will not be held accountable.
According to the newspaper, both cases were caused by someone walking on the highway at night, and the final verdict was that the pilot could not expect pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with negligence, charged with August 2014, and she hit a man on the A1 highway near Payena and killed him.
The court learned that the 22-year-old victim went through the road after drinking.
After the investigation, the judge said that the female police officer was driving was completely legal, and that the man appeared on the road "a completely unexpected and unpredictable situation" and that the female police officer called the first aid number after the incident.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near Thursday Day should call 021,644,83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus used to live in humans
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus used to live in humans.
Scientists at NASA Godad Space Institute have developed a model that can explore the past of Venus, which uses tools and algorithms that are very similar to that of climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus with high temperatures, waterless and atmospheres filled with carbon dioxide had an environment similar to the Earth.
Before, scientists thought Venus had a slower rate of rotation because it was thicker.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thiner atmosphere, similar to the Earth's atmosphere and that the rotation was equally slow.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than Earth, but there was enough water and geographical changes to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early, the sun on Venus was 30% darker than Earth.
At a press conference, Anthony del Janio, a scientist at the Godad Space Institute, explained: "In the model simulation of the Godad Space Institute, Venus slowly turned its side for almost two months. "
It warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds, thick clouds are like an umbrella to block most of the solar heat.
The result of the simulation is that Venus' average climate temperature is actually a few degrees lower than the Earth.
The model simulates the evolution of Venus is close to the speculation of former planetary scientists.
Although there may be life on Venus, in billions of years, Venus was exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet light.
The ocean evaporates on the planet, and water steam is burned out of ultraviolet light.
As hydrogen escapes, only thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and deadly greenhouse gas effects, thus creating Venus we know today.
Researchers published a simulation of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Newsletter.
Patrick Roy resigned as Commander of the Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey team on Thursday, and he said he had no say at the team's decision-making level.
Joe Sachs, Executive Vice President of Colorado, confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
In his statement, 50-year-old Roy said, "In the last three years, I have been active, passionate and determined to perform the duties of the coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche team. "
I've been thinking about how to improve this team all summer and make it a better level.
To that end, the coach and vice president's goals must be consistent with the club's goals.
He also needs to have a voice in decision-making affecting the team's performance.
But for now, these conditions are not met.
Sages hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sages said, "patrick told me his decision today."
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope he's going well in the future.
Roy was nominated as the best coach for the Jack Adams Prize League in the first season of 2013-14.
He helped the club get 112 points, first in the central division, but Colorado was eliminated by Minnesota in the first round of the post-season race, and lost their arms with the post-season race in the last two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the Avalanche team scored 39 to 39 to 4 and eventually lost the second foreign card in the Western Grand League.
As a doorkeeper of the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two each when working for the Montreal Canadians and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil field workers stopped strike and continued negotiations
The chief negotiator said that workers in the North Sea oil fields had stopped the strike on pay, and the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
There have been several strikes on the North Sea Oil Platform run by Royal Dutch Shells on Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute settlement process. "
We'll start earlier next week, and we'll have a full-day meeting in the coming weeks to re-examine these issues.
Trade unions have indicated that their recent action was to protest a maximum of 30 per cent of the salary reduction, which was the first action taken by the union in 25 years.
Wood Group reduced the pay of North Sea contractors by about 9% this year due to market pressure.
Before this salary reduction, the company reduced the remuneration of maritime contractors by 10 per cent in 2014.
The company said that another salary reduction would help the company get through the market depression.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because companies need to streamline their operations after the merger with the British Energy Corporation British Gas Group.
Energy companies are facing pressure from the decline in crude oil prices and the British Deutsche decision in June.
Dave Anderson, a member of the Scottish Parliament, met with union leaders earlier this week to explore the largest labour dispute in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea was vital to the regional economy.
In his statement, Dave said, "In the North Sea and the whole country, we need an economy that serves most people rather than a few."
In 2016, expenditures for the new North Sea project are expected not exceeding $1.4 billion, compared to an average project expenditure of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of the star of the Star of the Star.
The latest mission of this Kepler space telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete star rotation speed.
New data is helping astronomers understand why the star of the group has different rotation speeds and the connection between the rotation cycle and the planet.
At a press conference at the Infrared Processing Analysis Centre at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, said: "We want to learn more about the relationship between star quality, age, even its solar system history by comparing our results and other constellations. "
The Cebu group is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the constellation were born about 125 million years ago and are just adult.
They've reached the highest rate of rotation in their lives.
When they reach the maximum rotation speed, these mature stars shoot a lot of star wind.
When these stars go through the magnetic field of stars, they produce action for stars.
As the age of stars increases, the rate of rotation starts to slow down.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of stars by tracking identified blacks (like sun blacks).
The latest rotation speed data set shows that the rotation of stars with larger quality is slower than a smaller star.
Rebul compared stars to dancers, larger dancers rotate faster than smaller dancers.
Rebul says, "In the "Balature Show" of the Star of the Order, we find that slow-turned stars are often of larger quality, while the fastest-turned stars are often the lightest star."
Because of the close distance of the Star, it can be the ideal space lab to compare the mass and rotation speed of stars.
Rebul says, "The Aung Star has laid the foundation for the theory of two-way rotation of young and old stars."
We still have a lot of knowledge about how stars, when and why they slow down and "take their own dance shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues described their latest analysis of the speed of the Aung Cebu Group in three new papers, which will soon be published in Astronomy Journal.
Zheng Jianjun, Chief of Water Management Section of South Lake Park, described that the bottom of South Lake is more than 10 metres deep and is likely to be dangerous for those who do not understand the circumstances.
"Although the South Lake Rescue Team is very professional, it is still hoped that the tourists who rowed will wear life jackets, not to do violations on the lake and play safely. "
The siege village has a unique marine environment, with two major leisure tourism resources for natural ecology and humanities.
"But the individual owner who bought the small area space was afraid that it would affect the rental price of their spaces and suspected that others had a personal heart, so they had been destroyed behind their backs, leading to the renovation of the parking space being held ... "
The academic community still has a lot of story about when the potatoes are introduced by someone.
In the current more mainstream view, the introduction of potatoes is mainly three lines.
The three lines introduced by potatoes are the most influential and most widely transmitted, Chen Jinlong was introduced by the Philippines to Fukuo.
The Beijing City Social Group Management Office will conduct a special inspection of the use of uniform receipts of social groups.
The inspection is divided into two units and focus.
Presentation by the relevant heads of the Municipal Association, which includes social groups receiving uniform receipts for social groups in the city community from 2013 to 2015.
The Rio Commission said in the Olympic Communication Strategy developed in 20"2: "Is the success of the Olympic Games defined by people who share stories in social media."
And from the reports of the Olympic Games, media have changed considerably in many ways of spreading, product patterns, language style, news perspectives, etc.
IOC and media practitioners from all over the world seem to have met this round of challenges.
On August 11, the Gwang-Gwang Securities H stock was publicly sold on the last day. There was news that the market response was flat on the two days before the stock recruitment.
According to a domestic voucher analyst, Eastern securities are not good at the port, and the director of the East Bank is the director of the East Certificate.
Experts note that many vouchers have declined since this year, many vouchers have declined, but that the company's own business will be more visible after the company's own business.
After this new government, Suzhou will be the first second-line city in the country to restart the limited purchase.
The second-line cities that are going out or are about to be set out in the city of Suzhou, but also cities like Fatty, Nanjing.
Previously, Fatty had been the first to issue a loan-limited policy, and for two suites under the Fatty, the bank would refuse to provide mortgage services for two suites and an unliquidated housing loan.
