According to the British media, Admiral William Moran, Deputy Secretary of Operations of the United States Navy, said that even if the United States Navy was re-emerging forces to respond to increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the United States continued to expand the area of the region to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific -- as the focus of the Navy.
According to the British Jane Defense Weekly website, September 24th, the United States listed China and Russia as a strategic rival in the new defence strategy released early.
Since then, the U.S. Navy has recovered its second fleet to fight Russia more directly.
According to reports, these moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts, and they fear that the U.S. Navy may stay away from the Obama administration's Asia-Pacific Rebalancing strategy.
But Admiral Moran said that the focus of the U.S. Navy remains in the Western Pacific.
On January 24, 2018, at a round table seminar organized by the National Asian Research Agency in Washington, D.C., he said, "There has been no significant change for us."
Moran said: " The focus remains a rebalanced, the focus shift or whatever you want to describe it ... "
But he admits that the United States is close to Europe.
He said, " We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do ... "
Although Moran points out that the overall policy on Russia falls within the terms of reference of the United States Defense Minister, he warned that " Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, history has proven that if we conflict with them, they will be very strong ... "
Admiral Moran said that as part of the re-starting operation of the United States against Russia, China and other competitors, the United States Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a "new mode of combat " , which will help to keep the opponent in the United States carrier or other assets to be deployed at any given time and location.
He said, "We and the Marines support it - the concept of unpredictability of combat, not again and over again, almost like a hair -- that's what we do."
Reports say that the first new practice to try this new approach was the Harry Truman carrier combat group, which included early deployments of the battle group, including work visits to ports and patrol them in areas that are usually only adopted.
Moran said that the U.S. Navy is currently working to ensure that allies know that these ships will still patrol in traditional areas and are still addressing logistics and family liaison issues for new deployment procedures.
Lieutenant General Michael Nunan, Commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also spoke at the event stating that the Australian army could work seamlessly with the American carrier.
He said that as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more frigates with Zeus Shields, this situation will continue.

Japan's commercial investment in China's investment in China's investment in China's Chinese shares has been reduced by a reduction in its largest business investment transaction due to Chinese and American trade tensions.
In May 2016, a man walked through the headquarters of the Maru Red Society in Tokyo, Japan.
Maru-hong says that the US grain sector, under the flag of the trade war, has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Former Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies, etc., warned about the impact of trade frictions in China and the United States, and now these Japanese traders have joined the list.
The US and China impose tariffs hundreds of billions of dollars of goods to each other, and President Trump threatened that if the dispute could not be resolved, to extend the tax range to over $50 billion in Chinese goods.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, President of Commercial Finance, Ito, said that next year the trade dispute could have a greater impact on the Chinese economy.
Ito's commercial and Thai Bee Group invested $10 billion in 2015 and received 20 per cent of its equity.
Hachimura claims that Ito's commercial share of this part of the loss of 1,43.3 billion (US$ 1.3 billion) is due to the fact that the price of the Chinese letter will not rise in the near future.
Ito's commercial firm maintains a profit forecast for the fiscal year ending 31 March 2019 at 50 billion yen.
China imposed 25 per cent of the import duties on soybeans in the United States in July to counter Washington's initiatives in trade friction.
"Our grain operations have been hit by trade frictions in the United States, " Yonhong Finance, Yanhong, said.
He said that Gao-hung has stopped financial transactions in its own account since September.

The Chinese New Net, November 5, a comprehensive report that the mid-term election vote in the United States has entered a countdown.
On November 4, President Trump and Democratic rivals actively "take" to their core voters.
Both parties have pointed out that voter turnout would be the key to the right and left.
It was reported that 48 hours before the American people voted, Trump was busy attending the Republican candidate's momentum, and former President Obama went to Indiana to stand on the stage for the urgent Democratic Federal Senate candidate Joe Donnelly and called the people for the final pre-election.
On 4 November, Trump went to the Republican Governor's candidate Brian Kemp, Georgia, and said, " You must go to the polling station on Tuesday, you must vote. "
"The comparison of this election cannot be clearer ... "
Voters' political enthusiasm has risen to a rare peak, and some states have voted far more than usual.
The President of the United States faces the first mid-election, and the seats of the political party are often reduced.
According to the new poll published by the Washington Post and the American Broadcasting Corporation News on 4th, while the Democratic Federal House of Representatives still maintains its advantage, Republicans can benefit from economic assessments and strict concerns about the border security by Trump.
The polls show that registered voters like Democratic House candidates more than Republicans, 50 per cent to 43%, but still down compared to 14 percentage points in August.
Another poll made by NBC and Wall Street Journal also shows that Democrats still lead seven percentage points for Republicans.
According to the information received, Obama said to the crowd in Senator Donnelly's momentum: " When people don't tell the truth, words no longer represent anything, it's bound to be evil.
When people lie to themselves, democracy doesn't work. "
"The only way to stop these Republicans now is you and your ballot. "
The Democrats face the most difficult choice in decades in the Senate, and the Republicans now have half of the 51 seats.
But the House of Representatives is more favourable, and the Democrats need to win another 23 seats to control the House of Representatives with 435 seats.
Analysts of the selection website FiveThirtyEight.com predict that the Democrats are expected to win the House of Representatives by 85%.

On November 5, the People's Network, Beijing, under the current wave of popular entrepreneurship, innovation, more and more technology companies have begun to focus on patent research and development and related protection efforts, dig up the potential value of patents and occupy market ownership.
Similarly, a number of technology companies have experienced a lot of violations in patent technology authorization, the use of patent technology, etc.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, Ho Zhanghong, the three people from Guangdong Province, based on patent infringement, Beijing Orange Technology Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Orange Technology), operator Drip Travel Technology Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as drop drops), the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Ltd.

The plaintiff believes that the patent and inventor of the patent patent "based on mobile terminal carpool service systems and methods", while the entire operation of the "drilling" application in the APP corresponds to the technical programme for patent protection, which constitutes patent infringement.
However, during the Court ' s ruling, Orange Technology held that the Guangdong Pacific Ocean was not a suitable defendant, which provided free download of the APP "drilling" on the Internet, without a direct or indirect violation, and should not be listed as accused in the case.
Second, the violation in this case is not in Guangdong.

Other proceedings in the case are not yet published, and journalists will also follow the follow-up details of the drop-down patent infringement.
Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research of Australia: the results of scientific and technological cooperation in Australia have been significant
" China ' s science and technology have grown rapidly over the past few decades, and Australia has worked together in the scientific field to achieve great results ... "
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization, in Beijing, said that cooperation in Australia in the field of science and technology has shown a living opportunity in cooperation in the field of science and technology.
As the largest national research institute in the Federation of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research findings in the areas of oceans, energy, biology, materials, astronomicals.
CSIRO has been working closely with scientific institutions like the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendship that contains a tradition of trust in partners and long-term cooperation ... " Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-metre-calibre surface radio telescope - " China Skyeye " installed the first international 19 beam L-band receiver.
This is the most advanced 19 beam feed receiver in the world, developed jointly by Chinese Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver was based on the technological accumulation of CSIRO over the years, and that the FAST cruise speed would increase five to sixfold, while expanding more scientific observations.
"This is a force of CSIRO's contribution to FAST."
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO is working closely with Chinese scientific institutions in building square kilometres of array telescopes, developing new fuel technologies, energy-efficient emission reductions, etc.
" Previous scientific research is often focused on problems after centuries, and more scientific forces are needed to solve the problems that are before ... "
Marshall believes that Australia is complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a range of challenges in development.
For example, extreme weather has emerged globally, drought and floods have led to food reduction, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosions, ageing, chronic diseases, etc. are also serious challenges.
" Australian cooperation in recent years is the main focus on addressing these current challenges ... "
Marshall introduced the International Southern Hemispheric Marine Research Centre, established with the National Laboratory for Marine Sciences and Technology of Qingdao, focusing on observing El Nio and La Nina phenomena, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather and the establishment of early weather facilities; the new grain varieties developed by CSI and the Central College, which could also mitigate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, science and technology innovation is difficult to complete alone, requires very high costs and a lot of problems to be addressed, so cooperation is particularly important today ... "
Marshall says that the closer cooperation is likely to make breakthroughs, which is also the meaning of strengthening cooperation among the Australians under the framework of the "a whole way".
" Strengthening bilateral cooperation, mainly scientific and technological cooperation for us ... "
Marshall, for example, has developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, which is very environmentally harmful because of the traditional cyanide gold purity method, and many countries want to find a way to pure gold with small environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to bring this technology into China, one of the results we've been involved in the "Away" partnership. "

North Korean Foreign Affairs Li Yong Ho said to the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions continued to deepen North Korea’s lack of trust in the United States and that North Korea could not abandon nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Li Yong Ho, at the United Nations General Assembly, stated that North Korea had adopted a "very friendly approach " over the past year, including the cessation of missiles and nuclear tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and committed to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"But we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said...
"If you don't trust the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such cases we cannot give up weapons on a unilateral basis ... "
Although Lee Yong Ho repeated North Korea's complaint against "phased" denuclearization, his speech was of great significance, because it was not completely rejected to nuclearization as North Korea used to.
Lee Yong Ho mentioned the joint statement of Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed to work towards the Korean peninsula, and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States claims that North Korea must abandon nuclear weapons first.
The United States also refused to relax the demands of international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclearization first" and increased the pressure on sanctions, achieving its purpose in a high pressure, and even refused to publish a "war end declaration " , "Li Yong Ho.
"The idea that sanctions will make us kneel and beg for forgiveness are not aware of our people having a daydream.
But the problem is that this continuing sanctions are deepening our mistrust ... "
Lee Yong Ho didn't mention the second TTM plan mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he stressed that Kim Jong-un and Korean President Wen had met three times in the last five months and said: " If the other party to nuclearization is Korea, the Korean peninsula will not become so rigid ... "
China announced that, as of 1 November 2018, the import tariff for 1585 tax purposes had been reduced.

At the same time, there has been a significant reduction in the production of anti-cancer drugs and the value added tax on imports.
On 1 July, taxes on 218 taxes on cars and parts for 218 tax purposes.
After tax cuts, China's car-wide tax rate is below the average of developing countries, consistent with the actual Chinese automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive industry structural adjustment and resource optimization, accelerate the success and disadvantages, help improve the quality of products and services and are expected to promote car price adjustment to a certain extent and to make consumers more affordable.
On July 1st, taxed consumer goods for 1449 tax purposes.
The daily consumer tax cuts are closely linked to the good lives of the people.
The tax cuts are not only large but also strong, but the average tax reduction is 56%.
Tax cuts for daily consumer goods directly benefit a wide range of consumers and promote competitiveness in domestic industries.
On 1 November, the tax will be imposed on 1585 tax-purpose electrical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials.
The proper reduction of import tariffs on industrial goods that are urgently needed in part of the country can attract more foreign investment, facilitate increased domestic supply and support industry upgrading, while helping enterprises to allocate resources globally, reduce production costs and contribute to reducing domestic environmental pressure.
The relevant heads of the Customs and Tax Commission of the China State Council introduced the four self-deductions of taxes and the third step down tax reduction in the results of the negotiations under the expansion of the information technology agreement on 1 July this year will reduce China ' s total tariff level from 9.8 per cent to 7.5 per cent in the previous year.
The adjusted total level of tariffs is slightly higher than the EU, below most developing countries, at a medium low level, largely matching the status and development phase of China ' s developing countries.
The head described that the overall level of customs duties as one of the important indicators of openness in the field of goods trade in China should be adapted to the economic development phase of China, reflecting the characteristics of the times.
China ' s trade in goods is the global scale, with a further expansion of open economic base, but there is still a gap between the quality and benefits of trade development compared to developed economies and therefore should be properly reduced.
Customs duties are a protection tool for compliance, and tariff levels should be adapted to industrial competitiveness, encouraging benign competition, overprotecting industry development and quality improvement.
The adjustment of tariff rates is to balance production needs and consumption needs.
Focus on reducing the high domestic demand and the commodity tax rates that contribute to the upgrading of industrial transformation, efforts to increase the import of products with a more concentrated demand for the population, increasing corporate and public access to the needs of industrial structures and consumer structures.
Tax cuts take into account the acceptable capacity of fiscal income and industrial development.
The choice of specific tax-deduction goods and tax reduction ranges should be coordinated in two markets, both domestic and foreign, both upstream, production and consumption, and maintaining the steady and positive developments in China.
The head stressed that this year was the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening, and China ' s initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major initiative based on China ' s own high-quality development needs to achieve high-quality development needs, which contribute to the integrated use of both international resources abroad to promote the quality of domestic supply systems and meet the needs of the population ' s consumption upgrading.
This action and initiative shows that China will be firmly committed to mutually beneficial and win-win open strategies, firmly supporting economic globalization, firmly upholding the principles of free trade and the WTO-centred multilateral trading system, continue to draw the momentum for development from openness to the world and to make China ' s development better for the world.

According to the Russian Tass, on 29 September, Vuchchi stated that he had informed the current situation with all parties such as the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and Europe, to meet with Russian President Putin on 2 October to meet with Russian President Putin, to seek Putin's support on Kosovo.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vuchchi answered: " I do not want a major military conflict on our territory ... "
Vuchchi also stated that the Serbs were entering a full-scale state of war just to form a deterrent to prevent the occurrence of conflict, but it was also a clear warning: there would never tolerate any violence in Kosovo.
The Serbian army is about two major developments in Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, Albanians have recently arrested Serbs who lived in the northern part of Kosovo, who did not break any laws.
Vuchchi states that, on 26 March this year, Marko Yuridge, head of the Office of Kosovo and Metoshiia of the Serbian Government, was beaten and detained by Kosovo Albanian forces, and that the Albanians had been brutally arrested and expelled.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, armed police and snipers, occupied positions near the lake of the Gazivoda hydroelectric plant, entering the ecological and sports centres near the northern dam in the Kosovo region and blocked all the roads nearby, which were controlled by the Serbian side.
Vuchchi noted that this military adventure in Kosovo, which was encouraged by Western countries, did not inform Serbia in advance, in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, and also in violation of the military technical agreement between UN Security Council resolution 1244 and Sesco.
Vuchchi has spoken to NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg for criticizing Western countries on Kosovo.
The root causes of this conflict are still centuries of historical grievances between the Serb communities in the Kosovo region.
With regard to Kosovo's belonging, Serbs and Albanians have different statements.
Serbia sees Kosovo as a national cradle, because Serbia built its most powerful country here in the 12th century, while the Albanians moved significantly after the Ottoman Empire invasion and the Serbs lost the north.
The Albanians insist that the original tribe of Kosovo in Kosovo in the 4-5th century B.C. was the ancestors of the Albanians, and therefore Kosovo has been the territory of the Albanians since ancient times.
The subjective political division has led to intense conflicts between peoples, religions and cultures, resulting in intense confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared Albania ' s independence.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, with Serbs relatively rising, and in the Serbs' view, "only to take back their own land", was seen by the Albanians as the looting of the Great Serbianism, and the two were contradictory.
Kosovo became a " gunpowder drum " in the Balkans.
In 1999, armed conflict between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the South Union of Serbia and Montenegro and the outbreak of the war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Although there have been some news that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and to sign a global and legally binding agreement, agreements that are subject to multi-powered forces such as the United States and Russia have not been able to sign because of historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
And just a month ago, Vuchchi made it clear for the first time that the Serbs in Kosovo were isolated from the Albanians and to make the conflict again publicize the two ethnic conflicts.

The real-time concentration of PM2.5 was more frequent in September.
A major factor in the emergence of the Blue Sky is generally favourable in weather conditions in recent times, and more importantly, Beijing has been conducting constant atmospheric pollution management, and has been pushing forward the clean air action plan for the last five years, and the continued release of environmental benefits has reduced total emissions in the region, which laid the foundation for the continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially released and implemented the Beijing City Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017.

The National Medical Centre for Children ' s Medicine, Shanghai, Shanghai, 30 September, was disclosed at the University of Jordan on 30th day, and it introduced the Canadian advanced approach in the leading project for the pre-natal quality improvement project for pre-natal births in China.
Project results show that, after active treatment, the survival rate of premature births in 29 weeks and above in China has reached developed countries, but there is still room for improvement in survival of premature and premature births.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese government has been concerned about the treatment of newborns.
At present, infant mortality rates in Shanghai have fallen to 3.71 gills, significantly below the national average, reaching advanced levels in developed countries.
The Project for Early Childhood Improvement for Early Births in China has significantly improved the quality of premature births through four years of tireless efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Nursery Hospital (NICU) of the University of Jordan, stated to journalists that, while improving the survival of premature children, while improving the survival of premature children, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the overall outcome of the child, and important importance to improving the overall survival of premature children and the quality of the population, and is also a key issue of concern in the project.
The China Project for Early Childhood Improvement for Early Births, which, through four years of tireless efforts, recorded tens of thousands of premature births in the country for 33 weeks and below, reducing the mortality rate of early births in the country by 1/3, while severe complications of premature births have declined significantly, significantly increasing the survival of premature children.
The project, through the establishment of a national network for the improvement of the quality improvement of newborns, introducing collaborative quality improvement concepts, radiation-wide 25 collaborative hospitals in China, establishing a collaborative set of collaborative improvements for early births, improving the level of newborn treatment, systems and effective collaborative quality improvement methods.

It is understood that in the China Project for Early Childhood Improvement, the Paediatric Hospital introduced the EPIQ approach into 25 large NCUs in 19 provinces throughout the country, working to address the problem of premature childhood infection that plagues the Chinese neonatal care room.
After more than 10 years, the survival rate of premature births in Canada has increased by about one third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world's pre-natals.
The EPIQ method is now applied to all the NCUs across Canada and are applied by six countries.
Paediatric hospitals revealed that the results of the study showed that the EPIQ intervention had dropped by 35% after two years of intervention, while antibiotics had dropped by 20%.
In the future, the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Jordan will continue to promote and implement it nationwide, focusing on a comprehensive reduction in the incidence of all complications of premature children and improve the quality of newborns throughout the country.
There are differences and imbalances in China's levels of treatment in all regions.

It is understood that the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Jordan is working together to develop guidelines for the treatment of newborn infections, based on project experience, providing reference and guidance to the normative treatment of newborn infections in China.
It was revealed that in 2019, the China Neonatal Collaboration Network, located at the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Jordan, will jointly conduct a national phase of national quality improvements to promote the level of newborn treatment in China.
According to the Director of the Shanghai City Health Planning Commission, Shanghai could be the central city of the Asian centre, not only in research, but also the construction of the service system, and the quality of services and service results should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China's medical level.

This hero monument, no damage or destruction.
For a while, history has been in a state of disillusion, and so on.
A variety of historical distortions, derogatory practices, challenging just conscience, false value judgement, causing public anger and alert to society.
Young cannot be desecrated, and heroes cannot forget.
It is impossible to touch the bottom line, and it must be bold to light the sword and defend the dignity of England with the rule of law.
On May 1, this year, the Heroes Martyrs Protection Act was officially implemented.
In terms of judicial practice, the judgement of some cases is very fast, effective in maintaining the bright image of the British and the glory of the glory and the positive energy of the world.
A nation with pursuit cannot be without heroes, and an ideal country cannot be without a pioneer.
Remembering the first, calling for heroes, has become a universal social consensus.
Currently, there are millions of memorial facilities in the country, and more than 100 million visits to martyrs' mausoleum every year.
The heart is the strongest cornerstone.
Let the hero, defend heroes, learn heroes, love heroes, and bring the spirit into the blood of the nation, and a "hero memorial" will stand between the heavens and the earth, deep.

The national non-film cotton field viewing and seminar exchange expert went into the test field and heard a presentation by representatives of the Chinese Engineering Academy of Engineering.
On September 30th, the new network, Xinjiang, is located at the non-film cotton cultivation test base in Xinjiang Shaya County, with a "no colorless" compared to the membrane cotton, with a white cotton race, full of branches.
From 27 to 28 September, the national membrane-free cotton field viewing and seminar exchange was held in Xinjiang Shaya County.
At the Games, journalists learned that the non-film-free cotton technology system, subject to the "China Cotton 619" and its associated cultivation measures, initially achieved the goal of non-film cultivation in cotton fields, reducing significant progress in the pollution of the membrane to the ecological environment and the original cotton in Xinjiang, and the research and demonstration of membrane-free cotton.
Member of the Chinese Engineering Institute, a well-known cotton genetic breeder, the chief scientist of the cotton system of the modern agricultural industry technology system, known as the Secretary of the Zhejiang Agroforestry School, Zhou Guo Moo, presented the filmless cotton growth.
" The membraneless cotton complex technology we developed can fully achieve cotton cultivation without membrane cultivation, which can completely address the problem of membrane pollution and achieve green cotton planting ... "
The Chinese Engineering Academy is a quick introduction to the tree.
Xinjiang is China's most important cotton-producing area, and according to the National Statistical Office, Xinjiang cotton cultivation in 2017 was 35 million acres, representing 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of the film in 1982, the area of crops of the Xinjiang region has more than 50 million acres, with about 300,000 tons per year.
Of these, cotton membrane coverage is 100%, and cotton fields account for about 60% of Xinjiang membrane use.
The non-film cotton is measured, and cotton production can produce 320 to 350 kg of acre.
With the increasing input of the membrane in Xinjiang, the residual membrane recovery rate has gradually increased in soil, a series of problems such as soil structural damage, which seriously affects sustainable agricultural development.
The membrane is not only severely contaminated with soil, but also has a significant impact on the quality of cotton fibres.
Currently, more than a third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang machine cotton was about 14 million acres.
The machine's cotton harvest has a large amount of surface, and the fragmentation of the cotton plant, which is mixed with the original cotton process is difficult to remove during the process of cotton processing, and it is not completely removed in the subsequent textile processing process, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28th, the national membrane-free cotton field viewing and seminar exchange was held in Xinjiang Shaya County.
To focus on the pollution of cotton fields, simplify cotton planting techniques and improve the benefits of cotton fields, and the tree quickly led his team through eight years to implement the "film-free cotton technology in the Middle Cotton 619" to add to the green development of Xinjiang agriculture.
The tree is a quick introduction to the new idea of innovative breeding, the pre-precision, salt-resistant, low temperature, rich land cotton new product system, the cotton 619.
" The Middle Cotton 619' has achieved a series of accompanying measures such as a membraneless plant in the southern part of Xinjiang. "
Currently, a membraneless cotton demonstration base has been established in Aksu, Kurle, Alar, with production of 4,800 kg per ha.
Cotton-free cultivation, production, festival, environmental protection, integrated benefits.
Zhang Denghai, the third teacher of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of non-film cotton cultivation technology research and demonstration, the production of non-film cotton seed cotton cotton seeds can fully produce 320 kg to 350 kg, or even higher.
"The promotion of non-film cotton cultivation technologies is promising ... "
Zhang Donghai believes that the current membrane-free cotton cultivation technology can completely address the soil membrane pollution problem, but there is a gap between economic benefits than membrane cultivation.
" The support of cotton acquisition prices will facilitate future outreach ... "
The next step, he and his team will continue to study in-depth and large-scale applications of membrane-free cotton, making the membrane-free cotton industry a strong solution to soil pollution caused by the membrane.

According to the subsidiary arrangements for the trade agreement published on Monday, the new United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain the ability of President Trump to impose a 25 per cent tariff threat to imported cars, while basically exempts customs duties on vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico.
If Trump has a so-called "232" tariff on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada will have 2.6 million passenger vehicle quotas exported to the United States each year.
In accordance with subsidiary arrangements, the pickup produced in both countries will be fully subject to tariff exemptions.
If Trump plus a car tariff, Mexico will receive a $1080 billion tax exemption quota for car parts per year, and Canada will receive a $32.4 billion quota.
Both quotas are far higher than the existing production levels in both countries, providing growth space for exports between the two countries.
Reuters Washington/Mexico 28 September - Mexico stated on Friday that, after several days of debate, the government of President Trump and Canada are making effective efforts to address trade policy differences and make the outside world look forward to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to maintain the form of the Tripartite Agreement.
Although there is no detail, the obvious progress described above is sufficient to prompt Mexico and the United States Government to suddenly cease the plan to publish the text of the two-party trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has stated to journalists in Mexico that the United States Government had made new counter-recommendations to the Canadian Government and said he would continue to push three countries to participate in NAFTA.
According to the Minister of Economy of Mexico, Ildefonso Guajardo, the time to submit the text of the American-Murk trade agreement to Mexico and United States legislation was postponed because Canada and the United States Government tried to reach an agreement.
Guahardo said, " In the next 48 hours, we will know that we have to reach a Tripartite Agreement or have to publish the text of the two-party agreement ... "
Guahardo said his American and Canadian equivalent officials "specially requested" to delay the release of the text.
The spokesman for the United States Trade Representative Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the American-Murk trade agreement and consultations between the United States and Canada.
Officials of the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of Foreign Affairs did not respond to the request for comment on counter-recommendations.
According to foreign media reports, in a nursing centre on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa, two lions are playing together, and it's hard to see anything unusual, but they're nothing.
The University of Pretoria announced: " This is the first young lion born in artificial insemination - the first pair in the world. "
School scientists are working on the reproductive system of female African lions.
Ganswint, Director of the Institute of Mammalism at the University of Pretoria, said that the two lions born on August 25, were quite healthy and normal.
His team finally made this breakthrough after 18 months of intensive experiments.
Ganswint was interviewed by the media said: " We collect sperm from a healthy lion ... "
Next, when researchers and the hormones in the lions are at the right level, they are artificial insemination.
Ganswint said, " Fortunately, the result was successful ... "
He said, "the researchers have tried several times, but unexpectedly, it didn't cost too much."
He said that the above-mentioned breakthroughs can be verified, and scientists want to use this technology to save the endangered large cat animals.
According to the International Conservation Alliance, lions have been extinct in 26 countries in Africa, with the total number of wild lions living by 43% in the last 20 years, with about 20,000 left.
African lions are classified as vulnerable animals by this organization.
Ganswint said, " If we don't do something for this animal, they'll face extinction."
He said that this new technology does not require lions to be raised, but simply to inject sperm into the pregnant lions, as in North America and Europe to raise elephants.
Korea ' s exports fell the largest in September, but analysts blamed the decline on less working days and said that global demand for Korean commodities remained strong despite the rising trade tensions in China and the United States.
Indeed, Korea's average exports increased last month.
In addition, early start-value data show that exports in the first weeks of September before long holidays have increased in double numbers.
Korea ' s exports in September were the largest since July 2016, with a decrease greater than the estimated decrease of 11 analysts in the road-through survey.
The initial value published on Monday shows that exports in September amounted to $5.6 billion, below $5.1 billion in August.
Although the growing US-China trade dispute could lead to other export-dependent Chinese neighbours, Korea grew by 7.8 per cent to China in September, expanding in the 23rd consecutive month.
Korea's exports to the United States fell by 11.8%, due to the decline in sales of petroleum products.
Korean memory chips and petroleum products overseas sales increased by 28.3 per cent and 13.5%, respectively, although the market's so-called chip "supercycle" may have been at the top.
" However, the impact of trade conflict will be inevitable, as Korean exports depend heavily on United States and Chinese markets ... "
Imports declined by 2.1 per cent to $4.8 billion, and not as expected by the Reuters survey by 3.1 per cent.
Trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Ministry of Industry, global manufacturing will remain smooth by the United States and EU countries, which is a favourable factor for Korean exports.
The statement states that " the increase in export prices resulting from the rise in oil prices will also be beneficial to exports in the second half of this year ... "
"But the continued trade conflict between the United States and China, combined with the increase in market fluctuations after the rise in the United States, are negative pressures for exports ... "
Exports per working day increased to $2.6 billion in September, compared to $2.1 billion in August.
Korea fell on September 24-26 this year, so there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than last year.
Korea exports in January-September grew by 4.7 per cent over the same period last year.
According to the Daily/Markit Procurement Manager Index, Korean manufacturing activities rose back in September, but supported by domestic orders, as orders from China and Japan have fallen, which fears that other export prospects are in a state of shadow.
The Korean media criticized the United States for not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK.
North Korea's Labour News published a report on September 30, criticizing the United States for not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK while seeking dialogue with the Dynasty, calling it "controversial".
The article states that the United States Secretary of State Pompeyo called "the key to the non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the key to the implementation of sanctions against the DPRK " , emphasizing that the United States position remains unchanged.
In Singapore's joint statement on the United States of America, the two sides committed to establishing a new Korean-American relationship with the desire of the peoples of the United States to look forward to peace and prosperity.
The United States has increased the pressure of sanctions and requires dialogue, which is undoubtedly contradictory.
The article states that if a new relationship between the United States of America is to be established, a permanent and consolidated peace system in the Korean peninsula and achieve a completely nuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the construction of trust should be first, starting with what can be done, and to be resolved in one phase by phase.
The article also states that the United States should understand that sanctions are not working on North Korea.
The article says that even the North Devonsk before Kazan is a compliment.
The National Interest magazine quotes the US Navy's view: "We'll meet a strong potential opponent. Just look at the North Devonsk submarine. "
The current Commander-in-Chief of the European Navy, Fogo, also praised the North Devonsk submarine.
He said, " This submarine is impressive. Look at the development of the Russian Navy and how resources will be used to know that the main efforts they have done in research and development are first and foremost to strengthen the submarine fleet ... "
But the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains a advantage in Russia in this field.
Fogo said: " I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantage ... "
There were reports that the Russian Navy will be putting the Kazan submarine in 2019.
Kazan, New Siberia, Krasnoyarsk, "Alhanglesk" multipurpose submarines are improved by the White Wax Tree-M, with 13800 tons of drainage, 520 metres below dive depth, 64 personnel, 31 knots of underwater speed, with mines, torpedoes and "calibre" and "Zamana" cruise missiles.

Ignore America's threat!
EU or will reach an agreement on crude oil procurement with Iran
The United States Government has recently claimed that a new round of sanctions against Iran will be restarted in November, even urging other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
But American allies don't seem to hear it.
According to the New York Times, on 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed that, despite the threat of the United States threatening to impose sanctions on any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is approaching an agreement with the EU on the sale of crude oil.
The central purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism that replaces dollar transactions in a price-effective manner.
The purpose of this method is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the contribution of the agreement, some French and British officials are concerned that if the agreement is realized, it would be the most open confrontation between the United States withdrawal from the EU and the United States.
According to the media, in an hour, Zarif's words sound more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to "defeat" the traditional allies of the United States and effectively break the United States's attempts to cut Iran's income.
" This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit " , Zarif believes that according to the agreement reached in 2015, States have the legitimate right to trade with Iran ...
Federika Mogarini, the head of foreign policy of the EU, also stated that " no sovereign State or organization may accept anyone else to decide who they can trade with ... "
However, she also predicted that before the United States Government launched its next sanctions in November, United States leaders might take a range of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries with Tehran.
In May this year, the United States Government announced its withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Agreement on the grounds of the defects of the agreement and stated that the agreement could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The United States then threatened to ban companies buying Iranian oil and other goods to operate in the United States.
This threat caused some companies to evacuate Tehran and the Iranian currency fell.
Airbus and French oil giant Dodal have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said that the U.S. government might be "higher."
In fact, according to a recent Turkish media report, US sanctions do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iranian oil minister Zangane has recently revealed that no other country except Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Zalif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that a series of American acts are intended to "stract" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also ashamed of a series of oral attacks on the United States, and Zarif even laughed when asked whether the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, " it was a strategy of regime change, which is the true purpose of the United States ... "

Reuters Nagoya November 5th - On Monday, President of the Central Bank of Japan, Heda Dong-hyun, stated that the central bank was aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-easing monetary policy could squeeze the profitability of financial institutions and could undermine the stability of the banking system in the country.
But he said that, given the uncertainty of inflation and the uncertainty of overseas economies, the Central Bank of Japan needs to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan while following closely the advantages and disadvantages of its policies.
"The Central Bank of Japan fully recognizes that, under sustained monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected, " Heda Dong-hyun stated in Nagoya ' s speech to business leaders ...
He said that if financial institutions were more active in taking risks to compensate for the impact of low interest rates in the years, the banking system could be volatile once a serious negative impact.
" While these risks are not very high at this point, central banks will follow closely the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures " .
The records of the Central Bank of Japan meeting earlier on Monday show that at the September conference, the Central Bank Policy Committee of Japan discussed the rising cost of long-term easing policies.
The meeting records show that a member stated that if the economy continued to expand, " the future space for the Central Bank of Japan has more flexibility in policy ... "
The meeting records show that another member stated that, given the limitations of policy continuity, the Committee should discuss how long the Central Bank of Japan can sustain stimulus policies.
Heda Dong-hyun stated that the Central Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks posed by easing policies, while considering uncertainty around Japan ' s economic prospects, which may affect global demand because of friction and growing protectionism in China and the United States.
"The impact of such issues on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited, as Heda Dong-hyun says ...
"But how the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy could be greater, and he added...
"There is a need to continue strong monetary easing policies while considering positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner, " Heda Dong-hyun said ...
Although the disadvantages of radical stimulus schemes have increased, such as long-term low interest rates erode the profits of financial institutions, inflation is forcing the Central Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Central Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the end of the global trade war, Heda Toshio has ruled out the possibility of recent interest rates.
On June 1, 2018, the corporate logo on the Tesla electric car in Cardiff, USA.
Under a settlement agreement, the United States Tesla and its executive director Mask has agreed to pay the financial regulators a $20 million fine, and Mask will resign from the chairman of the company, but still as CEO.
The settlement agreement will mark Tesla's two months of turmoil.
This securities fraud and settlement agreement disclosed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday will ease investors.
Investors were worried that the protracted legal struggle would only further combat this electric car company that was still losing.
The SEC sued Mask fraud on Thursday, claiming that its tweets of August 7 misled investors.
According to the tweet, he is considering privatization of Tesla and has been financed for $420 per share.
SEC states that these tweets are not actually unfounded, and the market turmoil it causes undermine investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say that the agreement may enhance Tesla, which has been severely damaged by Mask's recent behaviour.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common Asset Management, said that the settlement agreement should be more supervised by Mask and did not take the "destructive" measure to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds Panasonic shares, a battery manufacturer in Tesla.

General Secretary Xi made a very important speech at the private business symposium, giving firm confidence in the direction of the private economy towards a wider stage.
Secretary Xi stressed that "Let entrepreneurs take off their minds and move forward" have a strong resonance among a wide range of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamics come from people, especially entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of stories of entrepreneurial innovation, and the growth of the entrepreneurial community has been growing and pushing forward to the collapse of the Chinese economy.
For some time, people in society have made some denials and doubts about the private economy.
Misstatements such as the so-called "private economic departure theory" have caused doubts and concerns from some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have experienced a number of difficulties and problems in business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment affect some export enterprises; rapid demand restructuring has pressure on transition upgrading; some policies are not coordinated, policy effects are overlapping, or simple working methods, leading to the opposite role of some of the original good policies, etc.
The factors are intertwined, the private economy is difficult, and some private businesses are in trouble, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
Against this background, it is particularly relevant to correct awareness of the error, remove the burden of entrepreneurs, to develop businesses with all their heart, and to promote development, and market confidence and development expectations.
This symposium once again highlighted the important argument of "three unchanged": "The status and role of the non-public economy in our economic and social development have not changed!"
From in-depth promotion of the right to decentralization, establishing a system of authority to create a rule of law environment that protects the legitimate rights of entrepreneurs, creating a market environment for fair competition, shaping the atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs throughout society, and in recent years, the importance of the party ' s central importance to entrepreneurs, and unprecedented institutional safeguards.
The symposium was more clearly proposing a strong support for the growth of private enterprises in six aspects of policy initiatives, launching a series of practical actions dedicated to private enterprises "light-dressing forward".
This is a great inspiration for the entrepreneurial community, giving more expectations from all sectors of society.
The fog is open, the approach is set, the key is to implement.
To create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in development and help to transform China’s economic transformation; to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legitimate operations, respect in social life, stimulate innovation and create potential.
China’s economy is entering the process of moving towards high-quality development requires more entrepreneurs' ambitions and provides greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to be creative.
We have reason to believe that, with further deepening reforms and removing obstacles, the private economy will bring better prospects and opportunities for development and towards a wider stage.

As the country's "a long way" is deepening, as one of China's easiest access to South-East Asia, the port of the river has grown steadily.
At 7:30 a.m., the sun just appeared, and the area at the port of the river had gathered early and early to watch the flag-raising ceremony and tourists from the river.
At 0745 hours, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the National Gate Guard team at the river mouth station was shaking and escorted the flag to the flag.
After the commander reached the flag-up command, the flag raised his arms and waved out a arc, and the bright five-star red flag spreads the flag like the Eagle Wing, and it rises slowly with the great melody of the national anthem.
" At every New Year's Day, Spring Festival, the National Day, the National Day, etc., the National Day, the National Day, not only the image of China, but also inspires the patriotism of the people of the border ... "
The soldiers of the army who participated in this flag-up ceremony said,

During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive information around the Korean peninsula.
Korean President Wen has spoken about the "unreversible" nuclear determination of the Korean side and stated that President Trump and the Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, may meet by the end of this year.
The U.S. Department of State subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeyo would visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the commitment of the leaders of the United States of America to meet with Singapore.
From the beginning of this year, the Koreans have opened the path to dialogue, and the Korean, Korean and American leaders met, and the slow trend in the peninsula has continued and the principle of dialogue to address the peninsula has been upheld.
First, the "the essence of the peninsula is the security issue" has not changed, and the key is to achieve peace in the peninsula, and the key is to balance the reasonable security concerns of the good parties, rather than putting pressure on each other, emphasizing their claims.
Second, in the dialogue to achieve the non-nuclearization of the peninsula, the differences between the steps and ways of achieving the nuclearization of the peninsula are still strong because of the long lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States.
The recent public meeting on the Korean Peninsula, held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the parties once again highlighted these two points on the issue of the peninsula on the issue of sanctions.
United States Secretary of State Pompeyo insists that sanctions on North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean peninsula is completely denuclearized.
And Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed the principle of "to respond to action with action", saying, "The weakening of sanctions should be synchronized with the pace of North Korea on the gradual abandonment of nuclear roads " .
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Council ' s resolutions in full, complete and accurate, but pressure is not intended, and the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of political settlement is the requirement of Council resolutions, and the two cannot be rejected.
As the Chinese State Commissioner and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, given the current positive progress in Korean and the United States relations, China believes that the Council needs to consider launching reversible provisions in due course, thereby encouraging North Korea and the parties concerned to take a greater pace towards non-nuclearization.
Recalling the past, every progress in the peninsula's non-nuclearization and peace process requires sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote political resolution of the peninsula, the parties concerned should particularly demonstrate political ambitions, political decisions, implement commitments, resolve challenges, and continue to move forward the nuclearization process of the peninsula and the establishment of the peninsula peace mechanism, and to create permanent peace in the peninsula.

Reuters Tokyo October 1st - The short-sighted survey quarterly published by the Central Bank of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in September touched the lowest level for more than a year because of rising raw materials costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production, resulting in pressure on businesses.
This survey has hardly shown that the rising global trade friction has hit the confidence of large manufacturing people.
But the risk of a full-scale trade war has hit the business prospects of the enterprise and may threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital spending is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey questioned the view of the Bank of Japan on robust economic expansion that would help boost inflation to a 2 per cent target, although there are indications that businesses are gradually turning costs to clients.
" In the context of concern at the global trade war, manufacturing confidence has stalled because of the slowdown in export slowdown and weak plant production, " as stated by Nan Wuji, Chief Researcher of the General Institute of Agriculture and Forestry.
"confidence is still high... and because business profits are improving and price increases, I do not think confidence will continue to decline ... "
Short-sighted surveys show that the large manufacturing landscape index in September fell from the positive 21 to 19 three months ago, which deteriorated for the third consecutive season.
The market estimates are positive 22.
The large non-manufacturing landscape index dropped from the June survey to 22 for the first time in eight quarters.
The Reuters investigation is positive.
The survey showed that the large manufacturing and non-manufacturing gas judgement index remained steady in December.
Investors do not care about the decline in the short-sighted corporate landscape index, and the daily stock index. N225 rises Monday to 27 years high, helping to improve the prospects for the profits of Japanese enterprises.
Capital spending is robust.
Despite the decline in corporate confidence, the latest short view highlights the robust enterprise capital spending plan, thanks to updating capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to address the shortage of labour due to population ageing.
Central Bank short-term surveys show that large enterprises plan to increase capital spending by 13.4% for the current fiscal year by March 2019.
The previous short survey was 13.6 %.
South Wuji said that all corporate capital spending plans increased by 8.5% in the fiscal year, approaching the pace of the Japanese bubble economy.
He stated that " given that there is still room for further growth in capital spending, given that small enterprises have increased their profits from now on, but this depends largely on the impact of trade wars on corporate confidence ... "
Short-term surveys show that the increased capacity of enterprises to transfer costs, with the price index of large enterprise output at a positive seven-year high point, an encouraging sign that reflects progress in Japan ' s efforts to combat deflation.
The index of measuring employment in large enterprises touched negative 23, the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tension in the employment market.
Thanks to the strong corporate spending, the second season of the Japanese economy rebounded from the contraction in January-March this year.
But the summer trade friction upgrades and the supply chain is disturbed by natural disasters, making the Japanese economic prospects dependent on exports.

The 69th International Astronaut Congress opened on October 1st in Bremen, Germany, on October 1, with over 6,300 astronauts, space institutions and business representatives, expert scholars and young students from around the world.
Jean-Iv Legar, President of the International Astronautical Federation, addressed the opening ceremony that the global space cause was no longer the participation of only a few countries and institutions, and that the number of participants this year increased significantly over the previous session, indicating that an increasing number of institutions and people were joining them.

The General Assembly, for five days, co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the University of Bremen, the Centre for Applied Science and Microgravity Research, the International Society of Space Law, etc.
Reuters Beijing November 5th - Press release issued by the China Foreign Trade Center on Sunday that the meeting showed that the foreign trade situation in China remained complex and 80.6 per cent of businesses expected to be better than last year or even in 2018.
However, given the continued increase in costs of integrated elements such as domestic raw materials, labour force, the economic and American trade frictions have increased external environments, participating enterprises also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th General Assembly, the Under-Secretary-General, press spokesman, Deputy Director of the China Foreign Trade Centre, Xu Jun, stated that the number and export transactions of buyers outside the present session were slightly reduced.
The current procurement board 189,812 from 215 countries and territories, a decrease of 1.11 per cent over the same period.
Exports are yuan 2,06494 million (equivalent to $2.98.6 billion), a decrease of 1 per cent over the same period.
In terms of the market, for Japan, ASEAN, the " BRICS " , the Korean deal grew by 74.4 per cent, 11.4 per cent, 7.2 per cent, 2.5%, and a decrease of 30.3 per cent for traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the EU, respectively, 8.9 per cent, 7.3 per cent, 0.8 per cent.

Xu Jin said that, as a barometer and wind target for foreign trade in China, the current meeting of buyers and exports showed that China ' s foreign trade development continues to face a number of uncertain instability next year.
But as supply-side structural reforms advance and recent policy measures such as "six-stable" in countries and regions, new energy for foreign trade development in China is accelerating the accumulation and new progress in the diversification of the enterprise market, which are important foundations and strong conditions for foreign trade development.
"In combination of factors, it is expected that China ' s foreign trade imports and exports will continue to grow steadily throughout the year and further improve in quality and efficiency ... "
The General Customs Administration of China announced that exports in September increased by 14.5 per cent over the same period in United States dollars, an increase of 14.3 per cent over the same period, a trade surplus of $31690 million in September, the highest rate of export growth and trade surplus since February of this year.
Despite the escalation of trade frictions in China and the United States, China ' s export performance in September was high, and the demand was high, and that companies had been devalued by the renminbi exchange rate before tariff increases in the United States, and the main support factor, and some extent, the resilience of China's foreign trade war, the impact of the trade war between China and the United States, and the impact on industrial chains was not too high, and analysts believe that the challenges of Chinese foreign trade could be visible in four quarters or next year.
The Reuters survey showed that in September the United States fund manager suggested increasing cash holdings and continued to remain cautious because the United States and China began the latest round of import tariffs and that the dispute had no signs of ease.
However, 12 fund managers involved in the survey suggested that North American asset allocations increased to the highest since June 2017, while the UK, the eurozone, especially emerging markets, declined.
The global stock allocation averages 56.6 per cent, with a bond ratio of 35.5%, largely consistent with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio has risen to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
The fund manager of a large fund company said that " some economic data has brought confidence in the market, but trade wars remain the greatest concern, so it is best to be prepared to enter when the market falls ... "
But fund manager still prefers stocks in September, especially US stocks, even if American stocks are considered to be high.
Today, the opening landmark in China in Shanghai, the world's first large national fair on the theme of import - the China International Import Fair, which is officially opened in the world.
A show is like a window that allows the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through the window of the Expo, people see moving towards a higher level of "open China"; with the "window" of the Expo, the world is welcome to win each other with the "reform opening and opening" China.
"For a country, openness is like a cocoon butterfly, which will experience pain, but will be replaced by a new generation ... "
Secretary Xi's summary of the open road has made an important reason for why China can.
Looking back at 40 years of reform and opening up, China, who dares into the sea of the world market, and despite the vortex and the wind, they have always faced all risk challenges with open gestures, constantly releasing internal dynamics and constantly improving competitive capacity.
It can be said that China has strongly interpreted the value and meaning of openness with its own solid achievements.
At the beginning of the new history, an exhibition on the theme of import is a major decision-making by the central centre of Comrade Xi Jinping to advance the new high-level open-up to the world, a major initiative of China to open markets to the world, and is a practical action for China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing the strong and clear will "the door to China's opening, only the bigger."
And the exhibitors are very popular, and the "one hard to ask" is the greatest certainty and best response to China in a wider, wider area, deeper development of an open economy.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries build high walls of trade protectionism, retreating the old unilateralist path, increasing the concerns of the international community about free trade prospects and adding uncertainty to the warming of the world economy.
Against this time, this event on the side of the Huangpur River reflects China's defence of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets, share future confidence and China's responsibility.
Walk alone, walk away.
China opens their hearts and embraces the world, not only to promote its own development, but also the "China opportunities" to all countries and regions of the world.
In recent years, advocacy and promotion of co-building " , the launch of the Asian Investment Bank, the establishment of the Silk Road Fund China has provided a series of international public products that provide real export markets, development opportunities and jobs to allow enterprises to travel to China to develop fast cars.
The Expo is also a public product, a platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and territories are shining with a unique quality product and services, taking a new step in the Chinese market.
Besides businesses in all countries, there are domestic consumers.
By building this platform for "Electual Excellence" provides multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrades to meet the individualization, diversity, differentiated consumption needs of the population.
As China opens the doors open, the goods flow, the things are done, and the steps to a better life will be stronger.
From a more macro point of view, the meaning of the Expo has gone beyond the economic and trade sphere, but to the future, to convey open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, win-win ideas that form a common consensus to address today's challenges.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to the world's glory and success; we look forward to a higher level of "open China" and the world to build the glorious future of the community of human destiny.

Over 90% of Brazilian women voters say the presidential candidate did not take into account the needs of women.
According to the South American Overseas News Network, data recently published by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) show that over 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not consider presidential candidates to consider the needs of women.
According to reports, the number of women in Brazil has now reached 107 million, and that if all Brazilian women are brought together into a country, the country's population will be ranked 13th in the world, with more than two times the population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of female voters accounts for 52 per cent of the total number of voters, and men account for 48%, although women are very high, the proportion of women is only 10% in the Brazilian Congress.
In 193 countries around the world, Brazilian women are ranked only 154th in politics, higher than the Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of rights struggle, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in obtaining their right.
The Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori noted that the reason for this phenomenon was the result of the common role of the ancient patriarchal society, racism and capitalist values.
" Politics should have been a national claim for civil rights, identity, public products and consists of the same society by multiple social groups ... But Brazilian politics belongs to a monopoly of a group, and most of the population is not represented ... "
A previous study by the Brazilian Motor Institute (Locomotiva) also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women do not feel that politicians arising from elections can represent their rights, 90 per cent of Brazilian women disagree with the decisions made by politicians, 93 per cent of women disagree with the current government's governance policy.
"We need to reverse the issue of underrepresented women in Parliament, and the political system in Brazil remains affected by inequality. So far, there is still a serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political sphere in Brazil. " Natalie Mori said.
Despite the insufficient rights of women, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
According to the survey, 76% of women believe that they can do something in democratic elections and 72% of women are politically interested in politics.
Moreover, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women less biased.

Despite the continued earthquake in the global financial market, the Hong Kong Financial Authority stated on Monday that foreign exchange funds had reduced their investment income by 97 per cent annually in the third quarter of this year, better than last season, and that overseas stocks were rising and that foreign exchange losses were significantly narrowed under the trade war between China and the United States of America.
According to the latest data from the Authority, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded $1.6 billion in investment revenues in July-September 2018, significantly below HK$ 61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than HK$ 100 million revised in the second quarter of this year.
In the Legislative Council, President of the Golden Authority, Chen Deok-hyun, stated that the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indices were contrary to the United States stock index at the end of September, when the United States stock market index rose in early October, market sentiment began to reverse, as investors realized that trade war was also harmful to the United States itself.
"It's good to change in market emotions, and if trade wars have only unilateral effects, it doesn't help to solve things ... "
But he also noted that " financial market volatility will continue to rise if the Chinese-United States trade war has not been resolved ... "
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund ' s stock investment losses in Hong Kong were narrowed from HK$ 8 to HK$ 4.7 billion in the previous quarter, compared with HK$ 172 to HK$ 12.8 billion; foreign exchange losses were HK$1.2 billion, with bond gains of HK$97 billion, reduced by 24 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively, reflecting the general increase in the United States dollar to major currencies and the US interest rate in September.
Foreign exchange funds are used mainly to support HK$.
Hong Kong has been implementing a connection exchange rate system linked to the United States dollar since 1983.
For the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Deok-hyun stated that uncertainty in economic and asset markets has increased, but the Hong Kong financial system is robust and defensive and earthquake resistance.
" Hong Kong ' s international investment position is sufficient, with a net external asset value of 1.4 trillion equals four times the GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore and 0.6 times Japan, and to deal with the lower economic cycle or reversal is sufficient ... "
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar's interest rate continued to fall and expanded with the dollar, and Chen Deok-chun noted that the Hong Kong dollar exchange price had risen by more than 400 base points on 21 September, where the market generally believed to be mainly related to the rise in Hong Kong dollar, and that the subsequent HK$ to the United States dollar wandered at a level near 7.80-7.84, and that the recent Hong Kong dollar interest rate was continued to return to the United States dollar, expanding with the dollar, which could attract the market to buy HK$, and that the Hong Kong dollar again triggered the weak exchange guarantee than the previous period.
But he believes that as the Bank's interest rate starts with the start of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, the future Hong Kong dollar interest rate below the United States dollar rate will change.
" The Hong Kong dollar interest rate will be more consistent with the trend of the United States dollar interest rate, and must be more careful to manage risks and prepare to cope with market fluctuations ... "
As a result of the high funding of the Hong Kong dollar, the interest rate of the Hong Kong dollar was further returned, and the interest rate was reduced by 0.9 per cent to 2.08179 per cent on Monday in three months, and the interest rate difference was expanded from 46 base points to 51 base points; the interest rate break was five months a month, and the interest rate difference was expanded from 120 base points to 127 base points.
From May to mid-September, the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate was close to $7.85 to $1.
During the period, as a result of factors such as the flow of funds from the exchange of shares after the completion of the stock-raising campaign and the completion of the large equity campaign, the weak exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August after the first trigger in April.
The Authority buys HK$ at 7.85 levels in accordance with the contact exchange rate system to export the United States dollar to maintain the stability of the HK dollar exchange rate.
The Authority bought about HK$52.1 billion under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism in May and August.

The services of the Moonko Club directly affect the comfort and physical recovery of the mother's children, and some small moon children can only provide simple moon-child services, there are non-standard disinfection, cross-infective infections, single unscientific eating.
The head of the Moon Center said they were the only one in all the five-star Moon Center in Tianjin City who was certified as B-class service.

Reuters Hong Kong on November 5th - Hong Kong Building prices returned for two months after the top, and the President of the Hong Kong Financial Authority, Chen Deok-hoon, said on Monday that it would take time to observe whether the city has entered the lower cycle, and if confirmed, the policy of the tightness of the reverse cycle can be considered at the appropriate time.
Chen Deok-chul also said that if the price of the building was turned back, the first time it would be affected by the people who would be working at the peak of the building, but the price of the building was expected to fall in the Asian financial storm in 1997, and that citizens had a lot of less expensive prices to sell the property.
Chen Deok-hoon led a number of tops of the Golden Authority to the Legislative Council briefing that if it was confirmed that the city had entered the fall cycle, they could be relaxed at due time.
"But it's only a few weeks of data, and relaxing is still early, and it takes more time to see if the city is going to enter the lower cycle ... "
Since 10 2009, the Authority has so far launched eight rounds of reverse cycle measures to significantly tighten mortgages in various properties, including reducing mortgages, and mortgage applicants must pass rigorous pressure tests to enhance bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest rate cycle, the Hong Kong private residential price index was seen for two months in August-September, with a monthly drop of 1.44 per cent in September.
But the cumulative increase in the first three seasons of this year is 10.2%.
According to the Authority, the financial situation of households that measure the earthquake resistance capacity in Hong Kong to financial risk remains healthy, with 66% of households without mortgages in Hong Kong in the second quarter of this year, higher than the average mortgage in 2009-11; and 47 per cent and 34 per cent of new mortgages, respectively, 64 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively.
But Chen Deok-chul said that the anti-shock resistance does not mean that citizens in the industry will not be damaged by the economy, as property valuation will fall and the people who buy buildings at peak will be the first to be the first.
Although the Authority tightens the bank's lending to mortgage lenders, the builder can also obtain a number of mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Chen Deok-chul said that the borrower's mortgages could be 85-90 per cent, and that negative assets would occur if the price of the building fell by 10% (i.e. the market value of the property fell below the total amount of unpaid mortgage loans).
However, the Vice President of the Golden Authority, Nguyen Guo-hyun, stated that the authorities estimated to provide a high-scale total of mortgages by developers, representing only 2-2.5 per cent of the total bank mortgage, and that the proportion remains low.
At the peak of Hong Kong ' s negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, or 22 per cent of the number of people supplied.
And by the third season of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive seasons.

Systematic red hysteria is a chronic problem with a tired and full-body dirty device, which was previously considered "untreatment."
The lack of effective treatment due to the unknown treatment mechanism, the lack of effective treatment.
Recently, Liu Wanri, a researcher at the Faculty of Life Sciences, Qinghua University, and the Director of the Wind and Humid Immunization Centre at the People's Hospital of Beijing University, found the molecular mutation of human immunoglobins that increased systemic red-scabs, and this mutation was involved in the regulation of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams have confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systematic red-scaws.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaojun, the North Great People ' s Hospital, the Chestnut team collected nearly 2,000 large samples and studied and studied, and found that the incidence and severity of inflammation such as immunoglobin mutation produced a significant increase in the incidence and severity of inflammation such as immunoglobin mutation.
The Liu Wanri team, through a variety of research methods such as immunocell trace, animal testing, sequence, etc., has discovered the immune signal route of this immunomolecular mutation, which promotes the disease mechanism for B-cells of multiple antibodies.
Journalists learned that the two teams were strong and fully integrated with their respective advantages, and that basic research was closely integrated with clinical applications.
The Liu Wanri team is dedicated to the B-lymphet cell immuno-identification, immunoactive research, and the Chestnut team has long been engaged in clinical research on systematic red cynics.

It's not short, it's legal.
The lawyer is in court with an axe?
The news was really exciting at first glance and blew up the pot in the legal circle.
The Chinese law of Fujianquan City then fined $500 to the lawyer involved and wrote that the Quanzhou Bar Association be investigated.
According to the New Kyoto newspaper, the Zhang Quanzhou Law Association issued an official briefing that the two lawyers did not deal with violations and were not punished under the law.
From many reports, the Quanzhou Law Association is not a short-term or confrontation, but is recognized by the Spring Middle Court.
A incident that could have triggered tensions within the legal community was finally properly resolved.
The reversal of things is derived from a more complete truth: the axe carried by the lawyer is the same type as the defendant's murder weapon, but without a blade, only supporting evidence at the evidence, without intimidation or "risk the security of the court".
Four very important details require concern to determine whether the lawyer's conduct is illegal, and there are four very important details: first, the local court has two previous sessions, with only an axe photo, which is necessary from a defence point of view; second, the axe was purchased an hour before the opening of the court, not to seek the consent of a judge, but not objectively unable to contact the judge; third, the whole axe was not over-excited or inappropriate; fourth, the lawyer involved in public recognition and apologized to the court at the first time.
In sum up these cases, it shows that the lawyer "with an axe" is not a crime, just to defend.
After clarifying the whole fact, the Quanzhou Law Association did not push the boat, but put pressure on making a decision that was not punished.
And this decision can also be tested by facts and laws.
As for bringing an axe as a control knife to court without court permission, it is really easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For safety and caution, the previous fine punishment and judicial advice of the Quanzhou Middle Court are not very generous.
In order to maintain the dignity of lawyers and to prevent individual courts from taking trouble, the Supreme Law issued the " Rules for the Security Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People ' s Court " in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not require personal security checks.
Since the release of the rule, there are few incidents that have affected the security of the court due to security due to security.
In a very different case like Quanzhou, misunderstandings are not difficult to eliminate if they communicate in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.

The early Okinawa elections were announced in the morning of the morning of local time, as a result of the death of the former Kung-Hung-Hung, who opposed the relocation of the Japanese-American military base, was successfully elected.
The election was voted on September 30th, and the final results showed that Jade City had received 39,66.32 million votes, the highest in the history of Okinawa County, over 80,000 votes more than his main candidate.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24 per cent, a decrease of 0.89 percentage points compared to the 2014 Okinawa County Information Elections.
On 1st, Yu City stated to the media that the election results showed that the county people did not want to let the Chief know what he had before being born, he would inherit the legacy of the Secretary-General and continued efforts to the Japanese government and the United States Government, such as the closure of the United States military base and the closure of the universal base.
The U.S. military base, located in Ino Bay, Okinawa County, has been suffering from a long time, and the Japanese-American government had agreed to move it to the border of the city, but Okinawans strongly opposed the hope to move the base out of Okinawa completely.
With regard to the relocation plan strongly opposed by the county people and the request to withdraw the land-building permit on the coast of the border, Yu City stated that he had not been in a position of confrontation and division with the central government at first, hoping that the two sides would exchange their views fully, showing the intention to be resolved through consultation.

And he expressed his desire to meet Yu City.
Jade City will officially take office in Okinawa County on 4th this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China ' s demand for oilseeds has grown, Paul Thomas, a North Dakota farmer in the United States, has grown more and more soybeans in his land.
This shift peaked this year, and he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, reaching an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him planned to replant the main food crops in the American agricultural area in 2019: corn and wheat.
American farmers grow more soybeans this year than corn, for the first time in 35 years.
The plan to transform other food crops is due to the plight of American farmers selling soybeans in the context of US President Trump's trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of the US export soybeans, but because of trade wars, almost zero purchases of soybeans in recent months, leading to a drop in soybean prices to 10 years.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing dependence on crops that depend on China's demand.
Thomas says the soybean price "a painful blow to us."
He said that without China's demand, the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per plume ear, while the price required to cover the cost was $8.50.
American farmers are growing in a record high number this year, and the harvest is expected to be high.
At such a moment that was vulnerable, they were hit by trade wars.
In response to Trump's tariff on imports of Chinese goods, China imposed import duties on the import of soybeans in July.
The United States Department of Agriculture will issue its first estimate of the area of cultivation next year, which will contain considerations for tariff impacts.
It is expected that this estimate will confirm the expectations of private institutions to reduce the area of soybeans.
According to a report seen by Reuters, On 19 October, the area of corn cultivation is expected to increase by 4 per cent to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) by soybeans by 7 per cent to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects an increase in wheat cultivation in the United States by 4%.
The area of soybeans planted before retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
Corn cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008, to 89.1 million acres, with wheat cultivation of 47.8 million acres this year, with a minimum level of nearly 100 years.
Aron Carlson, President of the Illinois Corn Cultivation Association, has a total area of 3,600 acres, and nearly half of him this year was used to grow soybeans, but plans to cut in the future.
He said that corn cultivation could increase the area of corn by up to 20% on his farm in northern Illinois; the state was the largest soybeans growing state in the United States.
Soybeans are less than corn per acre, but less fertilizer required, which makes soybeans generally less growing.
If farmers are transferred to end-value corn, they may increase costs, but it will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Inc fertilizer sellers.
Executive Director Andersons Pat Bowe said to Reuters that he expected corn to facilitate fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the transfer of corn by farmers.

Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange position has been zero.
The central bank first released the data at the end of March 2016; the data show that the central bank's foreign currency at the end of February 2016 was $2,438 million in the forward contract and futures contracts of the currency, with an empty position of $2.89 billion.

On the night of September 20th this year, K158 trains went to the crane wall in Zhengzhou.
A master on the train bought no tickets, but took her seat: " Shoot the ball."
Two hours of drive, the train chief advised him to remain invalid for an hour.
Eventually, a male passenger in the same car couldn't watch and pull the master up.
In terms of public opinion, while most of the final results were condemned by the public, administrative punishment by the public security department and even blacklisted in good faith, the public still felt that it was not "recealing": why not punish the here?
Why can't it be prevented from immoral or even illegal acts on the spot, but to punish them later?
And why is it just a man's passenger who pulls it up for the rudeness of the Lord?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police and short-distance trains are generally not available; even if there are police officers, the police are concerned about the possible scoundrel response of the herds without the mandatory removal measures.
The repeated hegemony has made people realize that they must be forced away or even punished on the spot before they can be deterrentd.
This requires that our train take strong measures in time, and the train without the police should be equipped as soon as possible to keep the police out and combat violations in a timely manner.

Activate rural consumption, clean markets by normal mechanisms, guide healthy consumption demand and increase the sense of access to farmers' consumption.
Data show that rural population ' s consumption potential continues to be released, with a 10.5% increase in retailing in rural consumer goods in the first half of this year, increasing at a rate of 1.3 percentage points in towns.
In a poor village in a county in the west, there was only one convenience store in the village, and some of the goods seemed to have known each other, and the Golden Dragon Oil was marked as "Gold Dragon Oil," and "Wang Chai" became a lot of milk, and a lot of goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been exposed to some rural fake goods, close names, similar packaging, to false, preventable.
A consumption survey published in a city in the west shows that rural businesses are having a serious problem, with 66 per cent of users buying fakes at the town supermarket, with more than half of the food.
The authorities have been working on rural markets, and the annual cry, why are Li Ghost still fighting?
Unlike the urban market, farmers have a relatively weak awareness of rights, combined with a number of remote rural positions, in blind areas where there are enough regulatory power to feed the soil.
A multi-head tube, some sector-based prices, some pipe production, some pipe markets, cross-functioning, annual leave, focus on a wind, a fake, slowly coming out, just after old fakes, new fakes.
Lack of long-impact regulatory mechanisms, rural markets are difficult to cleanse, low-cost and high interest in rural markets, causing some illegal traders to drive the "down of the mountain" and some rural areas become a "defeating market".
From warmth to Xiaokang, the farmers are moving towards development consumption.
The party central, the State Council issued a number of comments on improving consumer institutional mechanisms to further stimulate the potential of consumption of the population, which proposed the upgrading of rural residents ' consumption ladders, with the aim of allowing farmers to " consume " willing " consumption " , making rural consumption truly flourishing.
On the one hand, we need to deepen reform, eliminate market regulation, multiple management disadvantages, local preparation, sound food safety, product quality monitoring networks, constantly compressing rural leave and selling leave space.
On the other hand, to increase law enforcement and to regulate the "sweet veins" will never be allowed to spread in rural areas.
Strict punishment of farmers is the care of farmers, whether much hidden by the fake, should not be the reason for the survival of false goods, and the authorities should be clearly responsible, and the fact that the authorities should clarify their duties, and the sinking of grass-roots regulatory forces, which is responsible for making leave, and the seller is free to hide.
Strict market access, strict qualifications for producers, traffic in the market, to get the product straight, go to the road, from the source, root, to make legal distributors safe, and make farmers safe.
Activate rural consumption to guide healthy consumption needs.
With consumption upgrades, many farmers seek not only eating, eating well, but also high-quality life such as culture, health, and so on, cannot bring rural markets with low quality "low quality" paintings.
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce to a wide range of rural areas, access to two-way distribution channels in urban and rural areas, promoting the integration of sub-industrial development platforms and online electrician trading platforms to support the expansion of new business patterns of consumption to rural markets; promoting the organic integration of commercial logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing; sound rural modern circulation network systems, optimize integration of stock facilities resources and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.
Create a clear, secure market environment for rural areas that make farmers consume less, and rural consumption can grow to increase the enjoyment and happiness of farmers' consumption.
