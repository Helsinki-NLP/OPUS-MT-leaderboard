The cumulative incidence of the new coronary virus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/European Economic Zone and the United Kingdom increased rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of new coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) in the EU/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, shows similar trends, confirming that although different countries are at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly.
According to Italian experience, the state, hospitals and intensive care wards need to be prepared to meet the surge in the number of COVID-19 patients, which are particularly serious.
On December 31, 2019, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, reported a number of cases of unidentified pneumonia.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control reported that pathogens were a new coronary virus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 are named coronary virus diseases (COVID-19).
Evidence so far shows that about 80% of COVID-19 cases are light, i.e. respiratory infections with or non-pneumonia, and most of them can recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 will progress into serious illness and need hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases will progress into severe illness and require intensive care.
The mortality rate for patients in hospital due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trend in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/European Economic Area, EA and the UK (UK) COVID-19 and compared it to Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
EU/ESA COVID-19 cases in the country and the United Kingdom
Following China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded further, and the dynamic changes in the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the European Surveillance magazine published on March 5, 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In EU/ESA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on January 24, 2020, with patients returning to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEC countries and the United Kingdom had detected cases of COVID-19, and from 31 December to 15 March 2019, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported in Italy alone.
Cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world at 8:00 a.m., which are available only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health, the National and National Health Authority and WHO.
These data have been used to assess trends in EU/ESA and the UK COVID-19 and compare them with Italy.
We calculated the 14-day cut-off rate for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom COVID-19 cases between 1 January and 15 March 2020 as an indicator of the incidence of active COVID-19 cases to consider the natural course of COVID-19.
We also provided the total number of cumulative cases reported in each country as of 15 March 2020, compared to data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
EU/ESA Country and United Kingdom COVID-19 Trends
The trend towards 14 days of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom is generally consistent with Hubei Province (China).
For EU/EA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 has increased since around 21 February 2020, and then has increased dramatically on 28 February (additional materials).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEC countries and the United Kingdom also presents similar growth trends (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the number of cumulative COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020, compared with Italy.
It should be emphasized that as of 8 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEC countries and the United Kingdom had reported the total number of cases comparable to Italy in less than three weeks.
Our results show that the number of cases reported by EU/EA and the UK are rapidly increasing.
The observed trend in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 shows that the epidemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, the national public health response measures vary, the definition of cases may vary in countries and is used to choose the options for COVID-19 confirmed tests, including additional tests - patients, are in the same situation.
In early March 2020, according to doctors in the affected areas of Italy, about 10% of COVID-19 patients need intensive care, while media reports indicate that hospitals and intensive care wards in these areas have reached maximum load.
At the EU/ESA level, the data available are currently available for COVID-19 cases in hospital/or entry into intensive care wards of only 6% and 1% (data not shown).
However, this information should be collected systematically in order to complement the current monitoring data on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 shows that there are significant differences in the number of intensive care and medium-term care beds available in European countries, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more resources than or less than Italy (per 100,000 people in 2010-2011 have 12.5 intensive care and medium-term care beds).
ECDC models the sixth update of COVID-19 rapid risk assessment for health care capacity saturation and estimates the relationship between each EU/EEC country and the British hospital COVID-19 patient and the risk of more than the size of the intensive care bed & gt; 90%.
As cases have so far gathered in EU/EEC countries and some regions of UK, and hospitals and intensive care wards usually serve population coverage in the identification area, it is preferable to provide information on cases and intensive care beds at the Standard Statistical Geographical Module 2 (NUTS-2).
Italian experience and current trends in other countries show that EU/EEC and the British COVID-19 pandemic are developing rapidly.
Thus, the State, hospitals and intensive care wards should be prepared to respond to the continued community dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and the need for health care, especially those in intensive care, such as the situation in the affected areas of Italy.
As the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment points out, a rapid, positive and comprehensive approach is essential to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2 and requires a transition from containment to mitigation methods, as the rapid growth of the expected number of cases may not allow policymakers and hospitals to understand, accept and adjust responses.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
There is a short-term opportunity window that countries may further increase control to reduce the speed of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and reduce pressure on health care systems.
Otherwise, the health care system in other EU/EA countries is likely to face a surge in need of intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronary virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths, causing a huge human disaster.
Similar to its congensive virus SARS-CoV - caused thousands of people infected with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and causes similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Although COVID-19 is lower than SARS, it is more contagious, with more affected older persons than young people and more men than women.
Given the rapid increase in publications related to the new coronary pneumonia, this paper wants to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving research topic.
We'll present basic knowledge of epidemiology, pathology, virus, diagnosis, treatment, pre- and post-preceivation.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this overview will help understand and eradicate this terrible disease.
The spring festival of January 25, 2020 became a memory that the Chinese had never had before, and the outbreak of a new viral disease forced everyone to stay out of the entire holiday and the following weeks.
The virus is highly common to the coronary virus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the related disease is called coronary virus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country, and then spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of whom more than 40,000 patients had been discharged and more than 3,000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 has become the number one public enemy, and its threat may exceed terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months since the first report on the separation of the virus sequence from multiple patients in less than two months, covering virals, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment.
This paper aims to summarize the progress of research in this emerging field of disciplines.
People are used to comparing COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss the knowledge learned so far on the prevention and pre-preparation of the disease, as well as some of the pressing issues to be addressed.
In the past, CoV was considered to be human non-lethal pathogens, mainly causing about 15% of the common cold 4.
But two highly sick humans have been encountered in this century, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which erupted in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, and soon spread to many other countries, with terrible morbidity and mortality rates.
So, the COVID-19 outbreak was the third CoV outbreak in human history.
As figure 1,1 shows, Wuhan City first reported several unknown cases of pneumonia to the China National Health and Health Commission on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was published.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first death.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20th, medical personnel were reported, suggesting that there might be a human phenomenon.
On January 23rd, Wuhan City closed the city and closed all public transport.
On January 24th, the first clinical study on new coronary pneumonia, of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the south seafood market in Wuhanhua, which was considered the starting point for infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO announced the outbreak as a "global health emergency".
As of the time of the present report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (figure 2 (Fig.2).
The final scope and severity of the outbreak are yet to be determined as a result of the rapid development of the epidemic.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study for 8,866 patients (including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients) provided an updated description of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPX1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 can infect all age groups, but the main age group is 30-65 years.
Almost half of the infected (47.7%) are over 50 years of age, very few under 20 years of age, and only 14 infected persons are under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/10 million) are more than women (0.27/10 million).
COVID-19 is concentrated in Hubei and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from disease to diagnosis.
The average insulation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from disease to death is 9.5 (4.8-13).
Basic regeneration (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people grew at an index level by January 23, 2020, consistent with the time of large population movement before China Spring Festival.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 are gender (male), age (60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large membrane virus sub-family with a single justice chain RNA.
They can be divided into four parts, namely alpha, beta, gamma and thorium, where alpha-CoV and beta-CoV are known to be infected with humans.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (S) are combined with their cell receptor vascular stress conversion enzymes 2 (ACE2) and diplypylase 4 (DPP4) and then membrane integration.
The virus RNA genome was released into cell mass; after the virus genome was replicated, the genome RNA formed a cyst of a virus-containing body with a membrane protein and a nuclear shell protein, and then integrated with the film and released the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
As a result, SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta-CoV, which was collected from the 10 sequenced samples collected from the Chinese seafood market in Wuhan, Wuhan City, with genetic consistency more than 99.98%.
SARS-CoV-2 is more geneticly similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in super thin slices on the skin of the human airway.
The study found that the human ACE2 was the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the combination of S protein and human ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is weak in line with the fact that the patient infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is less severe than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orf3b and an encoded protein by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may work and inhibit the expression of IFNbeta; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional structure domain or base sequence.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported on the frozen electronic microscope (cryo-EM) structure of a complex with amino acid trans-shipment protein B0AT1, with a resolution of 2.9 thiram.
They found that the compound had open and closed components, assembled into two clusters, and the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could combine two S proteins, thus providing evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 could be a treatment target for drug screening to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and middle host
As you know, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are both from bats and spread to humans through fruit beavers and camels.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoV systems, bats are considered natural host of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is consistent with two SARS samples from bats - called Bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 - 96%.
But it is not clear what the host helps the virus to infect humans across species barriers, and its transmission is also to be made clear.
Ji and others suggested that snakes are carried from bats to human viruses, involving co-source restructuring within S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China believe that, given that a CoV and SARS-CoV-2 found in mountain armor, a long kissing an ant, often used in Chinese medicine, is considered to be the potential host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes remains a huge difference; therefore, concrete evidence provides decisive results (figure (Fig.33).
The rational nature of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the dry environment for 48 hours, and can survive up to 5 days at 20 degrees C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be active to ultraviolet and thermal sensitivity - 56              .C. 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing, chlorine-containing, chlorinated and other lipid solvents can be effectively eliminated, but chlorine is not yet effective to eliminate the living virus.
Humans generally lack immunity from SARS-CoV-2, and therefore it is easy for this new virus.
There is no detailed study on the immunization response of SARS-CoV-2.
So we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (figure (Fig.4).
Generally, the virus is first identified by the host ' s inherent immune system (PRR) by mode, including C-type condensation receptor, Toll sample receptor (TLR), NOD sample receptor (NR) and RIG-I sample receptor (RLR).
The virus is expressed through different road-inducing inflammation factors, the maturity of tree mutation cells and the I-type jamming (IFN), which limit the transmission of the virus and accelerates the consumption of the virus's antigens.
But SARS-CoV's N protein can help the virus get rid of the immune response.
Adaptive immune responses will soon be added to the anti-attack virus.
T lymph cells, including CD4+ and CD8+T cells, play an important role in anti-virus defense.
CD4+T cell irritation B cells produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+T cells directly kill cells infected by the virus.
Auxiliary T cells produce inflammation cell factors to help the defense cells mentioned above.
But CoV can inhibit T-cell function by seducing T-cell collapse.
Physical fluid immunization, including supplements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, are also essential to resist virus infections.
For example, antibodies separated from recovered patients can be used to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive reaction of the immune system produces a large number of free foundations that may cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, causing multiple organ failure or even death in the worst circumstances.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, characterized by collective sexually transmitted diseases, are more likely to affect older persons with multiple complications and pregnant women.
Usually, the opportunity for individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or immune functions is higher than others.
According to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan City, the average insulation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated at 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average insulation period was 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As noted earlier, a recent study has shown that, according to demographic statistics of 8,866 cases, the period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust effective isolation time based on the most accurate insulation period, which prevents the spread of the virus to others without symptoms.
As a custom, the virus contact or infected person usually needs to be isolated for 14 days.
Should the time of isolation be extended to 24 days?
Heat is usually the main and first symptoms of COVID-19, which can be without any other symptoms, or symptoms such as dry cough, gas, muscle pain, headaches, pains, snorts, chest pains, diarrhoea, disgusting and vomiting.
Some patients have respiratory difficulties and/or low oxygen blood problems a week after the illness.
The serious ones will move rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis shock, metabolic acid poisoning and condensation functional disorders.
Even if there is no lung image anomaly, patients with heat and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be screened for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 shows that the percentage of symptoms is 98 per cent, dry cough 76%, breathing difficulties 55%, diarrhoea 3%; 8% of patients need air support.
Recent two recent studies on family concentration of sexually transmitted diseases and the spread of symptoms have led to the concentration of disease.
In contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients were also the main symptoms of heat (98%), dry cough (47%) and respiratory difficulties (55%).
But 80% of these patients need air support, far more than COVID-19 patients, which match MERS with a higher death rate than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and pain (21%) were observed among MERS patients.
Of SARS patients, heat (99%-100%), cough (29%-75%), respiratory difficulties (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and pain (13-25%) are the main symptoms, and about 14% to 20% of patients need air support.
As of February 14, the global confirmed COVID-19 cases reached 66,576 cases, with a mortality rate of 2 per cent.
In contrast, as of November 2002, SARS had a mortality rate of 10 per cent in 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.
An early study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 up to 6.47,95 per cent of the confidence zone (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 is only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 shows the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in symptoms, mortality and R0.
The above data show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher proliferation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but death is lower than the latter.
Therefore, controlling SARS-CoV-2 epidemics are more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Gathering sexually transmitted diseases usually occur in the same family, or from the same party or transport, such as cruise ships.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other epidemic areas in the last two weeks before the disease, or has a history of close contact with infected persons or patients.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and the cured patients who were discharged can carry the virus again, thereby sending an alarm for extended isolation.
The number of patients in the early stages of the disease is normal or reduced in the number of blood white cells (especially lymph cells).
For example, white cell count &lt; 4x109/L - including lymph cell count & lt; 1x109/L - 1x109/L - has been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, rising levels of amino acid transfer enzymes and viral blood disease.
Some patients can see the increase in liver enzymes and myoglobin levels in blood, and most patients can see blood C reaction protein and blood deposition.
Heavy patients can see a reduction in blood fibre protein degradation products D-diple levels and lymphoma cell count.
Most COVID-19 patients can see chest image anomalies, characterized by double-sided specs or lung grinding glass.
Patients usually have atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, liquid volume and fibrosis can seriously damage gas exchange.
The functional impairment of the I and type II lung bubbles reduces the level of activity agents and increases surface tension, thereby reducing lung expansion capacity and increases the risk of lung collapse.
So, the worst chest image discovery usually occurs at the same time as the most serious extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathology analysis of COVID-19 discovered the fall of lung bubble skin cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, transparent membrane formation, inter-mass lymphoma cell immersion and multi-nuclear cell cells, consistent with viral infections and ARDS pathology performance, and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
Testing SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse the polymer enzyme chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, since the higher false negative rate may accelerate the epidemic, China began to diagnose clinical performance on February 13, 2020 (and no longer relying on RT-PCR).
Similar situations occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, combined with medical history, clinical performance, laboratory inspection and image results are essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Zhang Feng team reported a synthetic SARS-CoV-2 clip using SHERLONK technology based on CRISP, which uses a test paper to detect concentrations of only 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (copy of 10-18 mol/L (copy of 10-100 viruses per microlitre 10-100 virus).
If validated in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly increase the sensitivity and convenience of diagnosis.
With the lack of experience in treating new CoVs, doctors support treatment mainly for COVID-19 patients while trying to use or propose various treatments for other CoVs - such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV - and other viral diseases (table2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments, such as anti-virus drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support for recovered patients.
Even suggested that the plasma of the recovered patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing for antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks on lungs at the beginning and may also express other organs of ACE2 at a lower level of attack, such as gastrointestinal systems and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory disorders and failure are the main threat to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and saving lives, including conventional oxygen, high flow oxygen, no gas and mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be supported by the ECMO, an improved CPR road technology for life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of relay infections and septic shock and protection of critical organ functions are essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
As you know, the immune system of SARS and MERS patients can cause cell factor storms.
Cell factor storms are a form of a whole body inflammation reaction characterized by the release of a series of cell factors, including TNF alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFN alpha, IFN beta, IFNgamma and MCP-1.
These cell factors induce immune cells to release a large number of free foundations, which is the main reason for ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunization inhibition is essential in the treatment of cell factor storms, especially among patients with severe illness.
Leather steroids and beads mono-resistant -- an anti-IL6 monoclon antibodies -- has been used to treat cell factor storms.
Other immunosistence therapy for cell factor storms includes: regulation of T-cell orientation immune responses; blocking IFN-gamma, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; Bona Tumpone resistance; cell factor signal transfer inhibitor 4; and HDAC inhibitor.
steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants to treat SARS to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
But large doses of steroids do not benefit from severe lung damage to SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they may cause serious side effects, especially blood deficiency bone deaths, which have a serious impact.
Nevertheless, short-range treatment is recommended for careful use of low- and medium- and low-dose cortex steroids for severe illness COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, there was no effective anti-virus therapy.
However, Redsywe, a nucleic acid similar, has been found to be effective for a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Redsywe is a new type of anti-virus drug developed by Gilid, originally used to treat diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburg virus.
Later, it proved that Redside could inhibit other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gilid has provided the drug to China for two clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons, which are promising.
In addition, the use of Barricktini, alpha-interference, Lopinawe/Litonawe and Libavilin is recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
There may be diarrhoea, disgusting, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects after the joint treatment of Lopinawe/Litonawe.
The interaction between these treatments and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Blood and antibodies generation of recovered patients
Patients recovering from infectious diseases have a long history of blood used to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect health individuals from infection.
In fact, recovered patients usually contain relatively high levels of antibodies for pathogens in their blood.
Antibodys are produced by B lymphoma cells for an immunoglobin (Ig) that can identify unique molecules in pathogens and directly and directly.
Based on this principle, plasma was collected from a group of recovered COVID-19 patients, and then injected it to 10 critical patients.
Their symptoms have improved within 24 hours, while finding reduced inflammation and virus loads and increased blood oxygen saturation.
However, before the development of specific therapy, it is necessary to verify and clarify to propose methods that can be used on a large scale.
In addition, given the effects of the treatment, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune reactions and cause cell factors to release syndromes, which may endanger life.
Antibody concentrations in blood are usually low, while plasma needs for patients at risk are high.
It's hard enough to develop and produce specific antibodies to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, the more critical and practical approach is to separate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic passwords for effective antibodies, or to screen effective antibodies for proteins necessary for the virus.
So we can easily expand the production of antibodies.
In China, the use of TCM has been treating multiple diseases for thousands of years.
However, its treatment effects depend largely on the combination of multiple components in the prescription, while prescriptions vary according to the TCM theory.
Most of the active ingredients are still unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their best combination.
Currently, as the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from the severe stage.
For example, wind-deficient capsules and co-facilit capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.
In several provinces of China, 87% of patients use TCM treatment, which observed the highest healing rate for COVID-19 patients, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50 per cent), while Hubei province uses TCM treatment at only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, with the lowest healing rate (13).
However, this is just a rough comparison, because many other factors of impact should also include in the assessment, such as the number and severity of patients.
On February 18, 2020, Zhang Burly and his colleagues published a study of the combined treatment of the WM and TCM alone.
They found that WM+TCM group temperature recovery, symptoms disappear and hospital time are significantly shorter than the simple WM group.
Most impressively, the symptoms of the WM+TCM group (from light to heavy) are significantly below the simple WM group (7.4% against 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group is also below the simple WM group (8.8% to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still require higher quality control tests, larger and more centres to confirm.
The mechanism of the TCM treatment or combination of the role of the TCM treatment and, where possible, clarifying its effective ingredients will also be of interest.
Most of the patients suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 cause great fear because of this highly contagious or even death disease, and the isolated people feel bitter, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as heat, oxygen deficiency and cough, and adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by cortex steroids, may increase anxiety and psychological distress.
A series of psychological reactions were reported at the early stages of the SARS outbreak, including continuous depression, anxiety, terror, mental excitement, mental illness, paranoia and even suicide.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contacter tracking and isolation makes people more anxious and guilty about the impact of infection, isolation and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams to avoid close contact using professional electronic equipment and applications through regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment programmes.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain from animal host and infected patients to vulnerable owners and usually as a complement to anti-virus treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Industry has worked to develop S-based vaccines to generate long-term and effective neutral antibodies and/or protective immunization for SARS-CoV.
The drug-reducing vaccine has been evaluated in SARS animal models.
However, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the body of the elderly and death attack models and their protection of the virus infection of human animals had not been identified before the start of clinical research.
It's probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, the continued presence of MERS and consociated diseases in the Middle East, as a result of the persistence of human and livestock in the epidemic, and spread to other regions.
Through the use of active viruses, DNA particles, viral carriers, nanoparticles, virus sample particles and reorganised protein subkis, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of safe and effective vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunisation individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the current epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this difficulty due to the long term (average 18 months) and the dynamic changes in CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 just started showing its complete clinical process among thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover, without any illness.
But, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has a high incidence and mortality rate.
Therefore, the establishment of pre-models of this disease is essential for health care institutions to identify services priorities, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect the pre-emergence of COVID-19 patients (table33):
Age: Age is the most important factor affecting SARS, and so is COVID-19.
As noted earlier, in a study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7% were over 50 years of age.
Patients in need of intensive care are more likely to have basic complications and complications and are significantly older than those who do not require intensive care (a medium age 66 to 51 years), suggesting that age is a pre-factor for the end of the COVID-19 patient.
Gender: As mentioned earlier, more men infected with SARS-CoV-2 are more than women (0.31/10 million pairs 0.27/10 million).
Merge and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to have acute heart damage and heart disorders.
Heart incident is also the main cause of SARS patients' death.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be combined with ACE2 positive cholesterol cells, which could lead to liver anomalies for COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age is closely linked to basic diseases and may affect each other.
Laboratory results are abnormal: C reaction protein (CRP) levels in blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage, which are considered disease, therapeutic reactions and potential post-recovering factors for final recovery.
It was also suggested that the CRP level and the extent of COVID-19 and the pre-pre-emptive relevance.
In addition, the increase of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the AST, the Acetamine Amino-Transferase (ALT) and the CK rise may also help predict the ending.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver and released during tissue damage.
So they're traditional signs of heart or liver functional disorders.
Main clinical symptoms: time progress in chest image examinations and clinical symptoms should be considered with other issues to predict the end and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned earlier, steroids are immunosuppressants and are usually used as auxiliary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
As large doses of cortex steroids are widely used for heavy SARS patients, many survivors suffer from haemorrhage bone deaths, leading to lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used in small doses and short times in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients were under great pressure because they often suffered long-term isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the deaths of relatives and sick friends.
Psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients out of stress and restore normal lives.
According to demographic studies to date, the epidemiology characteristics of COVID-19 seem to be different from SARS.
In addition to copying in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild symptoms or symptoms at the early stages of the infection, which is similar to other CoVs causing a normal cold.
As a result, the infected person produces a large number of viruses in the early or insurgency during the daily activity, causing great difficulties in the control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV's transmission is considered to occur when the patient's condition is severe, and most of them do not occur in the early stages.
So, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than SARS.
China is currently making great efforts, including the blockade of Wuhan and surrounding cities, as well as continuous isolation of almost all populations, with a view to interrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have caused serious damage to China ' s economic and other aspects, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the pace of development is slowing down.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March, and the decline phase will last 3-4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimate that COVID-19 is clearly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. has established a model of predicting the consequences of the epidemic, which believes that SARS-CoV-2 could be infected with two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that patients who recovered and discharged two weeks ago detected SARS-CoV-2 in the middle nose armor and swallowing, indicating that this newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to influenza.
But as the number of new cases decreased, China has shown encouraging signs that the current strategy may have worked.
Ebola virus was predicted to cause 1 million cases and killed 500,000 people.
But through strict isolation, the disease is finally controlled.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can weaken, eventually disappear or become less sick virus living with the human body.
The COVID-19 epidemic is provided with SARS and MERS (figure (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted through coughing or sneeze, even by direct exposure to items contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also discovered in faeces, thereby increasing the possibility of spreading excreta.
A recent study, including 138 cases, 41% of cases may have been caused by in-house infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Therefore, more rigorous precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially medical personnel, social workers, family members, colleagues, even bystanders who have had contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 dust masks (the 1860s series) helps to control the transmission of the virus.
Surgery masks prevent drippings from potential infected persons from spreading or adhesive to the surface of items that may be passed to others.
However, only N95 (1860s series) masks can prevent inhalation of viruses up to 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virus fully penetrated; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV, all of which are about 85 nm.
Because the virus particles can even penetrate five stacked surgical masks, medical personnel who are directly exposed to patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should wear quarantine suits to further reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 with N95 masks; the virus may have entered its body through inflammation eyes.
Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent masks or goggles when facing patients.
For public areas affected by the epidemic or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that everyone use disinfect soap to wash hands more frequently than usual, remain in the interior self-separation and limit contact with potential infected persons.
Three feet are considered to stay away from the patient's appropriate distance.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent virus transmission.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus that broke into the human world, based on deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which was reported on January 7, 2020 with SARS-CoV should have been highly alert to China.
But until January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan City Center for Disease Prevention and Control was still calming the citizens, indicating that the new virus was not contagious and the possibility of people is limited and the epidemic is manageable.
This news clearly relaxed public vigilance and the spring festival is coming, and it's just missed to contain the epidemic at the key node of Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may learn from this pain and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should (1) be more cautious in publishing announcements, as each word is essential to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive information from hospitals rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) to control potential epidemics in the early days rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more frequently targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic and regularly test and improve social response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, it had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world in less than two months.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 looks like SARS re-emerging.
But there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
There are more older persons affected by COVID-19 than young people, more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate of older patients are higher than young patients.
SARS mortality rate is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% against 1.44%).
Even without symptoms, COVID-19 patients still spread the virus, and SARS patients usually spread the virus when they are sick, which leads to control COVID-19 transmission much more difficult than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and broader than SARS-CoV.
Of some COVID-19 patients, the regular RNA test results of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.
On the other hand, the cured patients may turn again.
These findings greatly increase the risk of virus transmission.
Considering the rapid study on COVID-19, the following key issues remain to be addressed:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homogens were found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS samples, we still cannot draw the conclusions of SARS-CoV-2 from bats.
Which animal is spreading the virus from the original host -- assuming bats -- to the middle host of mankind?
If we don't know the answers to questions 1 and 2, we can't effectively cut off the transmission and the outbreak can be re-emerged at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical analysis have proven that SARS-CoV-2 is combined with ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the gas cells and cause subsequent pathology changes?
Will the virus also combine the cells of ACE2 in other organs?
If these questions have no clear answers, we cannot achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in the human being?
Will it become a global pandemic? Will it disappear like SARS? Or will it be re-emerging like influenza?
Finding answers to the above and many other questions is essential, but it may take longer.
However, however, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normal.
The origin of the human coronary virus.
For thousands of years, mutation and adaptation have contributed to the common evolution of Coronaviruses, CoV and its host, including humans.
Before 2003, two types of coronary viruses (HCOV) were known to cause minor diseases, such as common colds.
The outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) have turned the situation, revealing the destructive and fatality of HCOV infection.
SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in central China at the end of 2019, made CoV the focus of attention again, and it was surprising that it was highly contagious, but less sick than its sister virus SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a common human animal disease, so it will help us to understand the origin of HCoV's human co-prong disease.
Most HCoVs are from bats and are non-pathetic.
Some of the intermediate storage hosts of HCoV are known.
Identification of animal hosts is of direct significance for the prevention of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of the CoV host in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of human CoV.
In this overview, we outlined the existing knowledge of seven HCOVs, highlighting their discovery history, the origin of the disease and the spread of the disease.
It's important that we compare and compare different HCoVs from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and genome restructuring.
Against this background, we explored the current outbreak of the 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, this paper highlights the requirements for successful completion of host conversion and the impact of the evolution of the virus on disease.
CoV belongs to the coronary virus section, consisting of a single chain of justice with a membrane.
These viruses have the largest genome of the RNA virus, containing 2.6 to 32,000 alkalis, known as CoV, because of coronary form under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoV has a non-section genome that shares similar organizations.
About two thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab copying enzymes.
These polypolymers are further processed, producing 16 non-structured proteins called nsp1-16.
The rest of the genome contains structural protein ORF, including stinging (S), membrane (E), film (M) and nuclear protein (N).
Many spectrum-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by the different spectrum of CoV.
According to the difference in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four parts (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and thal-CoV), of which beta-CoV contains most HCoVs and divided into four spectrometers (A, B, C and D).
System development evidence shows that bats and rodents are genetic sources of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main host of gamma-CoV and thorium-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has been crossing species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.
So far, seven infected people have known coronary viruses (HCOV).
Of which HCOV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Other 5 beta-CoVs include HCOV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronary virus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause minor symptoms such as common colds and/or diarrhoea.
By contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly sick, leading to severe lower respiratory infections among relatively more patients and are more likely to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute Respiratory Distors Schandrome, ARDS) and extra lung performance.
In the mid-60s, the first HCoV-229E virus plant B814 was separated from the nose cavity of a normal cold patient.
Since then, humans have accumulated more knowledge through extensive research on the HCOV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that can cause self-restrictive symptoms.
In fact, before SARS outbreak, the concept of infection HCoV is usually a harmless concept that is widely accepted.
SARS, which broke out in 2003, was one of the most destructive events in history, with more than 8,000 infections, with a rough death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian peninsula and spread to the rest of the world.
2019 New HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is a pathogen for the ongoing 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), which had been taken over 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing, and the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven types of HCoVs have the origin of human animals from bats, rats or domestic animals.
A variety of evidence shows that all HCoV evolutions are derived from bats, and the virus in bats is highly adaptable, without disease, but shows great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has brought enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
The origin of tracking HCoV's human and animal disease provides a framework for understanding the natural history of the leap of virus species, drivers and constraints.
In addition, this will guide or promote the search for SARS-CoV-2 storage host, middle host and expanding animal host, which is important for preventing future virus spills.
In this overview, we outlined the origin of HCoV's disease, inter-planting and morbidity mechanisms.
In particular, we stress and explore a common topic that HCoV's pro-generation virus is not usually sick among their natural storage hosts, but is sick after trans-species spread to Shinjuku.
In addition, we have recalled the trend towards the evolution of HCoV, where the increase in communication is often accompanied by the decline in disease.
Against this background, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Since the late 1930s, the animal CoV has been widely known.
Before the first time the HCoV-229E strain B814 was separated from the nose cavity of a common cold patient, medicalists had separated different coVs from infected animals (including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs).
In the last few decades, seven types of HCOVs have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in time (table 1) will provide us with a wealth of information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCOV-229E strain was separated from the respiratory tract of the upper respiratory infection and then adapted to growth in the WI-38 lung cell strain.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have headaches, sneezes, discomfort, throat pains, 10-20 percent of patients with fever, coughing, etc.
In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the organ culture of the mammoth brain and subsequent continuous generations.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to HCoV-229E infections, and are not very different from symptoms compared to other respiratory pathogens (e.g. influenza A and nose virus).
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, mainly in winters of moderate climates.
Usually, the two viruses have less than a week, and then about two weeks.
A human volunteer study shows that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E have light colds.
Only a few patients with low immune function show serious lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first highly recorded pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, which is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV.
The first SARS case dates back to Guangdong Province, China, late 2002.
The SARS epidemic caused 8,096 reported cases, 774 deaths and spread to many countries and continents.
In addition to super-dispersors, it is estimated that each case may cause about two repeat cases, with a peak of virus load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected SARS-CoV were initially expressed as muscle pains, headaches, heat, discomfort and cold fighting, followed by respiratory difficulties, coughing and respiratory distress.
The reduction in lymphoma cells, liver function check anomalies and the rise of myo acid enzymes are common laboratory tests anomalies in SARS.
In addition, among SARS patients, the increase in the growth of the upper skin cell and the increase in the gravy cells are observed.
Then about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
Among these serious patients, multiple organs, including gastrointestinal tracts, liver and kidneys, may also be infected and usually accompanied by cell factor storms, which may be fatal among patients with low immune functions.
The virus was first separated from an open lung test for a relative from a source patient from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been working on HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially found to be popular among young children, older persons and immuno-deficiency patients with respiratory diseases.
In the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, there are common nasal inflammation, meningitis, heat and fine bronchitis.
Another independent study shows that the same virus was separated from the nose cavity specimen of a eight-month boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was discovered in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with a peak of disease at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to blocking laxitis (also known as Grub sex throatitis).
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to community access to pneumonia and fine bronchitis, there are reports of HCoV-HKU1 related to acute asthma attacks.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide to cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four communities have acquired HCoVs are well adapted to humans and are usually unlikely to cause high-pathetic diseases. But there are accidents, and for unknown reasons, such as a more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63, and recently reported that the sub-type caused serious lower respiratory infections in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to communicate and survive effectively in humans, their toxicity or disease is reduced.
MERS-CoV was first separated from the lungs of a 60-year-old acute pneumonia and kidney failure patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases come from the Middle East, input cases were reported in countries of Europe and Tunisia, which occasionally transmitted to close contacts.
In 2015, sexual transmission was re-emerged in Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical performance of MERS is similar to SARS, characterized by gradual acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have had acute kidney failure, a unique feature of MERS in diseases caused by HCoV so far.
Over 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases, with a death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
In mid-December 2019, a concentration of pneumonia was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and a retrospective analysis confirmed to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization announced that the continuing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 was an international concern for public health and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were diagnosed globally, with a rough death rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2 per cent, compared to 1.2% outside Hubei.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause serious respiratory infections, expressed as heat, cough and breathing difficulties.
Some patients have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms, which can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of 82% of high nucleic acid sequences, they gather into different branches in system development trees.
SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less sick than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more contagious.
There are reported that SARS-CoV-2 infected persons may accelerate the rapid spread of the virus around the world.
Compare SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCOVs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the period of the HCoV disease and the duration of the disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trends of six HCOVs.
Second, the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and 4 community acquisition HCoV (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are more common in community acquisition of HCoV infections, including non-specific, light or even symptoms.
On the other hand, a small number of serious COVID-19 cases are also seen in SARS-CoV cases, although the proportion is slightly low.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting pattern features of community acquisition HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as community access to HCoV.
On the other hand, whether SARS-CoV-2 spreads, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, will remain to be verified after human generation.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in septic samples.
At least in some cases, whether SARS-CoV-2 septic-mouth transmission plays an important role as in SARS-CoV and remains to be clarified in future studies.
Also, it is important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community acquisition HCoV.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, disease and continuous transmission will have an important impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All four communities that cause minor symptoms, HCoV, have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, humans have adapted to these four types of HCoV.
In other words, both sides could be survivors of the ancient HCoV epidemic.
The HCoV and those who cause serious human diseases and those with severe HCOV diseases have died.
To this end, HCoV must be replicated enough in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations, thus counter host limit factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the more the infection, the greater the possibility it fully adapts to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop it by isolation or other infection control measures.
For years, these four communities have been spread across the population, leading to normal immune problems with common colds.
These viruses don't need animal hosts.
By contrast, the highly sick SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and cannot continue to spread in humans.
They need to live and reproduce among the host of human animals and may find opportunities to spread infected human targets through one or more middle hosts and extended hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 community acquisition HCoV.
It's as contagious as community acquisition HCoV, at least for now.
But it's more sick than community access to HCoV, less sick than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It can be fully adapted to humans and is still to be observed in the process of circulation within humans without host or middle animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, we have some guidance on the evolutionary host of HCoV, natural host, storage host, middle host and expansion of host definitions and features.
If an animal has a closely associated ancestors with a high equivalent source at the nucleic acid sequence level, the animal will be the evolutionary host of HCoV.
The ancestors' virus is usually adaptable and not sick among this host.
Likewise, the host will carry HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its pro-generation virus.
By contrast, if HCoV was born in the middle host soon or immediately, it would not be able to adapt well to the Shinjuku and usually sick.
This host can act as a source of human infection and a source of disease by allowing the virus to be replicated briefly and then spread it to humans to expand the host ' s role.
If HCoV cannot maintain its transmission within the host, there may be terminal infections.
Instead, HCoV can adapt to middle host, even long-term locality.
In this case, the host became the natural host.
Epidemiology data review analysis found that SARS index cases have a history of contact with hunting animals.
The subsequent serum positive survey showed that the level of immunoglobin G (IgG) in animal dealers against SARS-CoV is higher than the general population.
In the living animal market, fruit beavers and a beaver cat were first found to carry almost exactly the SARS-CoV virus.
After removing all the fruit beavers in the market, there is no further SARS report, which indirectly supports the above view.
However, the report states that farm fruit beavers of wild or uncontact to the living animal market are basically negative for SARS-CoV, which suggests that the fruit beaver may be just a middle magnification host, not a natural host of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, many small mammals can also be used as a possibility of expanding host between SARS-CoV.
All these animals seem to be the terminal host of SARS-CoV.
A study of SARS-CoV natural animal host discovered a closely related bat coronary virus known as HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which survived the Chinese ass.
These bats are positive for the genome sequence of SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bat coronary viruses and SARS-CoV have 88-92% nucleic acid sequences.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept of bats as the host of the emerging human pathogens.
In addition, researchers identified a variety of SARS coronary viruses (SL-CoV) from bats, but no virus can be separated as a live virus, except for a designated WIV1.
Human blood vessels conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the known receptor of SARS-CoV.
The experiment proved that WIV1 extracted from bat shit samples uses bats, fruit beavers and human ACE2 as the receptor of their entry cells.
Interestingly, SARS recovery patients have a serum and WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestors to bat SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleic acid sequence co-sourced.
Although the two viruses are highly identical, WIV1 is not a direct pro-generation virus for SARS-CoV, and bats are not direct storage hosts of SARS-CoV.
System development analysis brings MERS-CoV to bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5 as the same group.
Bats CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor diplylase 4 (DPP4) to invade the virus.
The RNA dependency RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is closer to RNA in the system to the equivalent of bat beta-CoV from Europe and Africa.
So far, MERS-CoV has not been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its near-parent bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% of nucleic acid sequences.
So bats may not be the direct storage host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the Middle East shows that single-peak camels are positive to the serum of the MERS-CoV specific and antibodies, just like camels from several African countries that originated in the Middle East.
MERS-CoV is the same as the virus found by the human body, which further shows that camels are the real storage host of MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that in the camels that are experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, general symptoms are minor, but a large number of viruses are observed.
It is worth noting that infected camels are transmitted not only through respiratory tracts, but also through excreta, but also the septic route is the main way to spread the bat virus.
However, the problem remains, as many MERS confirmed cases do not have a history of contact with camels before symptoms occur, which may be attributed to human or unknown transmission, including unrecognized animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 and the bat separated from the middle ass.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too much to determine pro-generation relationships.
In other words, unless almost the same bat coronary virus is found in the future, bats may not be the direct storage host of SARS-CoV-2.
It is assumed that the middle animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should be sold and slaughtered in the South China seafood wholesale market, many of the initial COVID-19 cases associated with them, which suggests that there may be an animal-to-human transmission.
Recent studies based on macro genome sequencing show that a endangered small mammal called mountain armor (Malai piercing) may also carry ancestors associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new mountain coronary virus genomes and SARS-CoV-2 have 85-92% nucleic acid sequences.
But they're equally close to RatG13, with about 90% of the same source at the nucleic acid sequence level.
In system development trees, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 sub-systems, one of which has a more similar receptor (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4 per cent of amino acid sequences.
In contrast, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RTTG13 is greater, although the sequence of the whole genome is higher.
An earlier study of disease piercing also reported that the virus overlap was detected from lung samples, which had similar relationships with SARS-CoV-2.
The study uses different assembly methods and manual processing, and has received about 86.3% of the entire genome sequence of the virus.
We can't rule out the possibility of a mountain armor that is one of the middle animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, as SARS-CoV-2 varies from the beta-CoV sequence associated with the mountain armor SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from mountain armor.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 associated with SARS-CoV-2 associated with the mountain armor SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 evolution paths in bats, mountain armor and other mammals remain to be determined.
Although the highest sequence cogenity was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and mountain armor, SARS-CoV-2 associated beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 have the highest full genome sequence cogenity.
It can be highly assumed that the high similarities between beta-CoV and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 are caused by the evolution of the selective community.
Another opposite view is that the beta-CoV associated with the mountain armor SARS-CoV-2 was reorganized in the third wildlife species.
As a driving force of evolution, reorganization is widely present in beta-CoV.
With regard to the origin of the direct human and animal co-treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet settled.
In addition to the high-age HCoV, researchers have studied the origin of human animals and animals of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.
System development evidence shows that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may all originated in bat coronary viruses, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 pro-generation viruses have been found in rodents.
The report states that the bat coronary virus found in the three-coloured bats in North America, known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge Cove) shows closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has genetic links to another bat coronary virus (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008), and camel animals are suspected of being host.
For the sake of clarity, figures 1 and Table 2 summarizes existing knowledge of the origin of the animal known HCoV.
System development analysis provides evidence of inter-house transmission events in history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from animals, there was a pandemic of respiratory infectious diseases.
The history of the spread of HCoV-229E is unknown.
Bat alpha-CoV, closely related to HCoV-229E, has been discovered.
There's a camel between the two.
There's a lot of evidence that supports the virus that spreads directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not camels, may be exposed to bats in a common ecological position.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with camels.
Second, bat alpha-CoV, associated with HCoV-229E, has diversity and non-infection in bats, while camel alpha-CoV causes respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, no camels were found in wildlife.
Therefore, camels cannot be excluded from humans to obtain HCoV-229E-CoV associated alpha-CoV.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human disease, including rabies, Ebola, Nipa and Hendra.
So it's not surprising that bats spread HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Or, although bat alpha-CoV acts as a gene bank for HCoV-229E, camels and single camels may be the middle host that spread the virus to humans, which is exactly the same as the MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a very good example of the spread from bats to single-peak camels and from single camels to humans.
The evolution of the bat MERS-CoV was known in its initial identification, and the subsequent discovery reinforced this argument.
Apparently, bats provide a rich library of viruses for the exchange and inter-species of genetic footage.
Long-lived and dense groups, close social interaction and strong flight capabilities are the advantages of bats to become ideal "virus communicators".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the single camel for decades.
It's well adapted to these camels, and camels have moved from the middle host to a stable natural storage host.
MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintain relatively low mutation rates.
It's an accident to spread the stars of mankind, and because it cannot continue to spread, humans remain the terminal host of MERS-CoV.
The role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission is different than the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission (if any).
Especially, the armored beta-CoV is highly sick in the armor.
They may be the terminal host of the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV, similar to the fruit beaver in SARS-CoV.
Future studies must determine or exclude several possibilities for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats may be the host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share ecological positions with bats through slaughtering or coal mining.
Second, the armor may be one of the middle of the new invasion of SARS-CoV-2.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and eating wild taste.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
There's a need to investigate livestock and wildlife.
Third, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 may be reorganized and adapted in the third species that have been exposed to bats and mountain armor.
Research on the origin of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal host, three main factors in the virus play an important role in promoting coronary viruses across inter-species.
First, they have a higher mutation rate in RNA reproduction.
The mutation rate of the coronary virus is estimated to be "medium" to "high" compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, and the average replacement rate per year is about 10-4 times, depending on the adaptation phase of the coronary virus to Shinjuku.
The coronary virus has a proof-to-active nucleic acid external cut enzyme, which can cause very high variability and decay, and cannot even survive.
Interestingly, the known nucleotide Remdesivir can inhibit the reproduction of the coronary virus by inhibiting this nucleic nucleic acid external cut enzyme and RNA dependency RNA polymerase.
Redsyway is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs that are about to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of the coronary virus is about 1 million times higher than its host.
Besides, if the coronary virus is not well adapted to the host, the mutation rate is usually high.
SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower mutation rate than a high mutation rate, indicating that it is more adaptable to humans.
It's assumed that it's adapted to another host near humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies to the MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single camels.
In theory, genetic drifting is likely to rapidly fail vaccines and anti-virus drugs for SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger RNA genome in the coronary virus has additional plasticity in genetic mutation and reorganization, thereby increasing the possibility of inter-synthetic evolution, which is conducive to the emergence of a new coronary virus when the conditions are appropriate.
The vast number of unique open reading frames and protein functions coded to the genome 3' provides evidence for this.
Third, the coronary virus is randomly and frequently switched templates through a unique "replicate selection" mechanism during RNA reproduction.
Among the host of the mixed container, the CoV RNA transfer will occur frequently in chain exchange.
The height of the same source and the subgenomic RNA can reorganize the new coronary virus.
Evidence of the systematic development of natural reorganizations were found in animal coronary viruses such as HCoV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43 and bats such as HCOV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction related to transmission
In addition to the three above-mentioned virus factors, the interaction between the virus and host receptor is another key factor affecting the spread of the species.
This paper, a typical example of the reorganization of SARS-CoV, shows evidence of positive selection in inter-synthetic transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis of human and fruit beaver SARS-CoV separation strain, researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially through the mutation of S protein RBD.
Usually, the RBD in the coronary virus S protein interacts with the cell receptor and is screened by the host antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318 to 510 amino acids of the S1 segment, which combines the human ACE2 and its co-receptives to bring the virus into.
The RBD of SARS-CoV can identify the ACE2 receptor of animals, including bats, fruit beavers, rats and beaver cats, thereby spreading the virus between species.
In fact, only six amino acid residues were observed in RBD, four of which were located in a combination of receptor that interacted with the ACE2 receptor.
The RBD of the fruit beaver SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations, which may increase the ability to interact with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids could be essential to the virus to humans.
It's worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S-protein S1 units is 30%, which means that the combination of S protein with human ACE2 may change.
Indeed, a frozen mirror study shows that this combination is 10 to 20 times higher than the pro-relationship between ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It would also be meaningful to determine whether any other co-receptor is needed in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also combined with ACE2, but is combined with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as HCoV-229E aminoase N and 9-O-Acetyl acid of HCOV-OC43.
They may also explain the reasons why the coronary virus has successfully adapted to humans after spreading from animal host across species.
In addition to cell receptor, the results of HCoV transmission are influenced by other host dependence and restrictive factors.
The difference between these host proteins in humans and bats, single camels and rodents, such as HCoV, may constitute obstacles to inter-speech transmission.
HCOV must deprive host dependence and break host constraints to successfully spread.
In this regard, molecular determinants in the important area of the virus-host interaction remain to be determined and demonstrated.
Using the latest CRISP technology, the impartial full genome screening of SARS-CoV-2 hosts may yield results.
New HCoV appearance: Back to origin
The diversity of bat coronary viruses offers sufficient opportunities for the emergence of a new HCoV.
In that sense, the bat coronary virus acts as a gene bank for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic restructuring are drivers of the evolution of HCoV and two important steps of the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coded genes may completely change the pattern of the virus.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, it is considered important to adapt to humans because of the separation of SARS-CoV-related bat viruses, but found that they can encode different ORF8 proteins.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleic acid missing features of SARS-CoV were discovered in separate strains.
This missing divides ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation for host conversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have been reorganized with the alpha-and gamma-CoV spectrum, where a large number of smaller reorganization areas were found in RNA dependency RNA polymer enzymes.
In nsp9, most nsp10 and part nsp14 were also found.
Similarly, research has been shown that the epidemic of MERS-CoV has experienced restructuring between different spectrums, which occurred in Saudi Arabia's single camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the reorganization incident was observed in other HCOVs, where HCOV and other animal coronary viruses were reorganized in their non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection could cause unexpected changes in the virus genome, which is probably due to reducing the choice pressure imposed by the host immune system that the virus faces.
One example of these effects is that in the HCoV-229E prototype virus strain, the absence of double nucleic acid has led to a complete length of ORF4 missing.
Although the full ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, camel alpha-CoV shows individual nucleic acid insertions, causing a mutation of the migration.
Last but equally important, the evolution of the new HCoV is driven by the storage host's choice pressure.
After bats are infected with coronary viruses, no symptoms were detected or only minor symptoms, indicating adaptation between coronary viruses and bats.
From the point of view of anatomy and physiology, bats seem to be well adapted to the coronary virus.
For example, the defects in the activation of bats for inflammation effectively reduce the pathology caused by the coronary virus.
Moreover, the natural lethal cell activity of bats has been suppressed due to the positive regulation of NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the main tissue compatible complex I molecular expression, the natural lethal cell activity of bats is inhibited.
Moreover, high-level active oxygen (ROS) from high metabolic activity of bats can inhibit the reproduction of coronary viruses and can be corrected by nucleic sugar nucleic acid external acid, thus providing a highly sick pressure on the virus plant when entering Shinjuku.
More pathic coronary virus strains may also evolve by reorganizing, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics to adapt to host.
So, three new HCoVs have emerged in the last 20 years, not by chance.
The coronary virus does not cause minor symptoms among the host of bats and camels.
They're doing a lot of copies and they don't cause a strong host immune response.
That's why there are symptomsless carriers and serious cases of human infection.
The serious symptoms occur mainly because of the overactivity and cell factor storms of immune reactions, the more immune reaction, the more severe the lung damage.
By contrast, the immune reaction has been discoordinated from coronary virus reproduction among symptoms.
The same strategy to delink the immune response may have a positive role in anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The interference reaction in bats is particularly strong.
Therefore, at least at least at the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection should be useful.
Besides, the NLRP3 inflammation in bats is flawed.
Based on this reasoning, using MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammation may be useful for COVID-19 treatment.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general themes based on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although 95% of the bats with SARS-CoV have been found with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronary virus and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid equivalent to 96%.
Although fruit beavers and other animals in the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, the direct middle host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been determined.
It has been found that a significantly common source of mountain armor beta-CoV has been found, which suggests that the armor may be one of the middle hosts, or the piercing of beta-CoV may contribute genetic footage to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or unintentionally manufactured.
With the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the coronary virus has become a focus of attention.
The study of bats and other animals' coronary viruses has greatly changed our awareness of the origin of HCoV's disease and animal host in human transmission.
A lot of evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and spread to humans through middle host.
Given that SARS-CoV infections are derived from contact between humans and fruit beavers on the market, closing the wet market and killing beavers can effectively end SARS' epidemic.
Similarly, given the discovery of multiple spectroscopy systems that are closely linked to SARS-CoV-2, mountain armor should be removed from the wet market to prevent the spread of human animals.
But whether SARS-CoV-2 and how to spread to humans through mountain armor and other mammals, still to be studied further.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in a single camel for a long time.
These camels are important means of transport and the main source of local meat, milk, leather and fur products.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to follow the Chinese wildlife market to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and sacrifice all camels to control MERS.
To stop the re-emergence of MERS, integrated initiatives should be developed for camels to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, new genetic types may occur, and then cause an outbreak.
All kinds of human animals are living with coronary viruses flowing in wild environments.
Especially, the diversity of bat coronary viruses with the potential of human animals is highly diverse.
These animals share a lot of opportunities for evolution and reorganization, leading to the future more accessible and/or deadly new coronary viruses in humans.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wildlife should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
After the serious tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop better precautions and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have been on Earth for a long time.
They stay among their natural hosts until there is a spill.
Although bats have many features that are conducive to virus transmission, if people are educated to stay away from bats and other wild species, human access to bats and other wild species will be significantly reduced.
In order to better understand the ecological situation of the coronary virus and its natural host, there is a need for continuous monitoring of mammals, which will prove that it is very useful to prevent animal transmission to humans and future eruptions.
In short, the most effective way to prevent viral animals is that humans should stay away from the ecological position of the natural host of the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing in the mystery of the origin of the disease.
First, if bats spread an old SARS-CoV-2 virus to mountain armor, it makes sense to look at when bats and mountain armor can share the same ecological position.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, then how humans are exposed to bats to be determined.
Third, if the third mammal acts as a real host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and mountain armor.
Finally, as many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be conducted.
If it's bats, mountain armor or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or almost the same pro-generation virus will be found in the natural host in the future.
Continuing research in this field will reveal the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
There is a need to update the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 "Specific Cases" and "confirmated cases"
On February 6, 2020, our team released a guide to the diagnosis and treatment of new coronary viruses (2019-nCoV) infection, which we have provided experience and learning to the global response to the epidemic.
However, the 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease based on ongoing research and clinical experience, and our perception of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are being updated.
In this letter, we responded to an opinion on the above-mentioned guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "Specific Cases" and "confirmated cases" in accordance with the latest COVID-19 treatment programme issued by the National Health and Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronary virus (2019-nCoV) broke out, which is now officially named 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronary virus (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO (WHO) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick proposal guide and posted the guide online on February 06, 2020.
Since its release, it has attracted extensive attention.
But please note that COVID-19 is a new disease based on ongoing research and clinical experience, and our perception of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are being updated.
For example, the National Health and Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) published seven editions of the COVID-19 programme between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have changed in substance.
Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou and others who have proposed a simple rating based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guide and provides valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We agree with this important work they've done and thank you.
However, their proposals also need to be updated on the latest COVID-19 treatment programme (test 7th edition) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), suspected cases are required to combine an epidemiological historical characteristics with two clinical performance for a comprehensive analysis, and three clinical performances need to be met without a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in communities with COVID-19 cases reported in Wuhan City and in the surrounding areas of the city of Wuhan or in the surrounding areas of COVID-19; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 cases of infection (positive nucleic acid detection); (3) has a history of contact with patients with heat or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other reporting COVID-19 cases; (4) contact with cases of mass diagnosis (2 weeks before symptoms appear) 2 heat and/or respiratory symptoms, such as home, office, school class, etc.)
Clinical performance: (1) heat and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) image characteristics with COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or reduced number of white cells in early stages of morbidity, reduced lymph cell count.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases and any of the following pathogens or serum evidence: (1) real-time PCR detection positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the virus's whole genome sequence shows a high equivalent to known new coronary virus; (3) specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies positive in the serum test; or SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies from negative to positives, or drop 4 times more than acute periods in the recovery period.
As we can see, the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020) add real-time PCR nucleic acid testing in respiratory or blood specimens.
The fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) added blood specimen pathology tests; and then the seventh edition added serum evidence.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to study the best nucleic acid detection reagent boxes for rapid diagnosis and respiratory specimens, including blood extraction, which increases the availability of different specimens and provides evidence for the integration of positive results of specific antibodies into the diagnostic criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of atypical symptoms and symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou and others should be updated because they classified people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
In addition, the rating system needs to be validated in further clinical practices and studies.
Finally, we want more direct evidence and call on readers to comment.
For diagnosis of suspected cases and confirmed cases, we suggest that we refer to and follow the latest guidelines in the country where the case is located.
Our team will also update our guidelines in time to help.
Bangladesh reported 5 new COVID-19 deaths, with a single-day high
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths on that day.
This has created a new number of single-day deaths from the virus.
As of yesterday, the number of cases reported by the Bangladesh Epidemiology, Disease Control and Disease Control and Research Institute (IEDCR), 114 confirmed cases and 33 cases were cured after home rest.
17 cumulative deaths.
At the online press conference, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, head of IEDCR, stated that these deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years of age, 2 of them between 51-60 years and one of them between 41-50.
She also said that two of them died came from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a global massive epidemic (pandemi).
A hospital officer revealed to the local news media Anadolu Agency that one of the deaths was Jalal Saifur Rahman, Director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridge of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, announced online video that public transport would be suspended beyond the original plan and extended until this Saturday.
The public transport was suspended on March 26th and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Basic materials such as medical, fuel and food are still normally transported.
On 8 March, of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh, two returned from Italy and one of the other was the wife of one of the confirmed patients.
By March 19, all three patients had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than millions of infections worldwide
According to John Hopkins University data, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronary virus infections worldwide exceeded 1 million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 deaths are related to diseases caused by coronary viruses - COVID-19.
On the same day of the milestone, Malawi confirmed the country ' s first coronary virus infection, and the first death case in Zambia was associated with the coronary virus.
North Korea claims that by Thursday, the country was one of the few countries without coronary virus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization had reported 1051635 confirmed cases, including 79332 cases within 24 hours of central European time on 4 April (0800 UTC).
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronary viruses have been recorded, killing at least 5,900 people.
CBS News quoted John Hopkins University data reports that on Wednesday, coronary virus infections killed more than 1,000 people in the United States.
All over the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of diseases.
Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the closure date until May 1.
President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would continue to be paid throughout the country during the suspension of work until April 30th.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes to 10 abstentions and 1 objection.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in Mecca and Medina to a full-day curfew; before, curfew was valid between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose curfew between 10 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the residence order until May 1.
Australian stores have reduced the maximum number of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian chains, Woolworths and Coles, have reduced the maximum purchase of toilet paper for all stores nationwide to two bags and one package.
ALDI also launched a limited package on Monday.
These restrictions are posted in the form of messages on the cashier or posted on the Facebook page of the chain.
Reports say that buyers hoard goods for fear of COVID-19 in case they need self-separation.
Wednesday, Woolworth also limited the number of toilet paper purchases to each single package.
Before these changes, Woolworths and Coles launched a limit of four packages per transaction on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles reported in its March 8 press release that, after implementing the restrictions on four packages, "Many shops are still sold out within an hour of arrival" and called the demand "unprecedented," while ALDI called it "unexpected" in Tuesday's Facebook post.
According to a Woolworth spokesman, last week's sales were "a sharp increase".
Last week, Costco's store in Canberra will also limit the number to two packages.
To further mitigate the shortage, Coles ordered greater packaging to suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, and Woolworth ordered additional stocks, while ALDI prepared inventory for planned Wednesdays.
According to Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retail Association, retailers tried to increase their inventory, but the local council's restrictions on truck delivery made it difficult.
He expects that as suppliers try to meet demand, production costs will rise, while preferential activities will be reduced.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that after early release of inventory, some shops would not be able to hold a Wednesday preferential event.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the University of Technology in Queensland, said that the store was supplemented every night.
He said that toilet paper was a large item, so the stock was smaller and that, once it was sold out, it would leave a huge shelf space that exacerbates the lack of supplies.
"Coles and Woolworths are that if there are many things on the shelf, goods like roller paper and handwashing can [buy] and in sufficient quantities, you may not be so scared. " Russell Zimmerman said to ABC News.
The regenerative toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap last Wednesday said they had no stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures suffy toilet paper and Solaris Paper, who make Sorbent toilet paper, stressed that they were working all day long, weekends to ensure supply.
The real estate website Domain.com reported that the number of auctions held by buyers on weekends on the weekend of labour, some real estate dealers will provide free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction in Melbourne.
NT News is a daily newspaper printed in Darwin City, which contains eight pages of plugs in the Thursday newspaper, which is designed to be used as toilet paper after cutting.
According to ABC Australia on March 3, the store was initially reluctant to impose restricted purchases, and they said they had no plans to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other goods were also in high demand, including masks, handwashing fluids, dry goods, handwashing fluids and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, Ocado, the British online supermarket limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packages on Sunday night, 12 volumes per package.
World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the continued outbreak of COVID-19 (diseases caused by the coronary virus SARS-CoV-2) were a major epidemic.
Although the term "large epidemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, not the risk of a particular case, WHO noted the need to urge the Government to take measures:
"All countries/regions can still change the process of this pandemic ...
If the country/regions test, test, treatment, isolation, tracking and mobilization as a response, "Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO, said.
"We are deeply concerned about the alarming extent of proliferation and gravity and the alarming extent of inaction ... "
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the epidemic was "emptive."
He commented in CNN in February that "No respiratory virus has been found to spread globally after the emergence of influenza."
Ghebreyesus expressed similar views and said, "We've never seen the big epidemic that coronary virus has triggered before."
He went on to say, "Well, we've never seen a controlled virus epidemic before."
Before entering the popular new state, WHO identified this outbreak of public health incidents of international concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said, "The most importantly, it's still deteriorating."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
2019-2020 The coronary virus epidemic is a continuous spread of 2019 new coronary virus diseases (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
This outbreak was confirmed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and was identified as an epidemic on January 30, 2020 as an international concern.
As of 10 April 2020, 210 countries and territories worldwide reported about 16.1 million COVID-19 cases, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
The cure is about 36.4 million.
China has a rate of about 4 per cent, while the global rate of death is between 0.08% (New Zealand) and 13.04 per cent (Algeria).
Common symptoms include heat, cough and air.
And it could be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The insulation period from exposure to the disease is 2-14 days, usually about 5 days.
There is no vaccine or special effects anti-virus treatment.
Clinical treatment is dominated by disease support treatment. Recommended preventive measures include handwashing, covering mouths while coughing, maintaining safe distance from others, monitoring of suspected infected persons and self-separation.
Official agencies have taken travel restrictions, isolation, curfew, workplace hazard control and facility closure.
The epidemic has led to a serious impact on the global socio-economic crisis, with the delay or cancellation of sports, religion, political and cultural activities, while panic shopping has exacerbated a wide range of supply shortages.
Some 99.4 per cent of primary and secondary school students in primary and secondary schools are affected by 193 countries and regions worldwide.
As a result of the spread of false virus information online, xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asian-East Asian-East Asian-East Asian-East Asian-East Asian descent groups and groups of severe epidemics.
However, reduced travel and heavy industrial closures have reduced air pollution indices and reduced carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health department of Wuhan, China, reported an unknown case of pneumonia and launched an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the South China seafood wholesale market, so the new coronary virus is considered to be a common animal.
The virus that triggered this outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely linked to bat coronary virus, mountain-caped coronary virus and SARS-CoV. The first discovered patient was confirmed on 1 December 2019 and was not clearly linked to a group of cases of South China seafood that emerged.
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were confirmed to be related to the South China Seafood Market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning newspaper published an unproven report that the first case may go back to November 17, 2019, with 55-year-old men from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the new cases reported in China had declined, but the new reported cases in Italy, Iran and Korea suddenly increased significantly, and that new cases outside China exceeded the country for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially minor cases.
As of 26 February, the reported cases of adolescents were relatively low, with only 2.4 per cent of young people aged 19 years and under. Patrick Valance, the leading British scientific adviser, estimated that about 60% of the UK would need about 60 per cent of the new coronary virus to get immune to effective groups.
Number of cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed positive results according to official programmes.
As of March 23, the proportion of groups tested worldwide did not exceed 3 per cent of the total population, and many countries had issued official policies for non-detected light-disease groups, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March noted that, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infected persons were not detected, while these unrecorded infections were 79% of the sources of infection.
According to a statistical analysis published on March 30, the actual number of infections in Italy exceeded the number of cases reported.
The basic number of infections (R0) of COVID-19 was originally estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by CDC shows that R0 may be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients can recover.
Unrehabilitated patients are 6-41 days, 14 days most common.
As of 10 April 2020, about 97,000 people died of COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80% of deaths in China were over 60 years of age, 75% of deaths were accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official statistics on deaths of COVID-19 deaths usually refer to positive deaths according to official programmes.
Actual COVID-19 deaths may be far beyond statistics, as the data may not contain patients who have not been tested, such as patients who die at home, sanatoriums, etc.
Some of the data from Italy show that the actual deaths during the epidemic are 4-5 times the number of deaths of the new coronary virus pneumonia.
A female spokesman at the CDC said, "We know that [published number of deaths] is below the actual value", while rumours of American data undervalued data have also confirmed this statement. Underestimating underestimation of American data. Underestimating the epidemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. On 9 January 2020, Wuhan had the first confirmed death case in Wuhan.
On February 1, the first death outside China appeared in the Philippines, and on February 14, the first death outside Asia appeared in France.
As of February 28, more than 10 deaths occurred outside China, Iran, Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories except Antarctica reported deaths. There are several ways to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to time, and are subject to detection, quality of health systems, treatment programmes, the first outbreak of the epidemic and the effects of population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health conditions. Death rates are the result of the number of deaths within the given time period, divided by the number of confirmed people.
According to John Hopkins University statistics, as of 10 April 2020, the global rate of death was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The rate of death in different regions is different.
In China, the estimated death rate fell from 17.3 per cent (1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (patients who have been sick after 1 February 2020). Other measures also include case mortality (CFR) and infected mortality (IFR), which reflects a percentage of the number of deaths of diseases as a percentage of confirmed people, which reflects the percentage of the number of sick deaths as a percentage of infection (including confirmed and undiagnosed).
These statistics have no time limits and tracks the entire process of the specific population from infection to case.
Many scholars try to calculate the data for specific groups.
According to Oxford University's evidence-based medical centre estimates that the overall infection mortality rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The estimate limit for this range is consistent with the first random test of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis study on the impact of CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization claims that the epidemic is manageable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and different from region.
Maciej Boni from Pennsylvania State University says, "If it is not controlled, the outbreak of infectious diseases usually enters a stagnant period after the existing host is exhausted and then starts to alleviate.
But it is almost impossible for us to predict when the turning point will appear ... "
Zhong Namshan, Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, believes that if all countries mobilize, adopt the World Health Organization ' s proposal to prevent virus transmission, then "the end of the epidemic in June is expected."
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "may explode repeatedly, lasting one to two years."
Neil Ferguson, led by the Imperial Institute of Technology, shows that "it may take 18 months or more until the vaccine is operational" is necessary to take physical distance and other measures.
William Schaffner from Van derburg University says, "This coronary virus is very contagious, and I think it's unlikely to disappear completely," "may turn into a seasonal disease, once a year."
The re-emergence of the disease depends on group immunity and mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some of the infected may have no symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are heat (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory slurry (sniffing), smell loss, gas, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headaches, cold, vomiting, blood, diarrhoea or hair. According to the World Health Organization, about one sixth of patients will be retarded and respiratory difficulties.
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) lists respiratory difficulties, continuous chest pains or stress, sudden ambiguity, difficulty of soberness and face or lips as urgent symptoms; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended that medical treatment be further. The further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, infectious shock and death.
Some infected persons may have no symptoms, no clinical performance, but positive results are positive, so researchers recommend close observation and inspection of persons diagnosed with close contact with patients, excluding possible infection.
China estimates that the rate of people infected without symptoms varies from very low to 44%.
The period of submersible (from infection to disease) is generally 1-14 days; 5 days is the most common. With regard to uncertainty, it can be described in one example: the share of patients who lose the smell of COVID-19 was initially estimated at 30%, and then to 15%.
Some details about the transmission of the disease have not yet been determined.
The disease is currently considered to be transmitted mainly through close contact and cough, sneeze or speaking; close contact means 1-2 m (3-6 ft).
Research found that non-covered cough could lead to the most distant spread of 4.5 metres (15 feet) - 8.2 m (15-27 feet).
It was also suggested that the foam that people used to stay in the air for longer periods in the air could also lead to the spread of the virus. Although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air, people may also produce a bubble when they breathe or speak.
This foam could fall into the mouth and nose of the surrounding people, even inhaled into the lungs.
Medical procedures such as intubation and CPR may fog respiratory genres and thus cause air transmission.
Also, if a person touches the surface contaminated with the virus (including skin) and then touch his nose and nose, it could also cause the virus to spread.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through excreta, but the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 excretion. The virus was most contagious three days before the disease, but was also contagious before and after the disease.
Positive results were detected at the first three days before the disease, which suggests that the new coronary virus was already contagious before the obvious symptoms were present.
Although there are few cases of symptoms diagnosed by laboratories, some countries have detected symptoms of non-suppressive infections during the tracking of contacts.
The European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) states that while the transmission of the new coronary virus is not fully clear, the general person will transmit 2-3 people. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface of the object.
Specifically, the new coronary virus is known to survive for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, survives a day on cardboard for up to four hours on copper.
However, its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the official British agencies suggest that people wash hands after exposure to animals, as if other surfaces that may be touched by other infected people.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first separated from three cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are presented in the relevant coronary virus in nature. The virus can kill them with domestic soap before it does not enter the human body, because soap can dissolve the virus's protective cyst. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
It's now considered a human and animal disease.
Genetic analysis shows that this coronary virus is genetically associated with the beta coronary virus as Sarbecovirus sub (B cluster) and two bat source viruses.
The new coronary virus and other bat coronary virus samples (BatCov RatG13) are 96% consistency at the full genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that some parts of the virus in the mountain armor and the virus on the human body were only one amino acid.
So far, the full genome comparison has found that the maximum genetic material between the mountain cape virus and SARS-CoV-2 is the same, and is not enough to prove that the armor is the middle host.
Whether the virus can be diagnosed with a preliminary diagnosis of symptoms, but eventually it will be diagnosed by the reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
A PCR comparison study in Wuhan shows that CT is clearly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and many imaging features are linked to other pneumonia and disease development processes.
As of March 2020, the American Radiology Society recommended that "CT is not suitable for screening COVID-19 or as the first test for diagnosis of the disease. "
The World Health Organization has now published several nucleic acid testing programmes for SARS-CoV-2, the first programme was published on January 17th.
Nucleic acid testing uses real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Respiratory samples or blood samples can be used for detection.
The results usually come from hours to days.
Generally, this test is carried out through noses and can be done through swallowing. Many laboratories and companies are developing serum tests for antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests had confirmed sufficient accuracy and could not be approved for extensive use.
In the United States, the serum test developed by Cellex has been approved for use by certified laboratories in emergencies only.
Typical imaging features of X and computer fault scans (CT) of patients include external grinding glass asymmetrics and chest-free cavity fluids.
The Italian Radiology Society is compile an international online database of image performance for confirmed cases.
The specificity of COVID-19 without PCR confirmed images is limited by re-enactment with other virus infections (e.g. gland viruses).
A large study in China compared the results of the chest CT with the PCR results that, although images are less specific to identifying infection, the detection is faster and more sensitive, and therefore consider it as a screening tool in popular areas.
A volume neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed to use X and CT to detect image features of the virus.
Measures to prevent disease transmission include good personal hygiene habits, handwashing hard, avoiding handwashing directly touching the nose, coughing or sneeze, covering their mouths and noses and throwing them directly into the trash can.
Suspected infected persons should wear medical surgical masks when entering public places.
It is also recommended that measures to maintain physical distance to prevent the transmission of the virus. Many Governments have limited or suggested avoiding travel to countries and territories affected by the epidemic without necessary circumstances.
However, the virus has now reached the community transmission phase in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community, and some community residents can't know where or how they are infected. Medical personnel who are exposed to suspected infected should take standard precautions, exposure to preventive measures and eye protection. Tracking contacts are important means of determining sources of transmission and prevention of further transmission by health regulators.
The Government ' s use of mobile phone positioning data for tracking purposes has raised concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations such as Amnesty International and others have made statements calling for restrictions on such oversight.
There are currently various mobile applications that have been put into use or access proposals for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working to study solutions with privacy protection, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
Once users have close contact with patients who are positive with the COVID-19 test results, they receive a reminder. The false speech on the prevention of infection continues to spread; it is invalid if you wash your nose and mouthwash.
There are no COVID-19 vaccines, but many organizations are actively developing.
It's recommended to stop the spread of disease by handwashing.
The Center for Disease Control recommends that people wash their hands with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially when there are visible stains after the toilet or hand, before dinner and snot, cough or sneeze.
It's because the virus can destroy the cysts by using domestic soap before entering the body.
The CDC also suggested that if there are no soap and tap water around them, at least 60% of alcohol-containing handwashing fluids can be used.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching eyes, noses or mouths without handwashing.
The surface of the object can be disinfected with multiple solutions (in one minute of stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium chlorate, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5 per cent polyethylene iodide.
Other solutions (e.g. ammonium phenylchlor and chlorthyl glucose acid) are less effective.
The Center for Disease Control recommends that new cases of suspected cases of coronary virus pneumonia or confirmed cases in facilities such as offices or day care facilities, should be disinfected in all regions, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablet computers, touch screens, keyboards, remote control machines and patients.
WHO recommends that people cover their mouths with bending elbows or paper towels while coughing or sneeze and deal with all contaminated paper towels immediately.
It is recommended that infected people wear medical surgical masks because wearing masks can reduce the amount of foam from sneeze and coughing and reducing the distance of transmission.
The World Health Organization has issued a note on the use of masks and methods of use.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, thinks, "Damn masks can reduce the tendency to touch people, and touch your face is a major source of infection in the absence of hand hygiene."
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy populations need masks only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for COVID-19 patients, but the organization also recognizes that wearing masks will help avoid touching their faces.
Some countries and territories have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. China clearly recommends that healthy citizens also wear one-time medical masks, especially in close contact with others within (1 m (3 feet).
Hong Kong, China proposes to wear masks when entering public transport or entering densely populated sites.
Thai health officials recommend homemade masks and clean every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are strictly forbidden to enter public places without masks or noses.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks to enter public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has provided that all persons need masks to enter a grocery store.
Israel demands that all residents need masks in public.
Taiwan, China, has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, and on April 1st, the need to wear masks on trains and intercity buses.
Panama has set out a mask and recommended that the residents who cannot buy masks.
The masks are also widely used in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Measures to maintain social distance (also known as maintaining physical distance) are designed to minimize close contact between people and people, thereby reducing the spread of diseases.
Measures include isolation; travel restrictions; suspension, suspension and closure of stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.
In terms of maintaining social distance, individual measures may include staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding access to dense areas of the population, to non-contact greetings and maintaining physical distance with others.
Now, many governments have forced or recommend social distance in areas affected by the epidemic.
With regard to the scale of the largest crowd, the initial proposal of the United States government institutions and WHO was 250 (in areas that were not transmitted by COVID-19), followed by a reduction of 50 and then reduced to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older persons and groups with basic diseases suffering from diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and immune systems are at higher risk. The German Center recommends that such people living in the area of the epidemic do not leave as much as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health institutions began replacing "maining social distance" with "maining physical distance" to clarify its aim to reduce physical contact while maintaining social ties, including virtual connections and distance links.
The term "maintening social distance" has a meaning that requires complete social isolation and does not encourage people to maintain human connections in other ways. Some authorities have also issued guidelines for sexual health applicable during the pandemic.
The recommendations include sexual relations with partners living alone and not infected with viruses or symptoms.
It is recommended that COVID-19 identify patients and suspected infected persons are self-separated.
The health agencies have issued a detailed description of the correct self-separation.
The most severe self-separation instructions were issued to the high-risk population.
If you may be exposed to COVID-19 patients or recently, countries or areas that are widely disseminated, they will be advised to isolate themselves from the time of possible exposure to the virus for 14 days.
Epidemic prevention and control strategies include containment/depression and mitigation.
The containment applies to the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of tracking and isolation of infected persons, while taking other infections and vaccination measures to prevent disease from spreading to others.
If the spread of diseases is no longer possible, efforts must be made to the mitigation phase: measures to reduce the spread of diseases and reduce the impact of diseases on health systems and society.
Cessation and mitigation measures can be carried out simultaneously.
The inhibition requires more extreme control measures to reverse the epidemic by reducing basic regeneration to below 1. Part of the work to reduce the outbreak of infectious diseases is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is what we know.
This reduces the risk of collapse of health services systems and more time for vaccine and treatment programmes.
Non-drug interventions that control the epidemic include personal precautions, such as maintaining hand hygiene, masks and self-separation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspension and elimination of large-scale assembly activities; community actions aimed at encouraging acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning. China immediately adopted more severe epidemics, such as closure and strict travel bans.
Other countries and territories have also taken measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Korea introduced large-scale screening and local isolation measures and released alerts on the trajectory of the infected.
Singapore provides financial support for self-separation infected persons, which impose huge fines for those who refuse to isolate themselves.
Taiwan, China, has increased mask production and imposed penalties for medical supplies sold. Simulations of the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation (reducing but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and inhibition (turning epidemic spread).
Best mitigation policies may reduce peak medical demand by 2/3, reducing the number of deaths by half, but it still leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths, causing the collapse of the health system.
The inhibition may be the preferred measure, but the virus needs to stop spreading in the crowd (or until the vaccine is launched, as the first-combated), otherwise once the relaxing measures, the spread will rebound quickly.
Long-term intervention aimed at inhibiting the pandemic can bring social and economic costs.
No special effects anti-virus drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development are still under way, including tests of existing drugs.
Take non-prescription cold medicine, rehydration and rest may help to alleviate symptoms.
Based on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, veins and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids could cause deterioration.
Several compounds previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied to determine whether it applies to COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also noted that some "traditional and home therapy" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization noted that improving processing capacity and adjusting the medical system to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is basic epidemic response.
ECDC and the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospital and primary health care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including the concentration of laboratory services at COVID-19 testing, removing selective procedures, separation and isolation of COVID-19 positive patients, as well as improving intensive care capacity through training and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are many speculations about the origin of the first case (the so-called zero).
The first known case of coronary virus pneumonia may date back to December 1, 2019, in Hubei Wuhan, China.
In a month, the number of new coronary viruses in Hubei province increased.
Most of these patients are related to the wholesale market for South China, which also sells living animals, a theory that the new coronary virus is derived from some of these animals; or, in other words, it originated in human animals. On December 26, the doctor of the Central West Medical Hospital in Hubei province first discovered and treated an unknown group of pneumonia patients and reported to the Jianghan District Center for Disease Prevention and Control in Wuhan on 27 December.
On December 30th, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital reminded his colleagues to be alert to a coronary virus like SARS.
Eight doctors, including Li Wen-Lang, were warned by the police for spreading rumors, and another doctor, Even, was warned by his superiors for the sound of the alarm.
The Wuhan City Health Committee then issued a bulletin on December 31st and reported to the World Health Organization.
The Wuhan health department received numerous reported cases of pneumonia, an investigation was launched in early January.
From early January to mid-January 2020, the virus spreads to other provinces of China by the population of Spring Festival and Wuhan as a transport hub and major railway hub.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases within one day, including 2 Beijing and 1 Shenzhen.
The subsequent official data show that, as of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States confirmed cases exceeded China and Italy, becoming the country with the largest confirmed cases worldwide. As of 9 April 2020, more than 161,000 cases were reported; more than 97,000 deaths and more than 36.4 million cases were cured.
There are reported confirmed cases in some 200 countries and territories around the world.
As affected by the European epidemic, many countries in the Schengen region have taken control measures to limit the free movement of the population and the establishment of border controls.
State-level responses include containment, such as isolation (also known as home order, shelter or blockade) and curfew. As of 2 April, there were nearly 300 million people in the United States, i.e. about 90 per cent of the total population, with more than 50 million people in a state of blockade in the Philippines, and about 59 million people in South Africa were blocked, and 1.3 billion people in India were blocked.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of blockade, and two days later this figure increased to 2.6 billion, or about one third of the global population.
The first COVID-19 confirmed case dates back to 1 December 2019, located in Wuhan; an unproven report speculated the first case dates back to November 17th.
Dr. Zhang discovered an unknown number of cases of pneumonia on December 26th, where the hospital reported this situation to the disease prevention and control centre in the Ganghan district of Wuhan City on December 27th.
On December 27, 2019, a coronary virus similar to SARS was found in a preliminary genetic test of patients' samples.
The Wuhan City Health Committee issued a bulletin on December 31st.
Report to the World Health Organization on the same day.
After these notifications, several doctors in Wuhan City were warned by the police for walking the epidemic.
The China National Health and Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of the human being.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical movement, and later, General Secretary of the Communist Party, Xi Jinping, called it a "people war" that contained the spread of viruses.
On January 23rd, the government announced the launch of a quarantine line in Wuhan, which banned people from entering Wuhan, which then extended to 15 other cities in Hubei, totalling about 57 million people, known as "the largest quarantine incident in human history".
The city is forbidden to use private cars.
Many places have also cancelled the celebration of the New Year of the Chinese Agricultural Calendar.
The government also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Fire Mountain Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Then another hospital, Ray Shinyama Hospital, was built for more patients.
In addition to the new hospital, China has converted 14 other sites in Wuhan, such as the Convention Center and Stadium, into square-class hospitals. On January 26, the Government took further measures to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issuance of health declarations and extended spring holidays.
The national university and primary schools are also completely suspended.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions of China have also taken a number of measures, particularly in response to primary and secondary and higher education.
China has many remote home-based office measures.
In addition to Hubei, other identity restrictions have been imposed.
Public transport has been adjusted and museums across China are temporarily closed.
Many cities have introduced public activity facilities, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (over half of the population) are restricted by some form of outdoor activity. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "input" from other countries and territories.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day compulsory isolation of all people outside Kyoto. Within 5 days before March 23, there was only one indigenous case in mainland China, which was transmitted by a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the transmission of indigenous cases had been largely contained and the Chinese epidemic was controlled.
On the same day, the Hubei region, other than Wuhan, began to release the restrictions on two months after the blockade. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas and residence permits had not disclosed details on when the policy ended.
People who want to enter China need to apply for a visa from the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to resume work on March 30 and provided a monetary stimulus plan for businesses. The State Council announced that April 4th as a national mourning day and launched a three-minute national silent event at 10:00 on that day.
On January 20, 2020, COVID-19 confirmed cases in Korea.
The Korean Health Agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, mainly due to a new religious campaign rally in Daeju, Korea, the Church of Jesus.
The new world from Wuhan to Daeqiu is suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9,336 church believers, 1,261, or about 13% reported symptoms. Korea announced its highest alert level on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, Korea reported more than 2,000 confirmed cases, increasing to 3,150 on February 29th.

Most major sports events were forced to be cancelled or postponed, including 2019-20 European Championships, 2019-20 British Super League, 2020 European Championships, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 National hockey Federation season.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympic Plan scheduled to be held at the end of July; the IOC announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled after 2020, but not later than the summer 2021". Casinos and other lottery sites around the world were closed and the live poker competition was forced to postpone or cancel.
This has led to the shift of many gamblers to online gambling, and many online gambling sites reported a significant increase in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, and music groups have suspended or cancelled the tour.
A lot of big theatres, like the Broadway Theatre, have suspended all the shows.
Some artists have also managed to continue to create and share works through the Internet to replace traditional live performances such as live concerts, or create a web Festival for artists to perform, distribute and promote their works.
On the Internet, many web-based fans, on the theme of the new coronary virus, are spreading, and many people are beginning to turn to a sense of humor and attention.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, xenophobia and racial discrimination are increasing against Chinese, East Asian descent and hot spots from Europe, the United States and other countries.
Many countries and territories, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have experienced fear, suspicion and hatred.
Many reports in February this year (most of the cases were still limited to China) recorded the racist sentiment of different groups worldwide against Chinese, arguing that the Chinese should be infected with the virus or accept so-called legitimate revenge.
Some African countries have also experienced a rise in anti-China sentiment.
According to reports, many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei have been subjected to geographical discrimination.
On the line and online, there are voices that support Chinese and residents of the severe epidemic.
As the epidemic spreads to other hot spots, Italy became Europe's first country with a serious outbreak of COVID-19, and the population from the country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia.
In Japan, the topic "China DontCometo Japan" was widely disseminated on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in England and the United States reported that racial abuse and attacks are increasing.
President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the new coronary virus "China virus", and critics believe that their statements were racist and anti-China.
Ukrainian protesters attacked a bus from Wuhan to New Sanzari, containing Ukrainian and foreign evacuators.
Students from north-east India (border China) were reportedly harassed by students from leading cities in India.
The President of the Indian People ' s Party of Bangladesh, Dilip Gosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature, "So God will avenge them."
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, claiming that their "mistakes". In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination suffered by non-Chinese residents also increased by the epidemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and should be targeted as "spam disposal".
Many newspapers with a pay wall have partially or all reports about the new coronary virus removes the restrictions on the pay wall.
Many scientific publishers have published some scientific papers on the epidemic.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their research on preprint servers like bioRxiv.

2019 Laboratory detection methods for respiratory coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include detection of the existence of the virus and whether antibodies are produced after infection.
RT-PCR detects RNA of the coronary virus and thus determines whether there is a virus in the sample.
This test is a specific test for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It can be used to determine whether it is recently infected or active.
Antibody testing (sero-test) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people have infected the virus, including those with minor symptoms without reporting or symptoms.
This test results determine the accurate death rate of disease and the level of immunization among groups in the population.
As a result of the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country/region can provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country/region had more than 3 per cent of their population, and the number of tests completed by countries/regions had a significant difference.
This difference may also seriously affect the reported mortality rate of cases, which may be severely overestimated in some countries.
Real-time reverse polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) using throat sweezers, which can only be achieved within the first week of the infection.
Normally, the results are available within hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests using swallowing can only be achieved within the first week of the infection.
Then the virus disappeared in the throat, but continued to breed in the lungs.
For those who are tested in the second week of infection, samples can be replaced with deep breath extracts obtained through straws, or can be used for coughing (slurry).
In January 2020, rRT-PCR was released at Charité Hospital in Berlin, one of the early PCR tests and became the basis for 250,000 test reagent boxes distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed a test method. On January 28, 2020, the Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical level based on PCR SARS-CoV-2 Test Reagent Box (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It seeks all the "E" genes shared with the beta coronary virus, and the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene. In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the approval of the Chinese National Drug Supervisory Authority on the production of SARS-CoV-2 detection reagent boxes based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed 2019 new coronary viruses to public health laboratories through the international reagent resource sector (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel.
The early version of the test reagent box uses three genetic tests, one of which is unable to determine results due to reagent defects, while Atlanta CDC has detected bottlenecks; this led to less than 100 samples successfully processed every day throughout February 2020.
The test that contains two parts was not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, when the state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Regulatory Authority under emergency use authorization.
LabCorp announced that the RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test could be conducted throughout the country as of March 5, 2020.
Quest Diagnostics also announced that it would provide a national COVID-19 test from March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were announced; sample collection and processing must be performed according to the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, COVID-19 is responsible for the development and production of the National Center for Virusology and Biotechnology (VECTOR).
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federation Health Supervisory Authority. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Meo Clinic developed a reagent box that detects COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, a test method of Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA, which could complete a large number of tests within 3.5 hours, thus achieving approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the emergency use authorization for testing using the Abbott m2000 system (EUA); FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, one of Cepheid's methods that also took about 45 minutes of testing was equally authorized by the FDA for emergency use.
FDA has approved a test method for replacing PCR using temperature expansion techniques such as nucleic acid.
Because the method does not require a series of warming cycles, it can produce positive results in only five minutes, and negative results can be determined in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such devices in the United States, and Abbott is expected to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a detection method using single clone antibodies (specially combined with the new coronary virus) to provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as fast influenza tests.
A summary of a literature in March 2020 concluded that "In the early stages of the virus, the diagnosis of the chest is very valuable, and the performance of the CT may be obvious, even before the symptoms appear."
The typical features of CT include double-pulmonary multileaf grinding glass, with external asymmetric and back parts.
As the disease progresss, the visibleness of the chest, the gravel and the lung changes will be developed.
A PCR and CT study that compares Wuhan (where the initial outbreak of the pandemic) shows that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but CT is less accurate, and many of its image characteristics overlap with other pneumonia and diseases.
As of March 2020, the American Radiology Society recommended that "CT should not be used to screen COVID-19 or as a first-line detection tool for diagnostic COVID-19". Since March 2020, CDC has recommended initial screening using PCR.
Some of the immune reactions to infection are antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections about seven days after the start of symptoms to determine the immunization of the monitored population.
The high flux automatic systems in many clinical laboratories can be measured, but their availability depends on the productivity of the systems.
For CLT, although the immune reaction can be tracked by serial samples, it usually uses an external blood sample to be measured.
For PoCT, a blood sample is usually obtained using skin piercing.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved the test method, which is now able to distribute its antibodies test box. On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved 29 entity declarations, which are now able to distribute their antibodies test reagent boxes.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA had approved only one test on the basis of emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, the test reagent box of Omont Medical Experimental Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics was approved in Europe, which could be tested for virus testing in blood samples.
The detection capability is hundreds of samples within hours, so it's much faster than the traditional PCR determination.
In general, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection. Early in April, Britain found that there was no good enough for the antibodies test reagent box it purchased.
Hong Kong has established a mechanism for suspected patients to live home, "The Emergency Room provides a sample test tube for patients", and the patient spits saliva into the test tube and then send the test tube back and will receive the results later. NHS announced that it would take appropriate preventive measures to detect suspected cases, which would eliminate the risk of the patient ' s access to the hospital, or to eliminate the risk of disinfection of ambulances after using an ambulance. In the case of the absence of access to COVID-19 suspected cases, medical professionals could take appropriate preventive measures to extract samples.
In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Doctors stated on March 2, that non-inpatient institutions were capable of conducting approximately 12,000 tests per day, and 10,700 tests were tested last week.
If it's tested at the request of a doctor, the cost is borne by health insurance.
According to the Director of Robert Koch Institute, Germany, the total testing capacity in Germany is 160,000 per week.
As of March 19, a number of large cities had been provided with free access tests.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only the test results were reported positive.
An initial laboratory survey showed that, as of the 12th week 2020, at least 483,295 samples (including the 12th week of 2020), the detection of 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) SARS-CoV-2 positive. Researchers at Israel, Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method for testing samples simultaneously, i.e., the summary of samples and further testing only when the combined sample was found positive. In Wuhan, the China Gene (BGI) temporarily established a 2000-metre emergency testing laboratory called Fire Eye, which was operational on 5 February 2020, and more than 10,000 samples per day.
The laboratory was built five days under the supervision of Wang Jian, the founder of the Chinese gene, showed that if it did not reach the above detection capability, the case in Hubei would be 47% higher, and the corresponding treatment of isolation costs would double.
Following the Wuhan Laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately established fire-eye laboratories, and 12 cities in China have now established the laboratory.
By 4 March 2020, the total number of laboratory tests had a total of 50,000 copies per day. Origami Asssays released open source, multi-road design, which could be tested only by 93 measurements, COVID19 tests could be tested for up to 1122 patients. These balanced designs can be operated in small laboratories without automatic liquid transferers.
As of March, the shortage and insufficient number of reagents had become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led to the exploration of sample preparation programmes by some sponsors involving heating samples up to 98  degrees C (208, F) to 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on 31 March that new coronary virus tests had been tested for more people, more of its population, more than any other country and is expanding the level of testing to allow a large number of people to be tested.
The way to achieve this detection capability is to use the drive-through detection on the one hand, and on the other hand, the establishment of high-through laboratories to respond to large-scale population detection needs for large-scale population detection.
The laboratory was built within 14 days and can conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, the first laboratory operating outside China in the world.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed different detection methods for various parts of the coronary virus gene mapping.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing test reagent boxes to send reagent boxes to low-income countries without resources.
The German approach was published on January 17, 2020; the programme developed by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention was available after 28 January, thereby limiting the detection capacity of the United States. China and the United States had encountered problems with the reliability of the detection box in the early stages of the outbreak, which were unable to provide sufficient testing boxes to meet demand and health experts.
On the contrary, experts believe that extensive testing in Korea is helpful in reducing the spread of new coronary viruses.
Thanks to the testing capacity established by the Korean government over the past few years, it is concentrated in private sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programmes as the best way to slow the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The widespread transmission of the virus led to a very large demand for testing, which has put hundreds of thousands of tests in the United States and to become tense.
In March 2020, China reported the accuracy of its test reagent box.
In the United States, the test reagent box developed by the CDC has "deficiencies"; then the government removed bureaucratic barriers that impede private laboratory testing. Spain purchased a test box from the Chinese company Shenzhen Ire Biotechnology Ltd. and found inaccurate results.
The company explained that the results were inaccurate that the results were caused by the uncorrect collection of samples or misuse of the test reagent box.
The Spanish Cabinet stated that the reagent box that returned the wrong result and replaced it with another reagent box provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China were incorrect. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China, and found inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovio suggested that these test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. Ate- Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that Turkey had purchased the test box from China was "high error rate" and did not "input them." The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test boxes from China and announced in April 2020 that these test boxes were not available.
Testing and isolation of positive personnel and tracking the history of exposure of SARS-CoV-2 positive personnel, which can be positive.
Researchers working in the city of Italy (the first COVID-19 patient in Italy) conducted two rounds of testing a total of about 3,400 people, approximately 10 days apart each.
About half of them detected positive and without symptoms, and all cases found were isolated.
Through restrictions on the community, new infections are completely eliminated.
Through large-scale tracking contacts, restrictions on entry travel, detection and isolation, 2020 coronary virus transmission in Singapore is much slower than other developed countries/regions, and Singapore has not taken extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail sites.
Singapore cancelled many activities and started recommending residents to stay home on March 28th, but the school resumed on time on March 23rd.
Several other countries/areas, such as Ireland and Korea, have also controlled the massive epidemic of disease through large-scale tracking contacts, restrictions on entry travel, detection and isolation and less radical blockade measures.
A statistical study found that the lower the number of cases compared to the number of deaths, the lower the mortality rate of their cases, which may be able to better detect groups with only minor symptoms or symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with limited experience with COVID-19 at the national laboratory, send their first five positive and top 10 negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of these 16 comparable laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and one in Australia.
In the following chart, the "test positive %" column is influenced by the national testing policy.
In other conditions, the positive examination rate is higher in the country where all citizens are detected (whether or not symptoms) are tested only.
Handwashing, also known as hand cleaning, clean hands to clear dust, fat, microorganisms or other useless substances.
At some "critical moments" every day insists to hand hands with soap to prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be transmitted through septic-mouth.
If people don't wash their hands before they touch their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. glue), they may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or normal flu.
Five critical moments to wash your hands with soap in one day: before and after defecation, cleaning the child's hips or diapers, before and after feeding the child, before and after eating, before and after the food, before and after processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Without soap and water, we can clean hands with grass and ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands if:
Before you prepare food, in the process and after.
Take care of the patient.
Change diapers or cleaning the hips of a toilet child.
Slut, cough or sneeze.
Touch animals, animal food or animal shit.
Medical personnel are health habits related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases ...
In the medical field, the main purpose of handwashing is to remove pathogens that may harm humans or cause disease (bacterias, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals.
Handwashing is particularly important for people working in food processing or in the field of medical care, but it is also important for the public.
(b) The health benefits of handwashing are significant, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses and other infectious diseases; prevention of infectious diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reduce infant mortality rates at home.
A 2013 study showed that improving handwashing habits have slightly contributed to the increase in the height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoea diseases can be reduced by promoting simple behavioural changes (e.g. handwashing with soap).
This simple act reduces the death rate of the disease by almost 50%.
The intervention that advocates handwashing can reduce the occurrence of diarrhoea by about one third, which is equivalent to providing clean water sources in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap can reduce diarrhoea by 48%. As self-issued in families, schools and communities around the world, handwashing with soap is the most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections.
Pneumonia, as a major acute respiratory infection, is the primary cause of death of children under five years of age, and pneumonia takes the lives of about 1.8 million children every year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children die every year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund indicated that, before and after any single vaccine or medical intervention, before and after toilet into deep-rooted habits, could save more lives, reducing diarrhoean deaths by almost half, reducing deaths from acute respiratory infections by one quarter.
As part of the water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) projects, other sanitation interventions are usually taken while advocating handwashing.
Handwashing can also prevent scabs that spread through direct physical contact.
Handwashing can have a slight adverse effect, i.e. frequent handwashing can cause skin drying, thereby causing skin damage.
A study in Denmark in 2012 found that overwashing can cause skin itching, cracks, known as hand rash or hand-skinitis, which is particularly common among medical staff.
Over-frequency handwashing is also considered one of the symptoms of coercion.
To reduce the spread of diseases, five critical moments of soap must be washed with soap in one day: after cleaning children ' s hips (replacement of diapers), before and after cleaning children, before eating, before and after dealing with raw meat, fish or poultry.
To prevent the spread of diseases, handwashing in the right way in the following cases: treatment of the cut or the wound; sneeze, cough or snot; touch animal shit or after handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries/regions, the proportion of handwashing with soap is low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7 per cent of households used to wash soap. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest proportion, reaching 97 per cent; the United States was close to average, or 77 per cent; China's lowest, 23 per cent. Now, to advocate for washing hands with soap at critical times, several ways to change behaviour. To make children grow their handwashing habits, developing countries can choose to allow school children to wash their hands.
The Basic Health Programme, launched by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is a model of large-scale initiatives to promote children's health and learning.
The core of this national plan is to deworm twice a year, with soap and brushing teeth with fluorine toothpaste.
In Indonesia, this plan has also been successfully implemented.
Water is integrated into soap or cleaners, which better remove microbes on skin.
The main effect of soap and cleaning agents is to reduce dissolved barriers and improve soluble.
Water alone cannot be effectively cleaned because fat and proteins (parts of organic soil) are not soluble in water.
But cleaning hands requires reasonable water...
Solid soap may be stored in bacteria that were previously used because they could be reused.
A small study has investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap, which concluded that bacteria cannot be transferred because bacteria will be washed off by foams.
But the CDC still claims that "bestly choose non-contact liquid soap".
Antibacterial soap has been greatly promoted among healthy public people.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antibacterials or disinfectants has chosen antibiotics resistance microorganisms in nature.
However, anti-bacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as trichlorosa, with a large amount of drug-resistant microbicide strain.
So, even if anti-bacterial soap is not for antibiotics resistance strain, anti-bacterial soap may not be as effective as propaganda.
In addition to surface active agents and skin-care agents, complex formulations may also contain acid (acetic acid, anti-facetic acid, lactate), anti-bacterial active phenylace acid, and more skin modems (gills, vitamins, mint alcohol, plant extractions). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon Public Health Institute shows that ordinary soap is the same as in the prevention of disease and removal of bacteria in hand.
Hot water washes comfortable, but it's not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria breed fast at body temperature (37       degreesC).
But in removing natural oils containing earth and bacteria, hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water.
Scientific research has confirmed that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing microorganisms in the hands, contrary to the general view.
Water-free handwashing or non-cleaning handwashing is a non-water-based hand cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early twenty-first century, non-water-based alcohol hand cleaners (also known as alcohol-scratch, free of handwashing or handwashing fluids).
Most of these handwashing formulations contain isopropanol or ethanol, and the addition of densers such as Capom (propylene polymer) to form gels, or wetting agents such as glycerine to form liquids, or foams for easy use and mitigate the dry skin from alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide after diluted can further increase antibacterial activity. At least 60 to 95% of alcohol free handwashing fluids can be effective.
Alcohol-scratch can kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA) and anti-Vrecinin intestinal fungus (VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory hysteria virus (RSV), nose virus, pox, flu and hepatitis).
After 70% of alcohol is used in 30 seconds, the bacteria in their hands can kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria in their hands (a decrease of 3.5 quantitative levels, similar to 35 dB), and the hand-swipe reduction in 99.99% to 99.999% (4-5 quantitative levels) in one minute.
Alcohol twilight fluids are almost completely ineffective for viruses such as Norovirus, also known as Novak, Norwalk (the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal inflammation) ... enough free-free handwashing or alcohol handwashing must be used to completely wet or cover hands.
Wash the hand and back and the finger and all the end of fingers for about 30 seconds until liquid, foam or gel dry.
The fingertips must also be fully cleaned, wash their fingers on two palms. The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the best to wash hands, not to wash hands, especially when it looks dirty.
Because such handwashing fluids are easy to use and quickly make microorganisms lose their activity; however, they should not replace the right handwashing unless there is no soap and water available.
Frequent alcohol-free handwashing fluids can cause dry skin drying unless skin and/or wetting agents are added in the formula.
Glycerine and/or other skin lubricants can be added to the formulation to reduce or eliminate the dry skin caused by alcohol.
In clinical experiments, alcohol-free handwashing fluids containing skin-resilient agents can significantly reduce skin irritation and skin drying.
Allergies are exposed to skin inflammation, exposure to measles syndrome or allergies to additives in alcohol or alcohol.
It's one of its attractive reasons why alcohol is free from handwashing fluid to induce stimulating contact skin inflammation compared to soap and water.
Water-free cleaners, though effective, do not remove organic matter on your hands, but only disinfect it.
Therefore, handwashing fluids are less effective than soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as these pathogens are still in hand.
The effect of the non-alcohol-free handwashing fluid depends heavily on the composition and formulation, which has always been much less effective than alcohol and alcohol.
Recently, the formulation using phenylzachlor has been confirmed to have continued and cumulative antibacterial activity after use, unlike alcohol, and alcohol has been proven to be reduced after reuse, possibly due to a gradual cause of adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford soap, and can be replaced by grass ash or earth.
Grass ash or earth are better than washing water alone, but not as much as soap.
One problem is that if earth or grass ash is contaminated with microorganisms, then it may accelerate the spread of diseases rather than slow transmission.
Like soap, grass ash is a disinfectant because it forms alkaline solutions after water.
WHO suggests that if soap is available, we can replace soap with grass ash or sand.
The correct handwashing steps recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States to prevent disease transmission are as follows:
Wetting hands with mobile warm water or cool water.
It's recommended that water flow is because the vertical basin may be contaminated, and the temperature seems to be irrelevant.
Use full soap to re-wash the foam, while cleaning the back, between fingers and nails.
Soap removes bacteria on the skin, and research shows that people wash their hands more completely when they use soap instead of water alone.
At least 20 seconds.
Scratch can produce friction, which helps remove bacteria on the skin, the longer the time you wash, the more bacteria removed.
Clean up with water.
Wash your water basins can cause re-contaminated.
Dry or dry with clean towels.
The wet hands are more easily contaminated, thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers and nail stitches are the most often neglected parts.
Artificial nails and broken nail polish may hide microbes.
Wet emulsions are usually recommended to avoid dry hands; skin drying causes skin damage, thereby increasing the risk of infection transmission.
In places where developing countries cannot access tap water and/or soap, low-cost measures are provided to facilitate handwashing, such as water-saving through a barrel or holes, and/or handwashing with grass ash (when necessary). In cases where limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving washing programmes, such as simple water taps and other low-cost ways.
The simple tap technology is simple, hang a water can with a rope, then pour a small amount of water to his hand through a pedal, and then use soap.
Effective dry hands are an important step in hand-care processes, but there are some arguments about the most effective way of doing things in public health.
More and more research shows that paper towels are more sanitary than electric dry phones provided in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study sponsored by the European Paper towel Research Society (European Tissue Symposium) in the paper towel industry, compared to paper towels, warm wind dry phones and more modern jet dry phones, in terms of hygiene.
After washing hands, dry hands with warm wind dry phones, found that the total number of bacteria on the finger increased by 194 per cent, and an average increase in the total bacteria on hand palms by 254%.
And with a jet dry cell phone, the total number of bacteria on fingers increased by 42%, and the total number of bacteria on hand palms increased by 15%.
The total number of bacteria on the finger decreased by 76%, with an average decrease in the total number of palm bacteria by 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether various dry methods could cause cross-infection among other bathroom users and bathroom facilities.
The jet dry phone allegedly sprayed air at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 miles per hour) can blow out microorganisms on your hands and machines, which could contaminate other bathroom users and bathroom facilities within 2 metres.
The use of warm wind dry phones can spread microbes to 0.25 meters outside the dry phone.
The results of the use of paper towel dry hands show that there will be no serious microbiological transmission. In 2005, the T.V Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess different dry methods.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after the dry hands:
The study has a lot of different dry cell phone producers, comparing these dry phones with paper towels.
During the trip, without soap and water, you can use the hand to disinfect the wet towels.
Alcohol-free handwashing fluid should be at least 60%.
Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis found in 1846 to effectively prevent disease transmission in hospitals, but a long time later, medical personnel were forced to wash their hands.
Hospitals use electronic equipment that can provide feedback to remind hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
A study found that the infection rate has decreased after the use of these devices.
Medical personnel wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, using full amount of soap and water or gel when washing their hands to produce foams and wash hands.
Hands and fingers with each other.
If there's a residue between nails, you can clear it with a hard brush.
Because the moisture left on your hands may still be bacteria, it must be fully cleaned and dry with clean towels.
After drying, the water tap should be used to close the tap (when necessary, open the exit door with paper towels).
This prevents the contamination of hands because of exposure to these surfaces.
In health institutions, the purpose of washing hands is to eliminate pathogens and avoid spreading.
Report in the New England Medical Journal shows that there are still situations where handwashing is not acceptable in most medical environments, and that a large number of medical personnel often forget to wash hands before they contact patients, leading to microbiological transmission.
One study shows that correct handwashing, with other simple procedures, can reduce the blood flow rate associated with catheters by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a sheet that demonstrated standard handwashing and hand-scraping methods in medical institutions.
The organization also published a draft manual health guide on its website to obtain public opinion.
Whitby and others have made a summary.
If there is a need to confirm compliance with the regulations, commercial equipment can be measured and validated by the Ministry of Health.
The World Health Organization recommends "five moments" to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluid
Before the sterile operation and
After taking care of the patient, adding anti-bacterial chemicals to soap ( "sap" or "anti-bacterial soap") can make handwashing agents to microbicide.
In an environment with a large number of antibiotics resistant microorganisms before surgery or in an environment with a large number of antibiotics resistant microorganisms. When "washing" hands for surgery, there must be other sterile tools that can be opened and shut down without contact, chlorine-based or iodized handwashing, dry hands-washing towels, other sterile tools for washing hands and cleaning nails.
All the jewelry is taken off.
This program requires cleaning hands, forearms, usually 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take long cleaning (10 minutes).
When you wash, you must prevent the water on the forearm from going back to your hand.
After washing your hands, wipe hands with sterile cloth and wear surgical clothes.
To reduce bacterial transmission, before and after exposure to patients, wash hands or use free of washing fluid.
To control the glucose infection in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands was that when washing hands reached 20%, further benefits were extremely limited when cleaning hands increased to over 35%.
The use of ordinary soap can cause more than three times the proportion of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food than the use of anti-bacterial soap. After the use of alcohol-swipe hands and handwashing hands with anti-bacterial soap (30 seconds respectively), the proportion of bacterial infections using alcohol is 26% lower than anti-bacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-scattered hand-swipes, soap and water are more effective than alcohol hand-swipe. By training staff to hand-washing, increasing the supply of alcohol hand-scrackers and interventions such as written and oral alerts to employees.
The most effective intervention in various medical environments requires further research.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an important tool for cost-effective health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people ' s homes, schools and workplaces, makes universal handwashing a challenge.
For example, in most rural African areas, even if there are cheap ways to build handwashing tables, there is a very rare case with handwashing taps near each private bathroom or public health.
But the low frequency of handwashing may also be a deep-rooted habit, not because of the lack of soap or water.
Promotion and advocacy for soap washing can influence policy development, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and leading to long-term behavioural changes in the population.
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation must be conducted.
A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) increased hand-washing (LMICs) was effective in community-based methods, while social marketing activities were less effective. One example in schools advocating handwashing is the "star approach" introduced by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and cheap measures to ensure that students use hand-washing soap.
When the minimum standard is met, the school can rise from one star to the highest three stars.
Handwashing activities can include the construction of handwashing tables to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of handwashing awareness is World Handwashing Day, which aims to try to achieve behavioural change. Because of the 2019-20 coronary virus epidemic, UNICEF promotes the use of a handwashing emoticon symbol.
Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries and the life-saving year of disability adjustment (DALY).
However, reports show that the cost of promoting soap washing is more significant compared to other water and sanitation interventions.
The first recognition of the importance of handwashing to human health - especially those who are weak (e.g. mothers or wounded soldiers who have just produced in hospitals) were pioneers in the middle of the 19th century: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, founder of Modern Nursing.
At that time, most people still thought infection was caused by the smell of poison.
The outbreak of food-borne diseases and medical infections in the 1980s has prompted the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand health, emphasizing that hand-care is an important way to prevent infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, has made many countries more aware of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect people from infection with such infectious diseases.
For example, Germany hangs the "Right Handwashing" poster by the public health room, office building and the airport bathroom.
The word "do your hands" means someone's not willing to be responsible for something or not to participate in something.
It's from the Bible Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washes his hands after deciding to nail Jesus, and then evolved into a wide range of language language in some English-speaking groups.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. McBer started to force hand hands in trying to clean the imaginary stains, indicating that she felt guilty about the crimes committed and encouraging her husband to commit crimes.
Studies show that people who think or imagine immoral behaviour tend to wash hands more frequently than others and often value handwashing facilities more often than others.
Moreover, those who can wash hands after the idea of immoral behaviour are unlikely to do other "purified" compensation actions, such as volunteers.
Religion requires handwashing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. The symbolic handwashing of water while washing without soap is part of many religious landmark handwashing gifts, including Bahai faith, Hinduism, Jewish bathing and handwashing (netilat yadayim) clean manners, handwashing in Christianity and small cleanness in Islam. Religions and hygiene regulations, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam demand to wash their hands after toilet.
Hindus, Buddhism, Sikhs, Judaism and Islam require handwashing before and after dinner.
COVID-19 Workplace Control
COVID-19 Workplace control means the prevention of coronary virus diseases using anti-controlled occupational safety and health measures 2019 (COVID-19).
Whether hazard control in the workplace depends on specific work sites and tasks and should be determined on the risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of community diseases and risk factors that may be exposed to COVID-19.
In accordance with the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Authority (OSHA), low exposure to the profession of the public and other colleagues is the least accessible to the public and other colleagues, and therefore recommends basic infection prevention measures, including handwashing, encouraging staff to isolate after-patient homes, to comply with respiratory manners and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium exposure risk work includes the need for frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients, which may cause infection due to continuous community transmission or international travel.
Including staff with access to the general public, such as schools, high population density working environments and some large-scale retail environments.
In addition to basic infection precautions, the group should use efficient air filters and sneeze protection devices for ventilation, wearing personal protective equipment and other risk control measures when exposed to COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers that medical personnel and staff in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients have a high risk of exposure, and the exposure risk becomes extremely high if staff members perform high exposure to known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collected or processed samples from them.
Hazard control measures applicable to such persons include engineering controls, such as negative ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their work tasks.
COVID-19 outbreak could have a serious impact on the workplace.
Staff members may be absent from illness, need to take care of others or fear of exposure.
Business models may also change, including changes in commodity demand, or access to these commodities (e.g. shopping at non-peak times, or use distribution or free delivery services).
Finally, product logistics from areas of the serious COVID-19 outbreak may be interrupted.
These programmes address risk levels related to various workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from the family and community environment and risk factors for individual workers, such as older persons or groups suffering from chronic diseases.
These plans also outline the measures required to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise from the outbreak.
Infectious diseases prevention and response plans may require compliance with national or local recommendations.
The goal of responding to the outbreak includes reducing inter-staff transmission, protection of people with higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, response measures are affected by the severity of the community in which the enterprise is located.
Hazard control levels are widely used in occupational safety and health control frameworks for grouping risk control measures in accordance with effectiveness.
If the harm of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measure is engineering control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering control means the isolation of employees from the risks of work, not on the behaviour of employees, which is also the least cost-effective solution.
Administrative control means changing work policies or procedures, requiring staff or employer to take action on their own ...
Personal protective equipment (PPE) has a lower control effect than engineering control and administrative control, but helps prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE are subject to the risk level faced by staff, equipped with (e.g. respirators) as applicable and must be worn correctly, regular inspection and maintenance, replacement, as necessary, clean, stored or processed to avoid pollution.
According to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Authority (OSHA), low exposure is the least in professional contact with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended that basic infection precautions are recommended in all workplaces, including hard-working handwashing, suggesting that the sick employees are isolated, coughing or sneeze, provide paper towels and trash cans, prepare for remote office, and leave, and to persuade employees from using other people's tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection in the workplace.
Timely identification and isolation of potential infectious individuals is key to protecting workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who show acute respiratory symptoms should be isolated for at least 24 hours until it is determined that there is no heat, fever signs and any other symptoms, sick leave policies should be implemented flexibly, allowing employees to take care of their families and should clearly inform the policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure risk work includes frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within 6 feet (1.8 m), but may cause individuals to communicate with SARS-CoV-2 as a result of continuous community transmission near the workplace or have recently been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the recent possible COVID-19 outbreak area.
Such staff include staff members who are employed in schools, high population density working environments and some large quantities of retail environments. Engineering control measures for this group and high-risk groups include the installation of efficient air filters, increased ventilation, transparent plastic sneeze protections and providing customer services. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups include encouraging sick employees to home separation, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, creating a non-necess travel to COVID-19 outbreak sites, developing emergency communication programmes, including forums to answer staff issues, providing staff with additional educational and training on risk factors and protective behaviour, providing protective clothing and protective equipment for staff personnel, training for protective clothing and protective equipment, providing training for protective clothing and protective equipment, providing training for the use of protective clothing and protective equipment, providing training for the use of protective clothing and protective equipment, and providing training to improve personal hygiene resources and environmental protection requirements, including personal protection and protection requirements.
Such staff members better need respirators.
If someone is sick on the plane, there should be appropriate to protect staff and other passengers, including the arrangement of the patient to 6 feet away from other passengers, designated a crew member to serve the patient, provide masks to the patient, or require patients to cover their mouths while coughing or sneeze.
The crew should wear one-time medical gloves in the care of sick travellers, touch fluid or potential contaminated surfaces. If the sick travellers have symptoms such as heat, continuous coughing or breathing difficulties, the crew should also wear additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other one-time items should be treated in biological hazard bags and should then be cleaned and disinfected on contaminated surfaces. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk control measures also include delayed travel during illness. If heat or other symptoms on board, self-separation and immediately notify the medical room on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up visits should be conducted in the isolated room. For schools and childcare sites, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommends that, regardless of the community's proliferation, the corresponding school and childcare sites will be closed for a short term, clean or disinfected.
Social distance strategies can be implemented for low- and medium- and medium-level community dissemination, such as the elimination of field visits, gatherings and sports classes, choirs or cafeteria meals, increasing distance between desks, wrong peaks and departures, limiting unnecessary visitors ' visits and separate health offices for children with influenza symptoms.
If the community spreads seriously, in addition to social distance strategies, consideration can be considered to extend the time of suspension. For law enforcement personnel implementing routine activities, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control considers to face a lower direct health risk.
It is recommended that contact patients or suspected individuals must be exposed to the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including with appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during the arrest, staff members should clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment before they can use domestic cleaning spray or rag cleaning and re-use and should comply with standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures and clothing seals and cleaning procedures.
OSHA considers that certain health care and housing staff are at high or very high exposure risks.
High-exposure risk staff include physical access to health care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff who are actually exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 infected persons.
The exposure risk becomes extremely high if staff members perform foam generation procedures for known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collect or process the infected or suspected infected person.
The foam generation program includes intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchial mirrors, some dental procedures and inspections, or body cavity specimen collection.
High-exposure risk morgue staff include staff involved in the collation of the body of the deceased, which were diagnosed or suspected cases of COVID-19; exposure risks are higher if an autopsy is performed. Additional engineering measures for this risk group also include quarantine rooms prepared for COVID-19 confirmed or suspected cases, including in the implementation of the foam generation process.
Some health care facilities and morgue can also be equipped with specialized negative pressure ventilation systems.
Biosafety level 3 preventive measures should be taken when dealing with specimens.
The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends that different waiting areas for patients, depending on whether the patient is suspected of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Authority recommends that persons working within a 6-foot range of persons known or suspected of having infected SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform the foam generation program to wear respirators.
The United States requires the use of N95 filters or better masks approved by NIOSH in a comprehensive respiratory protection environment such as health testing, training, medical examinations, etc.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve staff comfort. WHO does not recommend protective clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not transmitted through body fluids.
WHO suggests that the entry point screening staff only wear medical surgical masks.
For staff who need to collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services for patients without having to perform the foam generation program, WHO recommends that it use medical surgical masks, goggles or masks, robes and gloves.
If you want to perform the foam generation program, the medical surgical mask must be replaced with N95 or FFP2 masks.
Given the lack of supply of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends that direct care personnel enter the rooms of COVID-19 patients only through physical barriers such as telemedicine, transparent windows, and to reduce the need for personal protective equipment only when specific tasks are indeed necessary to use personal protective equipment and continue to use the same respirators, monitoring and coordination of personal protective equipment supply chains and those who do not encourage the use of masks without symptoms.

Since this month, we've had some difficult situations.
In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, we clearly felt the fate of all mankind, while recognizing our responsibility for each other.
We face unprecedented challenges, but we know that the best measures to address this challenge require people around the world to work together, work together and promote community-building, which is the core idea of Wikimedia.
All colleagues pass each other through e-mails, telephones and chats, which is a good proof of the extraordinaryness of our colleagues, and how fortunate we are working with you.
I'm grateful and proud to be colleagues with you.
Last week, someone appreciated our work.
They made me realize how meaningful this world can use Wikipedia at this moment, and it makes me realize that this key resource remains the symbolic power that people around the world.
Whether your work is responsible for website operations, pay payments or community security, Wikimedia's functioning is not working.
The world now needs information from Wikipedia more than ever.
At this stage, our work and even the way we work will have an important impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and the burden of colleagues, we will start making some important adjustments to our collaborative approach next week.
Modalities and schedule adjustments
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night and discussed the way the company worked for the next few days to months.
At the meeting, we considered the appropriate response to the challenges we believe in to face the company and to ensure that companies maintain sustainable development during the epidemic.
The executive team agreed to reduce pressure for the company's employees so that you can support the company's mission for a long time.
We support your proper mitigation of the pressure.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours a week) and subsequent changes will be notified.
If you can work longer every day, we'll arrange your mission according to your work.
But given that the current world situation is unpredictable, we will give priority to your personal needs, such as family care, shopping or medical visits.
We're not following your working hours.
If you're sick, put down your job.
It's self-evident, but we still want to remind you, please don't worry.
You do not need sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team modify the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan, the talent and cultural operations department, which will support you and ensure that your situation is well received from management.)
We'll pay the full pay for the hourly employee.
We have already expressed our commitment to contractors and hourly colleagues again.
The pay we pay to all will continue to be calculated according to the remuneration they receive for the normal completion of normal working hours.
Even if you're sick or you can't work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through their work and release their pressure.
Our work can bring incredible returns, especially in times like this.
But taking care of yourself is still first.
We ask you to keep your communication with the manager so that we can get your update and make adjustments accordingly.
Priority to guarantee important work.
We have to keep some important work working.
The website reliability engineering team, human resources operations team, trust and security teams and fund-raising teams (and other teams) are essential, which may require additional support.
We will begin to assess current goals with all sectors and shift focus to some of the matters critical to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down will not affect future developments.
We're not going to work overtime after the epidemic.
We're not asking you to work overtime, because it seems unrealistic now.
We accept that the current environment has changed, and we will set new targets and timetables, as appropriate.
What will happen to the APP?
To adapt to new realistic and daily working hours requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule for the 2020-2021 plan.
We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for budgeting, enabling staff to prioritize critical work and take care of themselves and family; while adjusting work arrangements for employees who need or wish to reduce workload in the coming weeks.
The extension schedule can significantly reduce the current planned workload of the organization and reduce the pressure of work.
We'll make the above proposal to the Board next week. If the proposal is adopted, we will update the follow-up arrangements to delegates and teams as soon as possible.
Thank you for the leadership of the APP team.
Office status, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a San Francisco office colleague might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But for caution, we hired some anti-virus cleaners to completely disinfect the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-level disinfection solutions to disinfect the surfaces and the halls and elevators that lead to our floor.
The office building is fulfilling its obligation agreement to use the corresponding product to ensure the safety of tenants.
We believe that when you decide to return to work, the office is ready to meet you.
Our office in Washington, D.C. uses the WeWork office, WeWork shares COVID-19 agreements with us and all Washington, D.C. staff.
As of last week, Washington, D.C. had been transferred to a remote office in accordance with the guidance we shared with the San Francisco office.
Meanwhile, as some New York office colleagues already know, we've been discussing the rental of office sites in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue, but they may be delayed.
Some colleagues are in contact with remote office for the first time.
Other long-term tele-office colleagues wish to provide these colleagues with some suggestions for the modalities of adjustment:
The meeting time is suitable for control in one or two hours.
For longer, consider spreading the content of the meeting into multiple dates.
Clear determination of the objectives of the meeting, setting the agenda of the meeting and sending reading materials in advance.
Videoconferencing is used as a default meeting, while using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom for online collaboration and contact.
In each meeting, one host is organized to host the meeting, arrange for one person to monitor questions in chat windows and track changes in the list of speakers, arrange another person (or multi-person collaboration) to help make the meeting records.
If you need comfortable headphones, please send an e-mail to the technical support department.
Use your health allowance to buy snacks.
Add the commoties channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues
The Human Resources Operations Team is studying anthropo-engineering guidance in the form of a web seminar to help all colleagues in the form of the Foundation to improve the efficiency of work during distributed offices.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public activities funded by Wikimedia before WHO announced the end of the epidemic.
These requirements for lifting activities and other restrictions may result in the inability of these community recipients to complete the original contribution activities, and we have informed them that we understand and that no one of them will be punished for delay or modification of these goals.
In the next week, we will continue to provide more guidance at Wikimania and other regional community meetings and thematic community meetings.
The global community seems to be covering the grief caused by the outbreak, but also reflects the comfort of the ability to maintain its attention to their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT team will create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide communities with a space to monitor influence and track community exchanges.
Keep in touch and communicate with COVID-19-related issues
We plan to hold a special staff meeting at 14:00 next Thursday/07:00 (Pacific Time) and we will send an invitation to your calendar later.
At the meeting, we'll share some updates, answer your questions and leave some time for discussion.
We're united and we're here to help you.
At the same time, you can get more information on Office Wiki and other important information about COVID-19.
The CRT team will update these pages in time and concentrate all information.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries/regions currently affected by the epidemic.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, major workflows or insurance, or need other help, contact the CRT team and cooperate with them at any time.
We're here to provide you with the support and contact you need.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, head of the Global Human Resources Operations.
Although we face these changes, we cannot give up our work and obligations.
Instead, the epidemic has made us realize that we may need to adjust our work and obligations in a way that we have not had in the past.
We believe that these measures are necessary to support each other ' s continued completion of their work, provide the necessary support for our actions and continue to bring the services they depend on to the world.
Always plan, you can't be afraid of challenges.
Now, please support each other and create space for important work in the next few weeks or even months.
We need you to contribute to this goal, so please take care of ourselves and family so that you can be the best in need.
Finally, please remember to wash your hands and don't touch your face.
Katherine, CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) with other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2, ACE2 is an enzyme attached to the lung, artery, heart, kidney and intestinal surface (cell membrane).
ACE2 is expected to become a drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases by reducing the content of Ang (1-7) and increasing the content of Ang (1-7). ACE is also expected to become a drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point for certain coronary viruses entering the cell.
The human source version of this enzyme is commonly called hACE2.
Angiline conversion enzyme 2 is a zinc metal enzyme located on the inner skin cells and other cell surfaces.
ACE2 Protein contains a N-end enzyme M2 structural domain and a C-end Collecrin kidney amino acid trans-shipment protein area.
ACE2 is a single I-type membrane protein that is exposed to lung and other tissue cell surfaces.
Another enzyme, known as the stripase, releases the outer cell structure of ACE2 from the trans-film structure, the resulting soluble protein into the blood and eventually excretion to urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane, mainly lung type II lung bubble cells, intestinal skin cells in small intestines, most organs' artery and veins smooth muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in the cortex, texture, lower hill and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to balance ACE.
ACE deciphers the blood vessels stress I into an vascular constriction. II.
ACE2 Cracking vascular stress II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) phenylamino acid phenylpropamate and desolved it into angivascular tension (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also crack many other beryllium, including deprecision amino acid 9 slows, apelin, neuropressure, morphine A and stomach hunger.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of neutral amino acid trans-shipment protein SLC6A19 and is related to Hartnup.
As a cross-film protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronary viruses into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus leading to SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus leading to COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 sting protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 is combined with the enzyme structure of ACE2 on the surface of the cell, leading to internal swallowing, making viruses and enzymes in the nuclear inner body.
This entry process also requires the host silk acid protein enzyme TMPRSS2 to trigger the activation of S proteins and is currently studying whether the inhibition of the process can be a potential treatment. Some speculate that reducing the ACE2 levels in cells may help counter infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators recommend the continued use of standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic evaluation and analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group".
And, "For patients with higher risk of pneumonia, especially those in pawns and heart failure, the use of ACE inhibitor treatment also reduces the risk of pneumonia.
The use of ACE inhibitor is also related to reduced pneumonia-related mortality, but the result is less reliable as reducing overall pneumonia risk ... "
The reorganizer ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new way to treat acute lung damage, which seems to improve the acute respiratory distress syndrome indicator and blood oxygen saturation from the fat sugar.
rhACE2 half-life in the human body is about 10 hours, effective 30 minutes, and the active process (lasting) is 24 hours.
Some findings show that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients who are impatient or circulatory patients or circulators II levels. rhACE2 may be a promising drug. rhACE2 has been evaluated by clinical trials.
b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronary virus epidemic to help track close contacts and identify individuals who may have been exposed to infected persons ( "contacts").
Some regions and jurisdictions have developed or proposed many applications with the support of official Governments.
Many frameworks for building close-contact tracking applications have been established.
Privacy issues also raise multiple concerns, especially some systems need to track the geographical location of application users.
Low-intrusive alternatives include the use of bluetooth signals to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that this functionality to support Bluetooth applications will be directly integrated into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government has developed an application with the payment treasure to support citizens to check their own contact with COVID-19 patients.
The program is currently used in over 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an application called TraceTogether.
This application was developed by local IT communities as open source software and will be transferred to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based application, "StopKorona!" to track exposure to potential infected people and help medical institutions respond quickly.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications Technology and the Ministry of Health of Northern Macedonia.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the Government announced that close contacts tracking applications had entered the advanced development phase and will be operational in the coming weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch similar applications ( "StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering developing similar applications based on the TraceTogether application and BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geographical fence application for patients living in Moscow to ensure that patients do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering, Cambridge University, listed some of the practical problems that may exist in the application system, including false positive misreports, and if only a small proportion of the population uses the application, it may lack effectiveness.
In order to eliminate the spread of misleading or harmful "capable virus" applications, apples set restrictions on the organizational type of organization that can publish coronary viruses-related applications in Apple Applications, i.e. limited to "official" or other well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders claim that the large-scale surveillance of the use of coronary virus applications, particularly after the elimination of the epidemic, the surveillance infrastructure built to respond to the coronary virus epidemic.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
These organizations announced eight conditions to be met by government projects:
Surveillance must be "legal, necessary and nominal";
Monitoring and surveillance extensions must have a sunset clause;
Data collected are limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected and evidence that it is effectively protected;
Digital surveillance must avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing with third parties shall be defined by law;
(b) Safeguards must be provided to prevent data abuse and provide citizens with the right to respond to data abuse;
All "related stakeholders" "real participation", including the involvement of public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CC) and the Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also issued verification lists.
Google/Apple proposal is designed to solve the problem of continuous surveillance and remove it from the equipment operating system once no longer needs to be tracked.
Some countries use web-based rather than application location tracking, and users do not need to download applications, while avoiding tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Web solutions that access original location data may have serious privacy problems.
However, not all systems with self-contained central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that use central servers to communicate with each other have been created (see below for details).
Korea has launched a system that is not based on applications to perform contact tracking tasks.
The system does not use specialized applications, but rather choose to collect tracking information from various sources, including mobile devices tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combine it to send notifications to potential infected persons through text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the Government has been authorized to disclose location information, as the country has made significant adjustments to information privacy laws after the outbreak of the MERS outbreak.
The public can access this information through many applications and websites. There are countries, including Germany, considering the simultaneous use of centralized systems and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not been published.
Privacy protection close contact tracking is a recognized concept with a large number of relevant research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than 10 expert groups were studying privacy protection solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth low power (BLE) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
PEPP-PT is a coordination programme containing centralized and decentralized methods, not a single agreement. Dispersive agreements contain decentralized privacy protection adjacent tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, originally known as contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitive agreements and mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PPT) etc.
Under these agreements, identified personal data will never leave the device, and all matches are performed on the device.
The privacy team of the MIT Media Laboratory has been developing the SafePaths platform that uses privacy protection techniques when collecting and using cross-data of location or path.
The platform is based on the development of the White Paper on Application Debitrization: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic, released in March 2020. In addition, an company that initially created and worked at the MIT Media Laboratory and dedicated to developing privacy technology, Enigma MPC, is developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.

Launching tools to support government creation of official coronary virus tracking applications that protect privacy
Direct integration of this function into iOS and Andre systems, Google and Apple plan to launch the system first through the operating system update, and the epidemic will be removed in the same way by removing the system in the same way.
b Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, reevaluation, redistribution or treatment conversion) means the conversion of an approved drug to other uses to treat diseases or medical conditions different from their initial research and development purposes.
This is a scientific route currently being conducted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and recovery plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be used for pharmaceuticals, each with multiple formulations.
Analysis of these combinations provides a reasonable solution to the development of effective anti-virus drugs for COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include papaya sample protein enzymes, RNA Dependency RNA polymerases, decomposition enzymes, S proteins and ADP nucleic sugar diphosphate enzymes.

The World Health Organization has incorporated Lopinawe/Litonavi into the International Solidarity Test.
Redsywe is a drug created and developed by Gilid Science to treat Ebola and Marburg virus infections. Gilid Science later found that Redsiway was in vitro against multiple silk viruses, pneumonia viruses, bygly and coronary viruses.
One of the problems with anti-virus treatment is that resistance from mutation could lead to more serious diseases and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies have shown that Redsywe may have higher resistance genetic barriers. Many clinical trials are currently under way, two of which are being carried out by Cleveland University Hospital; one for patients with moderate symptoms and the other for more symptoms.
Three vitamin C veins are currently under way for patients with hospital severe illness; two placebo control tests (China, Canada) and a non-symmetric test (Italy).

b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine for 2019 coronary virus diseases (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine to complete clinical trials, the various attempts to develop this vaccine are still ongoing.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it would not occur in 18 months of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, five candidate vaccines entered the I security study.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
In 2020, a massive epidemic spread globally triggered a large number of investment and research activities in the development of vaccines.
Many organizations are using the released virus genome to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
CEPI introduced vaccine development plans in April and indicated that the priority was speed, productive capacity, large-scale deployment and global accessibility.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, 10 different technical platforms were studying and developing effective COVID-19 vaccines.
The main platform targets for entering the I security study include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus carrier (I-phase developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 gland virus carrier)
CEPI scientists reported in April that a total of 115 candidate vaccines were in the early stages of development, 78 of which had been identified as ongoing projects (79 according to data from the Millken Institute), and 37 had been announced, but almost no public information (prospecting is being planned or designed).
The I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immune tests, usually random, placebo contrasts multiple points, while identifying more accurate and effective doses.
The III test usually involves more participants, including control groups and tests the effectiveness of vaccine prevention diseases while monitoring adverse effects at the best dose.
In 79 candidate vaccines actively developed (confirmation time as of early April 2020), 74 were not subject to human evaluations (mainly pre-clinical study).
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia announced that the potential of a molecular plier vaccine was being studied, which could be genetically modified to stimulate immune response.
On about January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada (VIDO-InterVac) announced the beginning of the development of vaccines, with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.

On 19 March 2020, in France, the Alliance for Epidemiological Innovation (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million, establishing a COVID-19 vaccine research union consisting of the Basde Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and Pittsburgh University, which led the total investment of CEPI in COVID-19 vaccine development to $29 million.
CEPI other investment partners in COVID-19 vaccine development include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial Institute of Technology in London announced on March 20, 2020 that a self-enhanced RNA vaccine for COVID-19 was being developed.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of the virus sequence released in China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced an allocation of $275 million to finance 96 medical response research projects for COVID-19, including numerous candidate vaccines from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University programmes.
At about the same time, the Government of Canada announced that it would invest $192 million in the development of COVID-19 vaccines and plans to establish a national vaccine, including several new vaccines, so that these vaccines could be put into use when the coronary virus outbreak was re-emerged.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported a test of PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine that could be used for mice and called "the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sub-unit vaccine provided by MNA could enable [rats] to produce a strong antigenic antibodies reaction, which began to appear two weeks after immunization".
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo College of Medicine, Canada, announced the design of a DNA-based candidate vaccine as a possible nose spray.
Researchers use the fungus to design DNA to copy inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus samples, which could stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities focused resources and combined cloud computing resources from Hewlett-Packard, Amazon, Microsoft and Google to access IBM supercomputers.
Some vaccines have an alien effect, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that, in addition to disease prevention, they can bring other benefits.
Further random tests in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health care personnel.
The vaccine in development may be unsafe or invalid.
Early studies on the use of COVID-19 specific animal models such as ACE2 genetically modified mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates to assess vaccine effectiveness show that biosafety 3 measures are needed to deal with active viruses and international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines for SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there was no SARS treatment or preventive vaccine for human safety and effectiveness.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS were identified and developed as a priority for Governments and public health institutions in the world. Moreover, there is no effective vaccine for MERS.
In the MERS epidemic, it is believed that existing SARS research can provide useful templates for the development of vaccines and therapy for MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, one (based on DNA) MERS vaccine had completed the I issue of human clinical trials, and three other vaccines were being developed, all of which were virus carriers, two were gland virus carriers vaccine (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), one of which was MVA carrier vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media articles have contributed to conspiracy theory, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and already available.
The patents cited in social media articles refer to other coronary viruses (e.g. SARS coronary virus) genetic sequences and vaccines.
2019 Coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include heat, cough and air.
Other symptoms may include power, muscle acid, diarrhoea, pain, smell loss and abdominal pain.
The insulation period from exposure to the disease is 2-14 days, usually about 5 days.
Although most cases have minor symptoms, some cases develop into viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, the total number of cases reported in 210 countries and territories worldwide exceeded 2.24 million and more than 153,000 deaths.
There are currently over 568,000 people recovered. The virus spreads mainly through close contact between people, often by cough, sneeze or talking.
Although the exhalation produces foam, the foam usually falls on the ground or on the surface of objects, and does not cause remote transmission.
Besides, if someone touches the surface contaminated with the virus and then touch his nose and nose, it could be infected.
The virus survives for 72 hours on the surface of the object.
Although pre- and later recovery may be transmitted, the standard diagnostic method is the most contagious three days before the disease. The standard diagnostic method is to conduct a real-time retroverting polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test.
It's recommended that the suspected virus infection and their nursing staff wear masks.
The advice on public masks varies from place, some authorities are opposed to wearing masks and others have requested masks.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine or special effects anti-virus treatment programme.
Most of the six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms, or suspected influenza symptoms, such as heat, coughing, weak and aggressive.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory difficulties, continuous chest pain or chest distress, vague consciousness, difficulty of soberness and youth on the face or lips; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended for immediate medical treatment.
A few cases may be accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as sneeze, snot or throat pain.
There are also a different proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as disgusting, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Some Chinese cases have only symptoms of chest and heart attack at the beginning.
Some cases could develop into viral pneumonia, multi-organ failure, even death.
We call it a submersible period.
COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may be extended to 2-14 days.
97.5% of infected persons have symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The report states that not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of people who are not symptoms infected in the spread of the epidemic has not yet been fully clear; however, preliminary evidence suggests that people who are not infected with symptoms may contribute to the spread of diseases.
The Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of the confirmed cases did not show any symptoms during the hospital.
The China National Health and Health Commission has included symptoms in daily briefings as of 1 April; 130 (78%) of 166 infected persons on that date have no symptoms at the time of testing.
The slurry and saliva can carry a lot of viruses.
Speak louder than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that the non-covered cough could lead to the most distant spread of the foam of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although such viruses are generally not transmitted through air, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States has determined that the virus RNA positive samples are detected by air collectors outside the ward.
Medical procedures such as intubation and CPR may fog respiratory genres and thus cause air transmission.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through excreta, but the risk is considered to be low. When the patient has symptoms, the virus is most contagious; despite the potential to spread before symptoms, it is low risk.
The European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) states that while the transmission of the new coronary virus is not fully clear, the general person will transmit 2-3 people. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface of the object.
Specifically, the new coronary virus is known to survive a day on cardboard, survives for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), with up to four hours on 99% pure copper products.
But its survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.
If used correctly, soap and cleaners can also be used to the effects of the virus. Soap products can degrad the fat protection layer of the virus, and remove the virus from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as ammonium phenylzachlor and chlorthine glucose acid (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China, shows that saliva samples are collected on average two days after admission.
The first sample of patients in 5/6 has the highest load of the virus, with the highest number of viruses detected the next day by the patient.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus, first separated from three cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are presented in the relevant coronary virus in nature.
Before the virus does not enter the human body, it can be destroyed by domestic soap because soap can destroy the virus's protective cyst. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs of COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells through angiological stress enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the highest in the lung type II lung bubble cell.
The virus combines and enters host cells through a special surface sugar protein called "Standing Particle" with ACE2.
Of the patients treated in Wuhan Hospital in China, 12% of the infected found acute heart muscle damage, with a higher proportion of serious patients.
The deterioration of the disease causes a whole body inflammation and immune system disorders, with high incidence of cardiovascular symptoms, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the heart's ACE2 receptor.
ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in the heart and is involved in the regulation of heart function.
According to the information received, the blood bolts of the ICU-guarded COVID-19 infected persons (31%) and the vein embolism (25%) have a high incidence and may be associated with pre-preceivation. COVID-19.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a hobby for the upper skin cells that express ACE2, COVID-19 has a full-body overinflammation reaction.
In particular, the disease of GM-CSF in COVID-19 patients is associated with the collection of inflammation IL-6 circulatory mononuclear cells and severe lung pathology.
The autopsy report is also in lymphoma cells.
WHO has published several disease testing programs.
The standard test method is to use real-time reverse polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test usually detects respiratory samples obtained through noses; however, nostrils or slurry samples can also be used.
Normally, it's a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be conducted, but it takes two weeks apart from blood samples, and the result is almost non-current.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate the coronary virus strain and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect reagents and to detect infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibodies (not only active infections can be detected, but also to detect whether individuals have been infected in the past) are still under development, but have not yet been extended.
According to China's experience, the test accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the United States FDA approved the first instant diagnostic reagent and was operational at the end of the month. The diagnostic guide issued by Wuhan University Central South Hospital proposed methods for detection of infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Early infections are mostly seen in double lung multi-leaf glass, with external asymmetric and back parts.
As the virus develops, there may be visible under the chest, the shredding of the rock road (with a different degree of lung bubbles) and lung real change.
Very little information on COVID-19 micropathological damage and pathology.
The main pathology found in the autopsy is as follows:
Meat eye examination: cystitis, heart-packitis, lung real change and lung oedema
Four serious levels of viral pneumonia were observed:
Light pneumonia: lung oedema, lung cell growth, large number of atypical lung cells, inter-inflammation with lymphoma cells and formation of multi-nuclear giant cells
Heavy pneumonia: convulsive lung bubble damage (DAD) with a convulsive lung bubble seepage fluid.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe low oxygen blood disease.
Recovery of pneumonia: lung bubble cavity seepage liquid motorization and inter-pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: dispersive internal condensed blood (DIC); white-child red cell reaction
Preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the probability of infection, including: stay home; avoid entering dense areas of the population; frequent handwashing with soap and water and at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory sanitation; avoiding touching eyes, noses or mouths without handwashing.
The CDC recommends that paper towels be covered in paper towels when coughing or sneezes; if there is no paper towel, it is recommended to use the inside side of the elbow.
It's recommended to clean hands after cough or sneeze.
The CDC recommends wearing a mask in public to prevent the spread of viruses by patients without symptoms. The core of the social distance strategy is to close schools and workplaces, limiting travel and removing large public gatherings, thereby reducing access to infected persons with large groups.
In addition, the social distance guidelines provide for at least 6 feet (1.8 m) distance in interpersonal interaction.
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Given that the vaccine is expected to be developed by 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic is key to controlling COVID-19 transmission, which we know.
Meanwhile, the CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially when there are visible stains after the toilet or hand, before dinner and snot, cough or sneeze.
In addition, it is recommended to use alcohol-containing handwashing fluids, but only when there are no soap and tap water around them. For areas where water-free handwashing is not purchased, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropanol.
Use hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not "hand disinfection active matter".
Add glycerine as a wetting agent.
Supportive care for people, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and other affected vital organ support.
The CDC recommends that the suspect carrier wear a simple mask.
The external membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to mitigate respiratory failure symptoms, but its benefits remain to be studied.
It is recommended to maintain hygiene and promote healthy lifestyles and eating habits, thereby increasing immunity.
Support for early minor diseases may be effective. WHO and the China National Health Committee have launched initiatives calling for proper care for COVID-19 patients who are admitted to the hospital.
American intensive pathology experts and lung experts have compiled the treatment recommendations from institutions and are available free of charge through IBCC.
As of April 2020, COVID-19 special effects therapy was not developed.
In response to certain symptoms, some medical experts recommend a first-line treatment for the use of cynic pain (for acetaminophenol) to replace Broven.
Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus and to complete the operation of possible aerosols in a medical environment, such as intubation or hand-to-hand protection.
For medical personnel for patients in the care of COVID-19, the CDC recommends that, in addition to standard preventive measures, exposure precautions and air transmission precautions should be transferred to the air-transmitting infectious disease isolation room (AIIR). The CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the epidemic.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 Masks are allowed to be used in industrial settings, but the FDA has been authorized to use this mask under the urgent use authorization (EUA).
It is used mainly to prevent inhalation of suspended particles (e.g. dust), but it cannot ensure effective isolation of specific biological agents when used for other uses.
If there's no mask, the CDC recommends that the mask be used, and if necessary, you can wear a homemade mask.
Most COVID-19 cases are less symptoms and do not require mechanical ventilation or other options, but a proportion of cases require such measures.
Medical personnel are actively studying and hopes to provide respiratory support for COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure symptoms. There is evidence that high-flow oxygen treatment or double-phase gas pressure can avoid intubation.
It is not clear whether the two treatments can be equally effective for severe patients.
If conditions allow, some doctors tend to use mechanical ventilation, as compared to high-flow oxygen treatment, which also limits the spread of aerosol particles. Serious cases are dominated by older persons (over 60 years of age, especially older persons over 80 years of age).
The number of beds per capita per capita in many developed countries, given the restrictions on medical conditions, the medical system cannot cope with the serious situation that requires admission to hospital due to the surge in COVID-19 cases.
A study in China found that 5% of patients need to be sent to intensive care, 2.3% of patients need mechanical air and 1.4% of patients will die.
About 30% of COVID-19 patients in China were eventually sent to the ICU.
With the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the complexity of mechanical ventilation has increased, and the oxygen is becoming more difficult.
At that time, the breathing machine that supports pressure control and high PEP is required to maximize oxygen transport, while minimizing the risk of lung damage and chest caused by the breathing machine.
The old respirator may not be able to achieve high PEP.
Since January 2020, potential therapy has been studied, and several anti-virus drugs have now entered the clinical trial phase.
Redsyway seems to be the most promising drug at the moment.
Although it may not be developed until 2021, several drugs tested have been approved for other purposes or have entered the advanced testing phase.
Patients with severe illness can try to use anti-virus drugs.
WHO calls on a wide range of volunteers to participate in potential therapy effectiveness and safety tests. FDA has temporarily authorized the recovery of plasma blood transfusions as experimental treatment to treat patients with severe life risk.
The necessary clinical study has not yet been conducted to prove whether the treatment is safe and effective.
In February 2020, China released a mobile application to curb the outbreak.
Users need to enter names and ID numbers as required.
This application can judge the risk of potential infection by monitoring data testing "quick contact".
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
Once potential risks are detected, the application will not only recommend self-separation, but also alerts to local health officials. Integrated application of mobile phone data analysis, facial recognition techniques, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence, tracking infected persons and their contacts in Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government approved security agencies to track mobile phone data for suspected coronary virus carriers.
The purpose of this measure is to enforce isolation and protect groups that may be exposed to citizens infected.
Also in March 2020, German Telecommunications shared a summary of mobile phone location data with the German Federal Government Agency Robert Koh Institute to study and prevent the proliferation of viruses.
Russia deploys facial recognition techniques to detect personnel violations of isolation.
According to the Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera, mobile phone operator data show that 40% of citizens are still moving around.
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hacker marathon with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronary viruses on a global scale.
Segregation, travel restrictions, treatment of side effects or fear of self-infection, all of which could be disturbing.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connell, "Social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic instability is a perfect storm that hurts people's mental health and well-being."
The disease is more mild, and the symptoms are rarely not even symptoms, similar to other ordinary upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds.
Light cases usually recover within two weeks, while cases of severe illness or severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
According to other similar viruses (e.g. SARS and MERS), pregnant women are at high risk of developing into COVID-19 severe patients, but lack of COVID-19 data support. COVID-19 may have an impact on the lungs of some people, thereby causing pneumonia.
In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which leads to respiratory failure, blood loss or multi-organ function failure.
COVID-19 Related complications include sepsis, condensation anomalies, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
6% of COVID-19 patients in hospital have condensation anomalies, especially the time of the condensation enzyme, while 4% of patients in the group have kidney abnormality.
About 20-30% of COVID-19 patient liver enzyme (turnase) rises.
According to the same report, the average time from disease to death was 10 days, of which the average time of hospitalization was five days.
But the average time for patients transferred to ICU to death is seven days.
Early case studies found that the average time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total time range of 6 to 41 days.
A study by the China National Health and Health Commission (NHC) found that the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
The autopsy of the lung sample tissue pathology shows that there is a hyper-pulmonary lung bubble damage with cell fibres.
Lung cells observe viral cell disorders.
Lung images are similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health and Health Commission in China caused heart damage due to rising calcium protein levels or heart arrest.
According to data released in March in the United States, 89% of patients in hospital have a history of old illness. Medical resource supply and regional socio-economic conditions may also affect mortality rates.
Given regional differences and methodological difficulties, the estimates of disease mortality vary.
Underestimation of minor cases could lead to overestimate mortality.
But if the death of the case is due to the previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times higher than those with severe COVID-19, and the probability of severe care or death is about 2.4 times higher.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority of China found that the lung activity of some rehabilitations fell by 20 to 30 per cent, and lung scans showed organ damage.
In addition, post-rehabilitation syndrome may be faced after rehabilitation.
As of March 2020, it was not clear whether the old infection could enable rehabilitations to effectively long-impact immunization.
According to the behavioral characteristics of other coronary viruses, it may have been immune, but there are reports that the coronary virus test was positive shortly after the recovery of some COVID-19 cases.
These cases are considered to be deteriorating, not re-infection.
The virus is considered a natural virus, which originated in animals, by spilling infection.
The actual origin has not yet been determined, but as of December 2019, the infection range was almost all human transmission.
The first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases published in January 2020 show that the first date of the disease was December 1, 2019.
The first date of the WHO official publication reported was December 8, 2019.
There are usually several methods to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to time, and are affected by detection, health system quality, treatment programmes, first outbreak time and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO designated the ICD-10 Emergency Disease Code U07.1 to the laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases of death, assigned U07.2 to clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 but not diagnosed in the laboratory. Death rate equals the total number of deaths within the given time range by the total number of confirmed cases.
According to John Hopkins University statistics, as of 17 April 2020, the global rate of death was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infected mortality (IFR), which reflect the percentage of the number of sick deaths as a percentage of the number of confirmed deaths, which reflect the number of sick deaths as a percentage of the number of infected (including diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These statistics have no time limits and tracks the entire process of the specific population from infection to case.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies provides information on the number of infections.
The Italian Epidemic Center, Castigliane d'Adda, is a small town with a population of 4600 people, and now 80 people (1.7%) died of the epidemic.
In Gangelt, the epidemic spreads through various carnival festivals, even young people, but the mortality rate is relatively low, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.
Besides, the German medical system is overburdened.
According to blood donors, about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.
To date, 69 people (0.004%) of the total population have been confirmed to die of COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and mortality vary according to sex.
Studies in China and Italy show that men have higher mortality rates than women.
Men aged 50-60 have the highest risk of death, with a similar gender gap in the 90-year-old age group.
The male mortality rate in China was 2.8% and the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
The exact reason for this gender difference is unclear, but may be caused by genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-based immunology differences, low female smoking rates, men with complications (e.g. hypertension) below women, resulting in male mortality rates higher than women.
In Europe, men account for 57% and 72% of the total number of deaths due to COVID-19.
As of April 2020, the United States Government had not tracked gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on men and women.
The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is high and the chances of exposure to viruses are also high.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease "COVID-19".
The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained this: CO represents "capture", VI for "virus", D for "disease", 19 for the first outbreak of the epidemic (31 December 2019).
The name was chosen to avoid the reference of specific geographical locations (e.g. China), animal species or population to meet the international naming proposal to prevent stigmatization. The virus that triggered COVID-19 was called Serious acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Besides, WHO is using the "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus that triggers COVID-19".
Diseases and viruses are commonly called the coronary virus.
During the first outbreak of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was widely referred to as "capable virus" and "Wuhan coronary virus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases be used as temporary viruses and disease names, according to the 2015 guide on the use of location in disease and virus names.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limits of the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers have begun to print health care materials such as noses and respirator components.
For example, an Italian hospital needs a ventilator valve, and suppliers cannot deliver components within the required time, a local start-up company for reverse works, printing 100 ventilation valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theory on the origin of the disease, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects, false information and false information, spread rapidly through the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
Research on evidence of virus reproduction in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines for the treatment of this disease have not yet been approved.
Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively conducting international research to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the Solidarity Test to assess the treatment of four existing anti-virus compounds that are most likely to produce therapeutic effects.
There are no vaccines yet, but institutions at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Since SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells through ACE2 receptor, the previous results of SARS-CoV need to be used.
People are studying three vaccine strategies.
First, researchers plan to develop a virus vaccine.
Using such viruses, whether inactive or death viruses, are designed to provoke rapid immune reactions to the human body when new COVID-19 is infected.
The second strategy is to develop sub-unit vaccines designed to develop a vaccine that stimulates a sensitive response to certain sub-units of the immune system.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, such studies focus on the S sting protein of the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is to develop a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA vaccine or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine development technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the pilot vaccines developed by the above-mentioned strategies must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched the first vaccine clinical trial.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic sequences from the virus that causes disease. It has been believed that antibodies can be a major challenge in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials were carried out.
Seven tests completed the assessment and were approved for treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydrochlor or chlorquine.
The conversion of anti-virus drugs accounts for the vast majority of Chinese research, and nine clinical trials on Redsiway will be conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and candidate drugs had been initiated. Several existing anti-virus drugs for COVID-19 are currently being assessed, including Redside, chlor and hydrochlorine, Lopinave/Litonawe and Lopinave/Litonawe combination jamming beta.
By March 2020, Redswe's efficacy had been initially confirmed.
It was observed that clinical symptoms of patients treated with compassion, Redswey, have been reduced.
At this stage, the United States, China and Italy are conducting a third clinical trial. In February 2020, China launched a study of chlorquine (for the past to treat malaria) and achieve preliminary results.
However, there was a call for peer review of the study.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorpium.
But the Wuhan Institute of Virusology suggested taking 1 grams a day, while reminding twice the dose that it could even be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for chlorquine and hydrochlorine, but doctors have the right to decide whether to use the two drugs to treat COVID-19 patients. China's seventh edition also proposed the use of jamming, Libavilin or Abidore treatment for COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of Libavilin are inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
After confirming the low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, further internal research is recommended using nitronet. Studies show that the original sting protein caused by transfilm protein 2 (TMPRSS2) is a necessary condition for SARS-CoV-2 to interact with ACE2 receptor.
Whether or not used in conjunction with Archicin, there are serious limitations in the chlorquine and hydrochlorine studies, and the medical community is unable to receive these treatments unless further studied. Ostaway did not contain SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and have not yet found therapeutic effects on COVID-19.
Cell factor storm could be a complications for later treatment for COVID-19 patients.
There is evidence that hydrochlorine may have anti-cell factor storm properties. After completing a small study, the China National Health and Health Commission has included a single resistance to the treatment guide.
After the positive results of the patient with severe illness, Italy is conducting a non-random test at the national level.
Combined with serum protein blood testing, identifying cell factor storms, designed to contain the development of the disease, while cell factor storms are considered to cause the death of some infected persons.
In 2017, with the support of a review case study, the FDA approved the use of white cell media 6 receptor resistance to the release syndrome for other causes of steroids, i.e. CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there has been no random control evidence that the beads are resistant to effective treatment.
The extraction of pure enrichment antibodies generated by the COVID-19 rehabilitation system is being injected into people who need antibodies, as passive immunotherapy before the vaccine is successfully developed.
SARS tried this strategy during the outbreak, but the efficacy of the treatment was undetermined.
The virus and are an expected mechanism for the immune defence of SARS-CoV-2 in passive antibodies.
However, other mechanisms such as antibodies depend on cell toxicity and/or devouring effects can also achieve the same effect.
Other forms of passive antibodies are being developed, such as the use of artificial monoclon antibodies.
The serum generation during the rehabilitation period may increase and facilitate rapid deployment. The serum consists of the liquid part of the blood of the rehabilitation patient, which contains specific antibodies for the virus.
Coronary virus disease, a closely related syndrome
Dr. Li Wen-Lang, a hospital doctor in Wuhan, raised awareness of the spread of the new coronary virus, and then unfortunately got COVID-19 and died.
