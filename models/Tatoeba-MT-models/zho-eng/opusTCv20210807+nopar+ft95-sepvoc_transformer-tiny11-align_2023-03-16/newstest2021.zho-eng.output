Xinhua Time Review: Making a rural revitalization force - Xinhua Network
Rural revitalization, talent is the key.
Where do you find the talent?
The best group of farmers who return to the country is an indispensable force.
Xinhua, the commercial Haichun.
Xinhua Chengdu, July 26th.
The 34-year-old Zhang Hung family was in the Orchard village of Sichuan City, and in 2010 he resigned from Beijing's monthly pay home.
After years of fighting, he now earns more than a million dollars a year on grape-planted family farms, becoming a famous rich leader and was chosen to enter the village's "two-member" class.
In recent years, under the inspiration of a series of policy incentives such as the State's poverty eradication and rural revitalization, more and more farmers like Zhang Hung chose to go home and activate a pool of spring water in the countryside.
In the western province of the Western Population, Sichuan, the province of labour, has implemented the "good farmer workers' re-initiation project", and in 2019 alone, more than 8,000 of the village party clerks, raised 61,000 village backups, with more than 20,000 members of the Development Party, providing strong assurances to win the fight against poverty and the implementation of the rural revitalization strategy.
Kang is not a little girl. It's about the old country.
Since the reform and opening up, there have been a large number of young labour workers in rural areas, some of which have started their own business by fighting.
But objectively, it also led to a different degree of rural "emptiveness" in rural grass-roots organizations, where the village branch secretary and party team showed the "one-low" feature, age ageing, low education, low education, the weak leadership of the village organization, and the high-profile problem.
If the elements of rural talent have been going to the city alone, the countryside is in a state of "blood loss" "aemia" for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
Bring back farmers who are capable, conscious, interested in serving their homes, lead them to their home-grown business as a rich leader, to develop party members, rural cadres, to enrich grass-roots cadres, which are the cure for rural party teams and grass-roots organizations.
Good farmer workers can get back, and they're gonna keep them. Good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has been building from the Farmer Labour Party and has established institutional mechanisms such as a good farmer's job orientation, service security, training promotion, selection and use, so that they can improve their capacity, work security, life expectations, truly rooting in rural areas, and a sense of achievement for the entrepreneurship of officers.
This year is the year of the final battle against poverty, and talent is a key factor for the fight against poverty and rural revitalization.
The party council governments at all levels need to pay high priority to the group of workers who return to the country, and through integrated measures, creating a task force that can be left, cannot take away, to provide strong organizational security and talent support for rural escape from poverty and development.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates were a special time, and on the night of July 11th, the bilibili summer graduation song brought a special online live show to graduates, Wolf, Park Tree, Lee Woo Chun, Mao, and the musicians sing and bless their graduates.
The famous Pup master SealWu Wu Yifan also brought a wild grass, a rap song he created according to Lu Xian's essay collection, which was very popular among young people.
Because of the epidemic, a lot of graduates didn't feel the ritual of the field, and they moved the ritual sense of the ritual to the line.
The data shows that this 2.5-hour song, with a live human peak of over 35 million.
"Follow your heart, take advantage of the opportunity, and sometimes there are unexpected gains ... "
Although it's a graduation song, many songs move the non-receivable graduates.
"The whole scene really wants to cry, and everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it's worth remembering and walking on bravely. "

The capital's natural ecology continues to attract wildlife cities to settle.
Beijing wildlife has reached over 500 species.
The Beijing Youth Journal of the newspaper (Reporter Wang Bin) was informed from the City Garden Greening Bureau that the species and numbers of wildlife have continued to increase in recent years as the natural ecological environment in the capital continued.
Currently, the land-based vertebrate wildlife living in Beijing has increased to over 500 species, including the protection of animals at the national level, such as the blony chicken, black twilight, and the protection of animals at the national level, as well as antelope, swans, cranes, and so on.
Whether it's a city forest in the second ring, or the microwet between the buildings, not only brings nature to the people of the capital, but also to "settling" in the city.
The Summer Festival, a vibrant one in the Pine Mountain National Nature Reserve in the Yanshan Mountains in the north-west Yanqing district.
A twilight is playing around the mountains, and two dogs are playing with each other.
Back, a boar's "stabbing" on his body is trying to get a little bit of a tree. The Director of the Management of the National Nature Reserve of Pine Mountain, Hu Chili, introduced, by the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of 6,200 hectares, living in 178 wildlife, including the protection of animal gold sculptures and national level II protection of animal chickens, an antelope, where nearly one third of the wildlife species can be seen here.
"In Matsuyama, wildlife is the real master, and our staff can only be his bodyguard."
Hu Chili said that, in order to understand the situation of wildlife in the protected area, there are over 30 professional inspectors every day, following 16 well-designed protective routes, and there's a "turning circle" every month, almost all day to walk the entire protected area.
"In the course of the patrol, it is not just for the recording of biodiversity, but also to check the installation of artificial bird nests, rescue injured wildlife, installation of field infrared cameras, etc. "
The Matsuyama National Nature Reserve has now installed over 200 infrared cameras to record the living state of wildlife in the lower forest.
Huchili introduced that with the growing biodiversity of protected areas over the years, more and more wildlife have appeared in the camera, leopard cats, thoriums and pork have become "resident guests" and the national level of protection of animal antelopes is getting higher.
Zhang Chi Minh, Director of the Wildlife Plant and Wetlands Protection Service of the Beijing Garden Greening Bureau, has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 today, and the species and number of wildlife in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
Wildlife in cities is becoming more common, closely linked to the upgrading of cities in the capital city in recent years.
In particular, a new round of millions of acres of forest greening, which began in 2018, proposed to re-establish the urban ecological environment and enhance the ecological function of the forest green land and highlight the concept of "near nature".
Planning to interact with green surroundings, to facilitate wildlife "to visit friends" and grow trees like honey, food plants.
I'm committed to helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers talk about what they see and understand.
Given this scenario, a modern computer visual algorithm, you can tell you that there's a woman, and a dog.
It can tell you that woman is smiling.
It can even tell you, this dog is very cute.
I'm dealing with this, thinking about how humans understand and live with the world.
Those ideas, memories and stories in such a scene, may raise human attention.
Interconnection of all connections.
Maybe you've seen a dog like this before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this, and further inspires the memories and ideas of the past vacation, when you used to go to the beach, spend time with other dogs, running around.
One of my guiding principles, by helping computers understand what this is, to understand what we believe in and feeling, so we have the ability to start developing computer technology in a way that complements our experience.
So, deep digging this, I started working a few years ago to help computers produce stories like humans, from image sequences.
So one day, I was working on a computer, asking about its views on Australia's trip.
It looked at the picture, saw a tree bag bear.
It doesn't know what a bag bear is, but the computer means it thinks a bag bear looks like a funny creature.
And then I shared a series of images of the house burning with the computer.
The computer looked at the picture and it said, "It's an amazing view!
It colds my back.
Computers see a terrible, changing life and destroying life and thinks it's positive.
I realized that computers realized the comparison between red and yellow, and it was a matter of positive evaluation.
Partly because most of the computer I entered is positive images.
That's because people talk about their experiences, they tend to share positive images.
When was the last time you saw yourself at the funeral?
I realized that in improving artificial intelligence, it was a mission to the mission, data sets to data sets, and in computer understanding, creating huge gaps, defects and blind spots.
While doing this, I'm coded for all kinds of prejudice.
Prejudice reflects a limited view, and it comes from a data set -- which reflects the same human being, such as stereotypes and stereotypes.
I remember the development of that technology, and it brought me to the situation where I was in the day -- the first colored image was calibrated for a white woman's skin color, which means color photography is biased against the black face.
And the same deviation, the blind spot continues to bring into the '90s.
The same blind spot, even today, still in facial recognition applications, how to identify the faces of different people.
In today's research, I think of state-of-the-art technology, tend to limit our ideas to a data set and a problem.
And that we're creating more blind spots and prejudices, and we're being further magnified when using artificial intelligence.
And then I realized we had to think about how we invented the creation technology today, and how we'll be seen in five to ten years.
In human interaction with the environment, humans use time to correct the problem, so evolution is slow.
Artificial intelligence is developing at incredible speed.
It means it's really important, and we're going to think about it now -- reflect on our blind spots, and to consider how these prejudices affect the technology we create now, and discuss what today's technology means to the future.
CEOs and scientists, have balanced their ideas, about future artificial intelligence development.
Stephen Hawking warned: " Artificial intelligence will destroy humanity ... "
Elon Mask warned that it was a risk that we were as civilized society; one of the greatest risks to face.
Bill Gates says, "I don't understand why people are not more worried about artificial intelligence."
But these ideas -- just part of the story.
The math, the model, the basic components of these artificial intelligence, are all we can get and use.
We have open source tools to the public to learn machines, and make their own contributions at the same time.
Besides, we can share our experience.
We can share technology and its relationship with us, and how to make us jump.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, which may be more useful about technology, or more problems over time.
If we all focus on opening discussions on artificial intelligence looking forward, it will help create a regular conversation and consciousness, what can artificial intelligence be? And everything we need to do to achieve the best results we can do.
We've seen and understood this in the technology we used today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they good?
Yes, so are they.
They're not exactly the same.
You've seen the light of the future there.
The future will continue to start with what we build and create now.
We started the Domino bone effect, which revealed the evolution of artificial intelligence.
In our time, the artificial intelligence of tomorrow was shaped.
Let us be immersed in the technology that enhances reality, and bring the world back to life.
When people have difficulty communicating, technology helps them share their experiences.
Technology based on online visual media can be used on autopilot.
Technology produces language based on image understanding, and it becomes a technology that helps people with visual impairments, helping them better have a visual world.
We also see how technology causes some problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth -- like the color of our skin or the expression on our faces to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, processing data on gender or race to determine whether we can get a loan.
Everything we see now, just a snapshot of artificial intelligence evolution.
Because where we're in, it's a moment of evolution.
That means what we're doing now will affect the future of things, and to the future.
If we want artificial intelligence to help humans evolve, we need to set up strategies and targets, and open that path immediately.
What I want to see is the direction of culture and environment that suits humans.
Technology can help us cure neurosystem diseases or other disabled patients, and make life as challenging as everyone.
Technology's operation doesn't take into account your characteristics or skin color.
I'm concerned today about technology tomorrow and 10 years later,
Artificial intelligence can appear in many different ways.
But in this case, it's not a drone without any destination.
This is the car we can drive simultaneously.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.
We choose if we need to turn.
What would we choose about the future artificial intelligence?
There's a vast arena that allows artificial intelligence to be everything.
It'll become a lot of different things.
Now depends on what we need to do to ensure that artificial intelligence results are better for all humans.
Thank you.

Black Land "Specific" is modernizing agriculture - Xinhua Network
Xinhua Harbin, July 26th.
In the summer, two sprayed drug-jet aircraft ran over the 10,000 acres of high-yielding fields at the second operating station in Friendship Farm 5 management, forming two white lines, and the "first" of the green fields planted with black rice seedlings.
The chief of this station, the head of the station, said that this plane could spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, about eight times more efficient than the drone, hundreds of times the manual.
This farm is located in the country's first food-producing province of Friendship County, Heilongjiang Province, from the past "swipe" to the motor voice of the "Longlong" today, and China's traditional farming and farm has changed on this black earth belt.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in modern agricultural production on friendship farms.
On the one hand, on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precision fertilizer, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardized operations among agricultural machinery fields.
In this year's rice production, the farm extended the area of satellite navigation unmanned plug-in technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes seedlings more even, maximizing the use of sunlight and cropland resources, saving $16 per acre.
The farm has tried new technologies such as information, intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery base in the country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farm agricultural aircraft currently has 49,000 units (parts), with an integrated mechanization rate of 99.8 per cent.
Agricultural aircraft operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100 per cent precision in dry fields and 100% of the dry field motor vehicle operation.
" Green agriculture, intelligent agriculture, digital agriculture is the direction of agricultural modernization ... "
The mayor of the friendship farm, Liu Zhilian, said.
The key to agricultural modernization is technological progress.
The farm-based Heilong River Farming has been a model for modern agricultural carriers in recent years, leading the role of creating a modern agricultural industry system dominated by scale, standardized production and industrialization.
In the suburbs of Friendship County, there is a 350,000 square meters farm fair.
This is a concentration of over 140 agricultural equipment that has been introduced over the years of Heilong River Farming.
These agricultural equipment and farms have witnessed our agricultural modernization.
She's a small family for you, Anhui, and the people are moving straight to the crowd.

Xinhua journalist Chen Sang Camp, Wang Li Wu, Liu Shamura
On July 25th, more than 4:00 p.m., Fu Quinbao was wearing muddy rubber shoes, from the front house to the back house, and his wife Zhou Yan came back and forth and was busy packing.
"I'm still in the field when I got a call from the village cadres. "
Fu Quinba said he had turned over 60 acres of land, planted rice, and it was good right now, "He took the medicine yesterday, and the tools didn't clean up anything."
Fu Quinbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer in the corner, "No one wants to be flooded in the house, and the house is for everyone."
In response to the constant high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in the lake, the city of Fatty in Anhui Province is ready to launch the Jiangguchi River, where the Fukunbao family is located in 26th.
The Chiang Guo River Union is located in Fatxi County, near the dyke of the nest.
There are thousands of villagers involved in the town of Tsang and San River.
As at 1600 hours, our fifth largest freshwater lake nest level remained at a height of 13.2 metres, with a super-guaranted water level of 0.7 metres.
The Fu Quinbao kitchen is clean, there's a pumpkin head on the table, eggs and some halogens in the fridge.
"I didn't think I'd move. The water of Chiang Guo is now good."
Zhou Yan said the house was a flat room, and some big objects were not ready to put it.
" Pack up valuable items, refrigerators, televisions, and these large pieces can be placed in high-level neighbors or relatives' homes for a while. "
The village cadres have made a steady idea for Fu Kunbao.
Wang Li is in charge of the transfer of 13 villagers, one notice to confirm everyone's placement programme.
The nearest placement point from the Fukunbao family is a small school in the shop, about 2 km.
Besides the big ones, there's more than 1,000 pounds of food and new furniture that's got a headache for Fu Kunbao.
"The food is ready to drag to relatives' house, and the furniture can't be moved."
The couple talked about the stool under the new bed and raised the bed by about half a metre.
At 6:00 p.m., Fu Kunbao started shipping things to relatives with a tricycle, and Zhou Yan continued to pack up at home.
At 11:00 p.m., the couple looked before and after home, pulled the gate and was ready to set the point.
"I hope the water will return early."
Fu Quinbao said.
On July 26th, at 9:30 a.m., the press saw the site at the Jiangguchi River Union, and the locals were ready to split up.

Besides, Gick and Liu Xian, as sports assistants, have created a lot of laughs around sports teenagers.
The fire of the Church of Nante, France: the parish volunteers admitted to arson and the hyenas - China New Net
On July 26, the Chinese New Net, according to foreign media reports that on July 18th, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul's Cathedral, were severely damaged in a fire, and the cello organ was completely destroyed.
On 26th local time, Attorney Nant announced that a parish volunteer in the cathedral had been prosecuted for "arson destruction".
He's admitted that he lit a fire in the church.
According to reports, local prosecutor Seines said that the 39-year-old parish volunteers from Rwanda admitted that he lit fire in the cathedral at night.
The lawyer of this man said that the arsoners now regret doing this.
This man entered France by asylum a few years ago, sheltered in the parish of the fire and was taken in the church.
The prosecution noted that recently he tried to update his visa and were communicating with the police station.
But the church says it still can't believe that this is a very kind, smiling, but not a very good believer who talks will destroy a church he loves so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer was questioned by the police because of the logical problems that were described, but he was released.
The firemen are on the scene.
On the evening of 25th, as professional engineers at the Paris Central Police Laboratory lab obtained new evidence, the man was summoned again.
This time, the man admitted to his arson.
It was reported that if the crime of deliberately being destroyed, the suspect would face a 10-year imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to reports, the fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre and the St. Paul's Cathedral, and that the organ in the church was completely burned and the colored glass windows behind the organ were damaged.
Brune, the chief architect of the French historical protection building, believes that conservative estimates that it takes at least three years to recover at the Nant Cathedral.
Consolidated message: American unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries.
On the morning of 24 July, the Chinese Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China that China decided to withdraw the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and made specific requests for the termination of all operations and activities of the Consulate General.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralism measures taken by the United States have caused serious problems with relations between China and the United States, and that China responded to the unreasonable provocation of the United States, and that countermeasures were legitimate and necessary.
Andrés Bolx, Director of the China Research Centre, Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that unilateralism measures in the United States have undermined the bridge between the peoples of China and the United States and the two major countries in crisis.
China informed the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu as a counter-measure of unilateral measures in the United States, in line with diplomatic practice.
Professor of the Argentine Catholic University, Patricio Justo, Director of the Centre of the Centre for Research in Acheng, believes that China's decision is the legitimate and necessary countermeasures that were previously provocations in the United States, not against the ordinary American population.
The United States is trying to distract the American people by pressing China to cover up its weak response to the new coronary epidemic.
Banbun Suryno, President of the Asian Centre for Innovation Research in the Indonesian Think Tank, said that the United States had taken provocative diplomatic gestures that had caused serious problems for relations between the two countries and the two countries facing serious challenges.
China informed the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu as a normal countermeasures, in line with diplomatic practice, reflecting the principle of China’s firm defence of its own interests and reflects the reasonable and favourable rhythm of Chinese diplomacy.
The Tanzania current commentator Francis Semwinza said that China ' s decision was a legitimate and necessary response to American provocations.
The relationship between China and the United States should be re-established, and the United States should actively improve relations with China and stop interference in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to win economic and politically with China for the benefit of both peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, Executive Director of the Federation of Arab-China Friendship Associations, based in the Sudan, said that the countermeasures forced by China was a legitimate and necessary response to the American side, in line with the basic norms of international law and international relations and in line with diplomatic practice.
The United States had previously requested the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston to seriously violate the basic norms of international law and international relations.
I hope the United States will withdraw the previous decision and create the necessary conditions for normal relations between the two countries.
Singapore's Joint Morning Journal has published editorial that the larger strategic intentions in the United States are to block China and stop China from rising.
In the face of the American pace, China is very reluctant to see the relationship between China and the United States continue to deteriorate, but has to take countermeasures.

Hurricane Hannah landed in Mede or caused a river surge and a flood-middle network.
On July 26, the Central New Net, the combined external media reported that on 25 p.m. local time, Hurricane Hannah landed in Texas, United States, will cause storm rain, river surge, and could cause life-threatening floods.
The National Hurricane Center says that Hurricane Hannah is expected to hold heavy rains, sweeps over the southern and north-east parts of the state, rain or causing some stream surges and life-threatening flood.
According to reports, the most affected by Hurricane Hannah was the south of Copes Christie to the Grand River, and that the Rio Grande Valley could have a wide range of mountain floods.
The Governor of Texas, Abbot, said, "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
There are 32 counties in the state that are in a state of disaster emergency.
The city of Copes Christie, with a population of over 320,000, has closed libraries and museums, and residents are waiting.
Abbot also said that the hurricane could no longer bring more casualties to Texas as a new coronary outbreak is hit.
It is reported that precipitation in the southern part of Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches at night on 26 and 3 to 5 inches of rainfall in the northern part of Texas and the coastal areas of Louisiana.
With the impact of global warming, Hannah was formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
Normally, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually takes place until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European treaty to prevent violence against women
On Saturday, the Polish Ministry of Justice stated that Poland would take steps to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women next week.
According to the Polish right-wing government cabinet, the Treaty requires schools to teach students about gender issues and trample on the rights of students ' parents.
Polish Attorney General Jobro held a press conference that his Ministry of Justice would request to begin withdrawal from the Treaty on Monday to the Ministry of Labour and Family.
The treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
Jobro said, "The treaty contains elements of the form we think is harmful."
Polish ruling laws and the Justice Party and its partners of the ruling coalition have close alliances with the Roman Catholic Church, promoting conservative social agendas.
Polish President Duda used hostile rights as one of the main topics during the successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles (most of whom were women) held protests against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and some other cities.
One of the protesters of the protest, Lempat, said in a protest march in Warsaw, "The purpose of withdrawal is to legalize domestic violence."
Some protesters hold banners, which says, "The Law and Justice Party are the hell of women."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The previous government of Poland ' s middle office ratified the Convention in 2015.
The Government of the Law and Justice Party stated that the treaty does not respect religion and requires the teaching of liberal social policies in schools.
But the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention to date.

The Asian-European Economic Union, including Russia, has been able to move into the ASEAN market after signing a FTA with Viet Nam.
Grivori suggested maximizing the free trade zones between the Asian and European Economic Union and ASEAN countries, and thus create a platform for economic and security stability.
Grivori also believes that Russia, Vietnam and ASEAN are on track and will achieve their goals.
From now until the end of 2020, North Gang Province will have the necessary conditions, particularly in infrastructure, human resources and land, in order to actively bring foreign investment inflows, especially transnational groups with value chains and transfer of advanced technologies.
In addition, the North Gang Province will process the claim of the Government Prime Minister ' s decision to invest in infrastructure construction and operation projects in the Viet Korean industrial zone and approval to include two industrial-city-service areas in the province of Anshan-North and Anzhi to supplement the master plan for the development of the industrial zone in Viet Nam by 2020.
Meanwhile, the North Gang Province has sought to accelerate the progress of projects, particularly in infrastructure construction projects in industrial parks such as Rich, Guangzhou, Twin Creek-Inner Emperor, to generate land funds.
In 2020, the North Gang Province Trade and Industry Bureau participated in the construction of industrial zones, industrial cluster planning to integrate provincial planning.
North Gang Province has identified the development of industrial parks with a combination of defence security, protection of the ecological environment and food security, thus contributing to balanced industrial development; with comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water supply, transport and telecommunications, combined with urban construction, trade services, workers ' housing and health, education.
In the industrial zone, the North Gang Province has sought for investment projects in high-tech, clean technologies in areas such as electricity, electronics, telecommunications equipment, precision machinery, auxiliary industries.
In the industrial park cluster, the province calls for small and medium-sized investment projects in the production, use of local labour, especially agricultural products, food processing, etc.
In the future, the North Gang Province will focus to accelerate investment in infrastructure at the North Gang City Logistics Logistics Centre and develop in parallel with industrial parks clusters to optimize goods, currency flows and help reduce production costs, improve product value, optimize supply chains and develop multimodal transport, thereby creating attraction for investors investing in the province.
Upgrade Russian helicopter card - first exit at the end of 52M - Xinhua Network
Xinhua Moscow on July 25th, according to the Russian Ministry of Defence, an upgrade of the Russian helicopter (hereinafter known as Wu straight) card-52M will be completed for the first time in December this year, which will be significantly upgraded in reconnaissance, communications and weapons performance.
According to Russian News reports, Wu-52M, the development contract was signed by the Russian military and military engineering units in April, and the first two upgrades were being converted to the Far East helicopter manufacturing plant of the Russian "Progress" Aerospace Group, and its national testing and improvement will end up by October 2022.
According to the Russian expert on the upgrade, the "super short-kidator" - the "older" of the "Face-King" - was officially listed in November 2011, which exposed some weaknesses in use, and the upgrade was intended to "recover the shortboard".
It was reported that Q-52M would partially use new protective materials that do not increase weight, and that the pilot's cabin would be reinforced and equipped with new equipment against missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of survival in the field; more powerful generators to power more complex aircraft on-board electronic equipment; the upgrade of the photovoltaic system to detect and identify more remote field targets; new light multipurpose missiles equipped with major attacks on armoured combat vehicles and steel-band concrete defenses, with a range of 20 kilometres, an increase of the same missile range than the current Russian military force; its defence weapons and communications equipment will maximize the use of m-28NM armed helicopters that can attack air targets, thus making the maintenance simple and economic.
In addition, card-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapons targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also expressed concern that Ka-52M would be equipped with communication equipment to connect to drones in real time, thereby obtaining information from nearby drones in real time in the air, such as showing images of drones on the cabin screen of the helicopter.
As planned, the pilots of the card-52M can directly manipulate drones that work with them, thereby increasing pilot control of the battlefield situation and guide remote missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Minister of Defence, Kryvoruchko, stated last December that the Russian Ministry of Defence plans to purchase more than 110 martial cards-52M by 2027.
The new decree provides that the Albanian region must wear masks from this date on, with a maximum amount of 1,000 euros to a fine of 1,000 euros.

The violation of the provision is a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
The decree also provides that all passengers from non-Shengen countries entering the Kampala region are subject to isolation.
The regional government will authorize health agencies to coordinate specific hotels and isolate positives.
The Act entered into force on 25 July.
In less than an hour, three customers who entered the supermarket were fined.
Hebei's eco-refilling 1750 million cubic metres since this year - New Central Network
Xinhua Shihashi (Reporter Wang Kun) journalist learned from the Hebei Water Hall on July 26 that Hebei Province has been able to use the river and local reservoir water, and has been operating eco-refilling of 28 rivers and white ocean sediments such as the river, Tang River, which has been able to complete the ecological rehydration of the river and lake ecological rehydration of 1.75 million cubic metres.
Hebei Province has seized the enabling time for the North-South Water Midway Project to increase the flow of water and to implement ecological rehydration to rivers such as Tang River, Sand, the Dragon River.
Meanwhile, ecological rehydration has been implemented using nine large and medium reservoirs such as the Western Ocean, East Wushu and the White Ocean to the Yang River, the Blue Dragon River, which cumulatively form a surface area of over 90 square kilometres.
In order to do ecological rehydration, the Hebei Water Department actively organized a refuelling river hazard screening, repairing strengthening and river cleaning, fine-tuning measures and strengthening patrols.
The security of river resupply is ensured by monitoring and centralized under-visiting and centralized visits in a timely manner.
According to the relevant heads of the Hebei Water Office, the orderly implementation of the river and lake eco-refilling has effectively repaired the water environment of the river lake in Hebei Province, which has contributed to the rehabilitation and content of coastal groundwater, which greatly improved the environment and economic development environment along the environment and economic development, and is important for the management of river and lake management objectives for "water purification, shore green, river, well-being".
You should all know the truth I'm going to tell.
I think inequality can cause social divisions and corrupt instincts that existed before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence, and we can understand the effects of inequality by comparing society, with different levels of equality.
I'll show you some data and explain why those data are connected.
But first, let's see how hard our lives are.
I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This figure shows our average life expectancy relative to the gross national income -- which measures the average wealth of the country.
You can see those countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, and they're twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal.
But it doesn't affect the average life expectancy of their nationals.
There's no sign of interrelatedness.
But if we go to understand within society, we can find a lot of health differences within their society.
This map shows still average life expectancy.
These are towns in England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There's a big difference between the poor and others.
Even those who happen to be at the top, their health is worse than those at the top.
So income means very in our society, but the comparison between different societies doesn't make sense.
The contradiction is that in our society, we look at relative income or social status, identity -- the interrelationship between us and the size of the human-person gap.
Once you have that idea, you should think, what happens if the gap expands?
That's what I'm gonna tell you right away.
I didn't use any hypothetical data.
My data comes from the United Nations -- like the World Bank data -- about the income gap between democratic countries in rich, developed markets.
The way we use, simple and easy to understand, and you can download it, compare the top 20% of each country's income gap with the post 20%.
You can see that the countries on the left are more equal -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- and their top 20% wealth is about 20 percent of 3.5 to four times the latter.
But on the other side of the inequality -- Britain, Portugal, the United States, Singapore -- is double the income gap.
In this way, the inequality of our country (United Kingdom) is twice as successful as some of the same successful democratic markets.
I'll show you what this has done to our society.
We collect data on problems that arise from within society, and these problems are more widespread at the bottom of society.
Internationally comparable data include average life expectancy, mathematics and language performance of children, infant mortality, suicide rates, prison population, early pregnancy rates for girls, mutual trust, obesity, mental illness - all of which meet standard diagnostic classifications, including addiction and alcohol addiction - and social mobility rates.
We put all this in a coefficient.
They're all weighted on average.
The score of a country is the average of these factors.
As you can see, these scores are related to the inequality I just showed, and I'll show these data over and over again.
The more unequal the country, the worse the social problems.
It's very relevant.
But if you look at the same health and social problems compared to per capita national income and the index of national income, then you're not gonna find anything, and there's no relevance.
We have a little concern that people might think that we're choosing specific questions to meet our theory and create evidence by people, so we also published a paper on the UNICEF Child Welfare Index.
It contains 40 different parts from someone else's summary.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether there are books in their homes, how much immunity is, and there is any bullying in schools.
Everything's included.
That's the relationship between the index and the same inequality.
In an unequal society, the worse the child's performance.
Relationships and their visibility.
But again, if you look at the relationship between child welfare and per capita national income, you'll have nothing to get... no signs of connection.
All the data I'm showing you are the same.
The average welfare of our society is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They're very important in poor countries, but not for rich developed countries.
And the difference between us and our position to be very important today.
I'll show you some branches of our index.
It's a mutual trust index.
It means the percentage of the number of people who agree to most people.
This is data from the World Values Survey.
As you can see, on the more unequal side, about 15% of the people feel they can believe in others.
But in a more equal society, this percentage has risen to 60% or 65%.
If you look at community activity participation or assessment of social capital, there's a very similar connection that is closely linked to inequality.
I'd say, we repeat this work twice.
The first time we're targeting these rich developed countries, we changed the test, and we repeated the test to 50 states in the United States -- the same question: the more unequal states do it in all these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality from the federal government in a general social survey.
Very similar dispersive distribution in similar levels of trust.
The same thing continues.
Basically, we found that almost all the factors associated with mutual trust reflected in international investigations are also reflected in 50 states we investigate.
It's not a coincidence.
This is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization collects data by random sampling using the same diagnostic interview to enable us to compare the mental illness rate of every society.
This is the ratio of any mental illness in the last year.
It ranges from 8% until 24% -- which shows that the proportion of mental illness in society as a whole is three times the proportion of other societies.
Likewise, these are closely linked to inequality.
This is a crime rate.
Red dots indicate that the states of the United States, the Blue Triangle means the provinces of Canada.
But look at their numbers.
The murder rate is 15 per million until 150.
This is the ratio of prison prisoners.
This is 10 times the gap, and the index function will zoom in this gap.
But the range of people in prison is from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain some of the reasons.
But more harsh trials, or more harsh trials.
The more unequal society is, the more you tend to retain the death penalty.
This is a dropout in high school for children.
Again, there's a big gap.
If we discuss the selection of social talent, the danger of this gap is very serious.
This is a social flow rate.
It's actually based on income flow rates.
Basically, it asks: "Do rich dads have rich children, poor dads have poor children, or there's nothing to do with both of them?"
On the more unequal side, Dad's income is more important -- for example, England, America.
And in Northern Europe, Dad's income is not so important.
There's more social movements.
As we used to say -- I know there are a lot of American listeners here -- if Americans want to realize their American dream, they should go to Denmark.
I've shown here with italics.
I can also show you some other questions.
Those problems are more common at the bottom of the social gradient.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, and these problems seem worse in unequal countries -- not just a little bit bad, but what's two times less than 10 times.
Think about the cost, the cost of manpower.
I want to go back to this map that we've shown before, and we're all combined to explain two points.
First, by a copy of a chart, we find that countries with poor performance, whatever they seem to be more unequal, but those who are doing well seem to be northern and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between universal social disorders and inequality.
Not just one or two things have problems, but almost everything.
Another important point I'd like to point out is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show them very different countries in all ways.
The status of women, their commitment to small families, is in two extremes in rich and developed countries.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has a big difference in income, but it uses taxes, state welfare, generous relief, etc. to close the gap.
Japan is quite different.
First, Japan's pre-tax wage gap is smaller.
It's low tax.
It's less well-being.
And in the U.S. states, we found a clear comparison.
Some states perform well through redistribution, and others perform well because the pre-tax income gap is small.
So we conclude that it is not important to achieve greater equality, and it is important to achieve this equality.
I'm not talking about full equality, but I'm talking about democracy in rich and developed markets.
Another unexpected thing about this is that not just the poor are affected by inequality.
John Dorne seems to be reasonable: "No one is an island. "
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behaviour of every social class in different countries of equality or less.
It's just an example.
This is infant mortality.
According to the British general socio-economic classification, some Swedishs are very kind to classify many infant deaths.
It's a classification based on father-based positions, so single mothers become a set of data.
But we see what we call "the low-level social class," which is a manual job without technology.
The middle is a manual job that requires technology, and then to high-level non-hand work, to professional work -- doctors, lawyers, managers of big companies.
Here's a good job in Sweden than England, doing better in every social class.
The biggest difference is at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We showed five different sets of data, including American and international educational results and health.
It seems generally -- equal societies show the most obvious differences at the bottom of society, but there are also advantages at the upper level of society.
I should explain what's going on.
I think I'm showing and discussing the socio-psychological impact of inequality.
More about the sense of superiority and self-esteem, being valued and despised, respected and demeaned.
Of course, the feelings created by competition in identity have contributed to the progress of social consumerism.
But it also leads to the inadvisibility of status.
What we're more worried about is how people judge and see us, whether we seem attractive, smart, or so on.
Social value evaluation increases fear of these social values.
Interestingly, some similar work in the field of social psychology is also being done: some have looked at 208 different studies; in research, volunteers were invited to a psychological test center and test their stress Holmons and their reactions when they perform stress missions.
In this observation, scientists are interested in which pressure best increases the level of cortex alcohol in the body, the most important pressure Hormon.
And the result is that the tasks that include social evaluation threats -- the task that threatens self-esteem and social status -- are able to judge your performance.
These pressures have very special effects in stress physiology.
We've accepted criticism.
Of course, some people don't like it, and others find it unexpected.
And I should tell you that when people criticize us for picking data, we never did it.
We have an unconditional rule if our data source contains data from the country observed, then we'll include it in the analysis.
Our data sources determine whether the data works, not us.
Otherwise, there's a deviation.
What about the other countries?
In the journal of academic peer review, 200 studies are about the relationship between health and income and equality.
It's not limited to these countries here, and there's a simple proof.
The same country, the same unequal measurement method, the problem one after the other.
Why don't we control other factors?
I've shown you that per capita national income has no impact.
Of course, someone else has applied more complex ways to exclude poverty, education, etc. in experiments.
What about causality?
Relevance does not prove causality in itself.
We spent a lot of time.
Indeed, people have a good understanding of the causal link between our results.
The biggest change in our understanding of the long-term health drivers of rich developed countries is how important the long-term pressure from society on immunity and cardiovascular systems is.
Or, for example, violence in more unequal countries is becoming more common because people are very sensitive to themselves.
I'd say, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of problems after taxes and before taxes.
We should limit income, contain the top-end bonus income culture.
I think we have to do everything we can to take responsibility for our leaders to the staff.
What I want to sum up is that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
In that case, we'll find out that we suddenly solve the social mental health problem of society, which is amazing.
Thank you.

In the last two weeks, Spain's new coronary cases have risen significantly, with thousands of new cases in many days.
The British government decided on Saturday on Saturday (25 July) to remove Spain from the security travel list from the security travel list from Spain for 14 days from Spain.
British tourists who are on vacation in Spain were surprised, worried, even angry, because the news was sudden and caught.
It is reported that the British Secretary of Transport Grant Shapps is also on vacation in Spain.
Norway has announced a 10-day isolation before the British release of quarantine measures.
France and Belgium recommend that residents abandon the plans for vacations in Barcelona and surrounding areas.
The beach overcrowding in these areas is unable to keep social distance between people, and the police need to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is a major pillar of Spain.
Spain: This is safe.
In response to the British decision, the Spanish Foreign Ministry stated on Sunday that the country's epidemic was controlled.
The Spanish Foreign Minister, Arancha Gonzalez Laya, stressed to the media: "Spain is safe not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists. "
The Spanish Government will try to convince the British government to exclude the Balilic Islands and Canary Islands from isolation measures.
The reason is that these two tourist resorts have a much less infection rate than the British mainland.
To prevent the spread of the epidemic, Catalonia, Spain has also been restarted.
Tourism is a major pillar of Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular resorts for British tourists.
This decision in England is expected to affect Spain's tourism.

The first day of the Middle Fall: Beijing is not hot and hot, and the rain mode is open - Xinhua Network
Xinhua, Beijing, July 26th, July 26th, is the first day of this year's Mid-Standing.
The storm in the morning of 26th, which spreads the hot and hot summers in Beijing, and the new rainfall will last for days.
The Beijing Weather Station was released at 1100 hours on 26 hours, with a decentralized rain (with weak lightning), with a maximum daily temperature of 27 degrees C; small to medium rain at night (with weak lightning) and the minimum temperature at night was 23  degrees C.
And in the previous 24-25 days, Beijing was in the high temperature blue warning, with the highest daily temperature in large parts of the country at about 37 degrees C, with a high temperature of over 40 degrees C.
The sky is the highest temperature in a year, wet, hot days, "three volts" a year, the hottest in the middle, and the Chinese people say "suffering summer."
When you were in the ambush, the house filled the barn, and the folk had the word "one-volt dumplings."
According to the current forecast, the weather in Beijing will be in the next three days.
The weather department has advised the public to minimize mountain play and prevent geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's "middle ambush" has 20 days, starting on July 26th, until August 14.
When you get into the middle, people feel weak and appetites.
The choice of green beans, twilight, etc. with hot summer, spleen appetizers, and bitter foods such as bitter vegetables, bitter melons, can help to improve appetite and remove the heat.
The engine could be out of fire.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) issued an emergency flight clearance order requires an emergency inspection of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, depending on the corrosive air valve of the above-mentioned passenger aircraft, which could cause engine air parking.
The Federal Aviation Agency stated that four reports of air parking of 737 NG and 737Classic aircraft engines have been received so far, resulting in emergency inspection requirements for less than 11 passenger aircraft to date after the suspension of passenger aircraft for seven days or more.
The Federal Aviation Agency warned that, if all two engines, the fifth stop valve of the passenger aircraft, could be stuck in the open position, causing the passenger plane to be completely out of power and unable to restart the engine.
This aviation regulatory authority ordered that once the stop valve is corrupted, the air operator must replace this key component before the passenger aircraft is re-entered.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new coronary outbreak led to reduced travel demand, and many passenger aircraft were sealed or less used, and " stop valves are more corrosive " .
Boeing also said that the air operator had been recommended to check the passenger aircraft involved in the Directive, and if problems were found, Boeing would provide help in the overhaul and replacement of the stop valve.
Associated Press reports that passenger aircraft under the flag of the United States usually fly several times a day, but a large number of passenger aircraft stopped after the new coronary outbreak; as passenger demand grew slowly, some passenger aircraft were re-entered.
The Federal Aviation Agency did not issue details of four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines revealed one of the events later on 24th.
In its statement, the airline operator said that a passenger plane under the flag flew from Seattle to Austin, Texas, on July 15, a engine suddenly shut down, and that the passenger plane eventually landed at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines says the engine of the passenger plane has been replaced and six passenger engines have been checked according to the Federal Aviation Agency's instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines 24th, respectively, said that there was no engine out of the air stop valve under the flag.
Four passenger aircraft under the flag of American Airlines will be examined and 28 passenger aircraft under the banner of the United Airlines will be examined.
Dammy Airlines said he'd check 20 passenger planes under the flag, but it didn't indicate whether the engine went out.
Many media reports that the Federal Aviation Agency Emergency Air Navigation Directive is another impact on Boeing.
One Boeing 737MAX passenger aircraft each of Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, resulting in a total of 346 deaths.
This series of passenger aircraft then stopped globally, which was shut down in January this year and resumed production in May.
Steve Dixon, Director of the Federal Aviation Agency, admitted in June that the Federal Aviation Agency had made a mistake in the supervision of Boeing on the 737 MAX passenger plane.
"Dinging on the line! Teacher's on the line next week."
There's a new art online.
Interactive knowledge sharing show "Ding on the line! Good teacher" will be broadcast on Hunan Watch from July 20th.
It is understood that the program will create a new-age youth class, and a group of talented teachers will rise and challenge fun knowledge output.
Unlike the serious impression of the former teacher group in the public, "Ding on the line! Teacher's good" brings together a group of knowledge representatives of the face and talent.
They're both young people from all disciplines, or a group of full-time "hands" who are good at teaching music.
In the show, the example of the good youth knowledge, as a knowledge-sharing officer, will challenge the fun knowledge class.
They need to move the audience in the field through attitude to show the most interesting side of the subject.
And the "There is a question of change" on the scene of the "knowledge-sharing officer" that makes it difficult to teach the knowledge-sharing officer and add a little exciting atmosphere to the program.
It is revealed that the "knowledge sharing officer" included in the Chinese People's University, Li Yong Lok, a leading teacher, Zhang Xue Feng, and a former teacher with 10 years of experience, will show the knowledge of the "hard core" of all disciplines in an unexpected way.
In addition, the program invited Professor Xue Mifeng as the "knowledge sponsor" of the show, to join the "Dinking Help" Du Haitao and Dreamja, to talk to the audience about youth and build "Public Youth for All".
Director, Department of Government of the HKSAR: The situation is serious and fully resistant to the epidemic - China New Network
Xinhua Hong Kong, 26 July, Director of the Department of Government of the Government of Hong Kong, Zhang Jianzong, stated that the situation of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continued to be severe, and that if the epidemic breaks, the Special District Government will take more severe control measures to further limit the business of the premises and reduce the space outside of the public.
But at this stage, the Special District government didn't mean to launch a "home order" or a "prohibited order" to limit the departure of citizens.
Zhang Jianzong published the Internet on the day entitled "The situation is hard to fight the disease."
He said that the epidemic was the worst in half a year and will be crucial in the next two weeks, trying to prevent the further spread of the virus in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the District Government, it is also important for citizens to discipline and cooperation.
He called on citizens to stay home as much as possible, reduce social contact and out-of-home meals.
Citizens should cooperate with the mandatory measures to wear masks to protect themselves and others, and focus on personal and environmental hygiene and handwashing, and should suspend non-necessity meetings or dinners and reduced to street markets.

He was very concerned about the infection in the old house, and the Special District Government had arranged specific temporary quarantine centres for their homemates.
He said that the Special District Government was building quarantine facilities near the quarantine centre of the Bay of Takeshi Bay in the New Territories, which is expected to provide 700 additional quarantine rooms by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on 19th that the Special District Government would build 2,000 quarantine rooms in the quarantine centre in Takeshi Bay and seek to be inaugurated by the end of this year.
Plus 800 quarantine centres have been operational, and the quarantine centre is expected to provide a total of 3,500 quarantine rooms before the end of the year.
There are currently four active quarantine quarantine centres in Hong Kong, providing approximately 2,600 quarantine rooms.
In addition, the District Government re-launched the Carp Gate Park resort on Hong Kong Island as a community isolation facility for patients under 50 years of age with independent self-care.
The history of the party, the nutrition agent of the New China history.

Recently, Secretary-General Xi, in his visit to the Four-Ping Memorial Museum, stressed: " To give 1.4 billion people, more than 90 million party members, especially at all levels, to learn the history of the Communist Party of China, and the history of the new China. "
Learning the history of the party, the history of the New China, is a necessary lesson for party cadres, remembers the mission, and learn from it, to learn from it, to take the long journey of a new era.
A vast history of the party, the history of New China, records the hard struggle and light journey of the Communist Party since its birth, showing the faith and loyalty of the Communists who have always held with life and blood.
History is the best textbook, and for party cadres, the history of the New China is the most beautiful chapter in this textbook.
Each party cadre must continue to strengthen the historical thinking of history, to move towards the future, to a new mission, to take the times' relay stick and take the long march of modern people.
In history, in the history of the party, in the history of the New China, the first mission of the new Chinese history.
The history of the party, the history of New China, is full of the eternal first mission of the Chinese Communists and the strong faith of the rock, showing the simpleness of the Communists who will always be with the people.
To learn about party history, important events in the history of New China, important meetings, important people, not only visual mind shock, but also to read the meaning of the first faith in the soul, and the weight of the mission.
For party cadres, to continue to be a first-time mission, to find our original point of departure from the history of the party, the beginning of our first heart, to keep a clear understanding and firm position, and to provoke the power of the nation to fight for the people, to ensure that revolution ancestors are passed on with blood and life.
It's wise to learn the history of the party, to pass the noble spirit in the history of the new China.
Since the establishment of the Communist Party of China, the spirit of the Red Ship, the spirit of Ikayama, the spirit of the long march, the spirit of the Yangan, the spirit of war, the spirit of war, the spirit of Sibalpo, the spirit of the "two-shot one star" spirit, the space spirit, etc.
The great spirit of these history, which provides a strong spiritual inspiration for our party to overcome risk challenges on the way forward, the precious spiritual wealth that cannot be broken, undispersed.
Learning the history of the party, the process of Chinese history is a process of shaping these spirits and self-sonance, and to be conscious of the noble spirit of the revolutionary ancestors, to keep the communists' spiritual home, to advance the great cause, to build a solid spiritual foundation for the great cause, and to inherit and promote them and to shine their new times.
Read the history of the party, and in the history of the New China, the history of the new China.

According to the management of Cocosili, the Sanjiang National Park Authority, the number of re-locations of antelopes has generally risen year by year, with 4860 in 2019 and 338 more than in 2018.
Even Shining said, "It is expected to end in early September this year, and the number of re-entry of the antelope remains expected to increase."
The Tibetan antelope is protected by animals at the national level.
At the end of May of each year, from the three rivers of Qinghai, Tibet Tong, Xinjiang Alkin Mountain, etc., are headed for the lambs of Lake Drone, located in the heart of Coco.
Wu Xiaomin, a researcher at the Animal Institute of the Province of Shaanxi Province, said: "The return of the Tibetan antelope is the process of returning to their habitat with young children after the end of the female antelope. The return group that left the place of birth was relatively large at first, but then the Tibetans will return to their own habitat according to different geographical populations. "
To ensure a safe return of the Tibetan flock, journalists learned that the former Sanjiang Source National Park Authority, Cocosili Management Office, Yangtzegen Park, has arranged for staff to continue video monitoring and patrols in the main area of relocation.
If there are found that the Tibetans try to cross the road, the cruisers will conduct temporary traffic controls at the first time, allowing the flock to safely pass the wildlife passage and ensure that it is less disturbed by humans on the way back.
So, how do we get out of the summer in everyday life?
Experts suggest that summer out to avoid the heat as much as possible, it is best not to walk or work in the sun before noon, because the sun is the strongest and the possibility of heat.
If you have to go out at this time, you must do protective work, like an umbrella, a suncap, a sunglasses, and the best to put sunscreen on the condition to protect sunscreen.
The clothes try to use light, air-resistant cotton, numb, silk, less fibre-optic clothing, so that they can't heat in time when sweating is not allowed to heat in time.
When you're hot and hot, you have to prepare enough water, drink in time, not wait for thirst, because once you feel thirsty means that the body is out of water, it's controlled at 150 ml to 200 ml, drink warm water, and don't drink ice water.
According to the low temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, high temperature operators, 3 to 5 litres of water per day.
When sweats more, you can add some salt water to make up for the salt that the body loses because of sweat.
Besides, the summer body is vulnerable to potassium, and it's exhausting, and potassium tea is a great summer drink.
The water content of 80 to 90%, such as raw vegetables, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. in summer, can be used to supplement moisture; dairy products can be filled with both water and the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, the population working in a high temperature environment should be properly supplemented by drinks containing potassium, magnesium, etc.
Summers are short, high temperatures, metabolisms, consumption and fatigue.
Adequate sleep allows the brain and body systems to relax, both work and learning and measures to prevent heat.
Experts say the best bedtime is between 22 and 2300 hours, and the best wake-up time is 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.
Be careful not to lie under air conditioning vents and fans to avoid air conditioning and heat.
Experts suggest that people who operate outdoors or high temperature operations can carry 10 drops of water, man Dan, fragrance or fragrance, or in the near workplace, in case of summer.
I hope you can spend some time thinking about a very simple fact that, so far, most of our knowledge of the universe comes from light.
We stand on Earth looking at the night sky and see the stars in the sky with our naked eyes.
The sun is so bright,
We can see the light back from the moon.
Since Galileo targeted his simplistic astronomical telescope at the object of the universe, and to this day, the universe we know, by light.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we have been able to collect a silent universe image -- this series of images dating back to a big explosion.
But the universe is not a silent, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own mix, and the universe itself is playing, because space can be as vibrating as drums.
So when something big happens, it can make a series of voices to the universe.
Now, we want to be able to give this grand visual work on the universe with a sound.
We've never heard voices from outer space, but we should be able to turn the volume up in the next few years and hear what's going on there.
In response to capture the sound of the universe, we focus on black holes and the prospects it shows, because black holes can hit time and time, and make a very special sound like a drum hammer hit the drum, and I'm very happy to show you some of the voices we predict.
One day we may see a shadow, a black hole that can leave a shadow in a very bright background, but it's not yet observed.
Although black holes are not seen, they could be heard, because they hit time like drums.
The idea that the universe can make the same sound comes from Albert Einstein, and many of our ideas come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this picture, except for the auxiliary lines on it.
But if we fall freely in the universe, even without these auxiliary lines, our trajectory will draw these lines, because we'll find that we're moving along the straight line, along the lines that don't bend through the universe.
Einstein also realized that -- this is the real most critical part -- if you put energy and matter in the universe, the universe bends. The object of the free fall will be biased through objects like the sun.
That's Einstein's great broad relativity.
Even the path of light is bended.
When it turns to a certain extent, it turns around the orbit of the sun, like the Earth is around the sun, the moon is around the Earth.
It's a natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you compressed the sun into a ball six kilometers in diameter -- that means you compressing the mass of the Earth into a ball of six kilometers in diameter, and you'll make a black hole, which is very dense that if the light is too close to it, it will not escape -- leave a huge black shadow in the universe.
But Einstein always thought black holes were just a math wonder.
He doesn't believe there's a black hole.
He believes nature will stop the formation of black holes to protect us.
After decades, people started using the term "black hole" and realized that black holes were real objects -- in fact, they were a state of death after a catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun will not collapse into black holes.
It's not really good enough.
But if we do some thought experiments -- Einstein would love to do it -- we could pretend to crush the sun and within six kilometers, and then put a little planet around its orbit, like on orbit 30 km from the black hole sun.
The Earth glows itself, because now the sun is gone, we don't have any other light -- so our little planet has to shine ourselves.
You'll find that you can even put the Earth on orbit 30 km from the black hole and make it happy to run around orbit.
This black hole is actually almost as big as Manhattan.
Before it destroys the Earth, it could expand to Hudson Street.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that was compressed to half of Manhattan.
So we move this Earth near the black hole -- 30 kilometers -- and we noticed it runs around the black hole along the perfect orbit.
There are rumors that black holes will devour everything in the universe, but actually you have to be very close to falling in.
But impressively, from our point of view, we always see the Earth.
It can't hide behind the black hole.
The light from the Earth, part of the black hole, but there's a part of it that we saw after the black hole bends.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the play of the space fortress Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun will not collapse into a black hole; it's not of great quality, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them is eating the galaxy, it'll look like this.
We'll see a shadow of a black hole in hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy and the dust belts of stars.
If we fall into this black hole, we'll see the light being refraction around the black hole, and we don't even feel some huge changes that happen when we start entering this shadow.
If we try to start the rocket and get out of there, it won't be good, because we can't escape, even light can't escape.
Although the black hole looks dark from outside, it's not in there, because the light of all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, due to the time expansion of relativity, our clocks seem slower than the time of the galaxy, which looks like the outside galaxies are accelerating, just before we're destroyed by black holes ourselves.
It's like experiencing the feeling of dying, and you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a complete death experience.
You can't tell anyone you saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we've never seen a shadow left behind such a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they can't be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomy -- imagine two black holes that have been together for a long time.
Maybe they were stars and then collapsed into two black holes -- each mass was 10 times the sun.
Now we compress them within 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times a second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at light speed.
In a few seconds, they can travel thousands of miles, and in the process, they not only bend space, but also create a vibration of space in the tails behind them, a real time wave.
Black holes make space squeeze and stretch when it hits with the universe.
These vibrations spread in space at light speed.
This computer simulation was done by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency's relativity group.
It took almost 30 years to solve this problem.
This is one of the many teams.
It shows two black holes spinning around each other, and these are the imaginary curves.
As you can see -- it may be a little blurry -- you can see that the red waves are fired, and these are gravity waves.
They are the voices of the real universe, and these voices will spread from these black holes at light speed to the light speed, until these two black holes are integrated into a quietly spinning black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the squeeze and stretching of these spaces.
You can really hear these voices.
Of course, you'll find your head being squeezed and stretching, so you may not understand what happened.
But I'd like to play our predictions for you.
This is my team's research - a relatively brief computing model.
Imagine a smaller black hole falling into a larger black hole.
The sound you heard came from a small mass black hole that crashed with space in the process of near the big mass black hole.
If they're far away, they'll be very small.
But the sound becomes like a drum hammer knocks on space, and it's vibrating like a drum.
We can predict what this sound will become.
We know that in the process of falling, small mass black holes will get faster and louder.
Eventually, we'll hear the little black hole completely fall into the big black hole.
I never thought it was that loud - here it was actually magnified.
When you listen at home, I think it's a little bit of a bad voice.
Sounds like, Tink, Ding, Ding.
This is another sound of our research team simulation.
I'm not here to show you images, because black holes don't leave any useful traces, and real space will not show you those virtual curves.
But if you hear that sound on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run.
Better get away from that voice.
Both black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they're all shaking.
Then they'll be one.
That sharp sound is the symbol of the integration of black holes - the sound of a sharp sound when the integration is over.
This is what we're gonna see about what we're gonna see.
Fortunately, we're very safe on Long Beach in California.
There is no doubt that two black holes in the universe have been integrated.
And there is no doubt that the space around us can feel these vibrations that travel through a million light years, or a million years ago, spread at light speed and eventually meet us.
But these voices are too small that we can't hear.
Some of the world's experiments require a lot of heart to build -- one of which is an experiment called LIGO -- which will detect space vibrations that are less than a atomic nuclear range every four kilometers away.
It's a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be exceeded in the coming years -- it will be used to detect space vibration.
Another research project on the universe is expected to be launched in the next 10 years, called LISA.
LISA will see super-mass black holes -- those black holes that are millions or billions of times the mass of the sun.
From the images that were returned from the Hubble telescope, we saw these two galaxies.
Looks like they're still hugging.
Their center may have a huge super black hole.
But they're not static, they're actually integrating.
These two black holes will crash, and their integration will go through billions of years.
So collecting their voices is beyond the limits of our human perception.
But LISA can see the final phase of the two super-mass black holes that started to integrate a long time ago, 15 minutes before they were integrated.
This detection is not limited to black holes, but it can also be used to detect any major disturbance in the universe - the biggest disturbance of the universe is "the Big Bang".
When the word was created, some people mocked -- "Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This animation short film I made by a friend of Proton Studios shows the scene of watching the Big Bang from the outside.
We would never want to do this; we want to be inside the universe, because there's no such situation outside the universe.
So imagine you're in the big explosion.
The universe is everywhere, everything is around you, and space is swinging in orderly.
14 billion years have passed, and the sound is still around us.
Galactics are forming, a group of stars formed in galaxies, at least one planet like this on a planet that is suitable for living.
Here we go crazyly build experiments, calculate, write computer codes.
Imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes crashed.
This sound has been traveling through the air all along.
We didn't even show up here.
It's getting closer - 40,000 years ago, we drew on the stone wall of the cave.
If the sound we're going to get is the Big Bang of the universe, it sounds like this.
Technically, it's noise.
It's a white noise, a messy bell.
But it's everywhere around us, as long as it's not offset by some other processes in the universe.
If we can detect these voices, it'll be like music in our ears, because the quiet echo comes from the moment we're created, from the universe we look up.
So in the next few years, we'll be able to make the volume of these music a little bit more, and let the universe present it to us in audio form.
But if we can detect those first moments, it will make us go further from understanding the Big Bang, so that we can ask some of the most difficult, and the most floating questions.
If we play the universe backwards, we can know that there was a big explosion in the past, and we could even hear it that loud voice, but our big explosion was the only big explosion in the universe?
I mean, we're gonna ask if there was a big explosion like that before that?
Will it happen again?
I'd like to say if we raise the meaning of this question to the level that TED advocates, at least in the last minute, we can ask questions that we may never answer.
But we can't help but ask, "Will our universe be just an episode of a bigger history?"
Or would we be just a branch of the multi-dimensional universe -- each branch has experienced its own big explosion -- maybe some of them have buzzed black holes, perhaps some of them -- maybe some of them have conscious lives, perhaps some that don't exist -- they don't belong to our past, nor in our future, but in some way?
So we can't help but guess that if there is a multi-space, in other branches of this diverse universe, is there life?
This is our life in the universe.
Is there any other life in the multi-dimensional universe, and are they guessing our existence, thinking about their own origins?
If that's the case, I can imagine them, doing calculations, writing computer codes, building experimental instruments, trying to detect the weak voices that come from their origins, and suspect who else is there.
Thank you.

Graduate art exhibition moved into the mall public service exhibition - Xinhua Network
In the seasons of "The Cloud Graduate" in all colleges, a rare sub-lined graduate art show began on the weekend.
But it is neither in the gallery nor on campus, but in the public space of the city of Dynasty and is open to the public free of charge, until August 23rd.
Journalists learned that the 2020 graduate art exhibition collected 50 works/groups of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Chinese Media University and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, which extends from 2 to 6 floors, and to make full use of the interior light box for graphic displays, to maximize the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
The significance of this exhibition is particularly special in the epidemic.
The head of Mei Chen, the head of the city of Chaoyang, Guping, said, "We chose to bring back to the "Wind" graduation exhibition, and wanted more people to see young people's exploration and understanding of the world, magnifying the healing power of art for society and the mind. "
She revealed that the work of the exhibition was collected to graduates of several art colleges, and that it was selected from which it was suitable for commercial space, in the form of painting, sculpture, to new media devices, interactive animations, VR panoramas, mass and abundance were the highest in the past year.
Among them, Lee Yunshaw expressed his feelings in the first battle of 2020 through mechanical and manual creative language; Liu Ka-young explored the themes of "encrypted currency", "credit creation", "trade" in Zhang Jia-chul, through the first battle; Zhang Jia-chul's "Catlin" and Qiuda's "Standing" are often associated with humans, and young artists can see the understanding of human relations between people and animals; and the work of Chu's "The Winter of Faith" is a reminder of young people growing up, "When the cause is done, remember that one day, remember the pure and sincere. "
Among the few of the graduates who have been personally displayed, Li Zhongxi, from the sculpture department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when it was a little worried about the epidemic and had a nucleic acid test three days in advance, with alcohol cotton and testing reports. "
His work, yesterday's mystery, is complicated and must be friendly.
And he's also on the mission to help his classmates fix the damage.
"It's a little sad to show up until 4:30 a.m., and then it's a little bit of a patch. "
He wants to come to Beijing when the epidemic is more stable and come to Beijing with his classmates.

That morning, he was 65-year-old Bosonaro tweets on Twitter, and he was wearing sneakers, without masks, sitting in front of a table with breakfast, smiled, one thumb on one hand, and the other hand raised a box of oxychlorine medicine.
He wrote in the tweet, "Good morning! The results of the new coronary virus test: negative."
But Bosonaro did not explain when the new coronary virus was tested.
On July 5, Bosonaro had new coronary pneumonia symptoms, and the results of the virus were positive on six days, and on 7th he was diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia.
On 14 and 21st, Bosonaro conducted a new coronary virus test twice, and the results were still positive.
During the quarantine period, Bosonaro displayed its hydroxychlorine drugs on several occasions live through social media and said that the hydrochlorine was very effective for the new coronary pneumonia treatment and was well taken, and that it was in a good state of HYC, claiming that Brazilian medical institutions used chloroquinol drugs to treat new coronary pneumonia.
According to Brazilian media reports, five cabinet ministers and 10 governors in Brazil have been diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia.
A small plane crash in the Swiss Alps, all four people were killed - China New Net.
On July 26, the Central New Network, according to the European Union News Agency, reported that on July 25, local time, the Swiss police informed the media that a small aircraft crashed in the Swiss Alps.
All two Swiss and two Austrians were killed in the accident.
It was reported that the Wallis police in southern Switzerland stated that a small aircraft crashed over 3,000 metres above sea level near the Alps peak in Vale, and that rescue personnel had arrived at the crash site, and that all four people were killed after the crash site.
The Valé police said that witnesses called the police at 1225 p.m. on 25 noon and said he had witnessed a small plane falling from the sky.
In a few minutes, witnesses told the police that the crash site had a rolling smoke.
After the police were called, quickly coordinated fire officers, medical personnel and rescue personnel and carrying helicopters to rescue the accident site.
After the rescue personnel arrived at the crash site, all four people on the plane were killed.
Police have been verified that the victims of the accident included two Swiss aged 50 and 66, as well as two Austrians aged 46 and 50.
Police say that the police are currently working with the Swiss Transport Security Investigation Commission to investigate the causes of the crash.
There were heavy rains in 33 districts in Chongqing.
Reporter from the Chongqing City Water Bureau of the City of Chongqing on July 26th was informed of a storm in 33 districts in Chongqing over the past 24 hours, 16 of which had heavy rains in 16 districts.
The storm caused 71 small and medium-sized rivers in Chongqing, and two flood alerts have been released in the area.
According to the Chongqing City Hydrological Monitoring Station, most of the areas of Chongqing occurred in heavy rains and heavy rains.
There were heavy rains in 33 districts such as Zhongnan, Copper Liang, Hogawa, of which were rained in 16 districts, such as the county, Kaizhou, Witch Creek; the largest daily rainfall appeared in the village of Yongshan, Kimshan Town, Namchuan, 197.5 mm.
71 small and medium-sized rivers, such as the South River, the South River of Kaizhou, 1 to 7 metres of water rise, with the highest level of water not over-security.
It is expected that small and medium-sized rivers in the Chongqing region are expected to have different levels of water increases, and individual small and medium rivers may have over-police water floods.
The locals will also focus on the possible transit floods in the Yangtze River.

The Chinese New Net client, July 26, according to official CBA league, the CBA Qingdao district finally welcomed the first fans of the competition after the re-enactment.
The live watch fans include people who move the Qingdao mobile staff and doctors, teachers, public security personnel, etc., who have made outstanding contributions to society during the epidemic, and on July 31st, the CBA post-season race will be officially resumed for the fans.
The CBA league began the re-enactment on June 20, after almost five months of interruption.
Although there were few viewers in the afternoon of 26th, the camp was clear: someone was applauding, and someone was silent.
The players are fighting the court, and the fans are fighting the court for a long time.
In the post-season game, if the fans want to watch the game, they'll be careful.
The opening of the fans' ticketing game is the Diamond Stadium of the Qingdao National Sports Centre (Shangshan) and the sale of tickets is fully online, and the system of real-named entrances under the line, and all watch fans must be 12 years old and hold 48 hours of certification for kernel acid testing.
The prize is $50,000.
On July 26, the Hubei Daily News (Reporter Lin Jing), the city of Enshi informed the geological disaster point monitor that had made an important contribution to the sand dam slide warning and sent him a $50,000 bonus.
At the same time, call on the whole city members to learn his duty, to do his duty, to act, to be willing to give.
On July 21, the sand dam in the village of the Ma's village of Nsch City, led to the formation of Lake Xie, 58-year-old Chen Liang was the first person to early warning the slope.
On the afternoon of July 17th, Chen Xing learned about the broken walls of the villagers and immediately went to the scene.
He just walked out of his home, and he saw the village road cracked four or five centimeters, extending along the road to cornfield, about 50 meters long.
Chen Lightton was alert to send pictures of the road to the country's "geological disaster monitor" in the first time.
The slopes are highly likely to be taken and judged by the relevant heads of the Natural Planning Institute in Tuenburg Village, and then the decision to evacuate the crowd.
Chen's timely warning won 36 hours of valuable time for the safe evacuation of 315 families of 1339 people in the area.
This major geological disaster, none of them were casualties.
Chen Liang's spirit of professionalism is praised by the public.
In the face of praise, he said, "No one saved, it's my responsibility."
The University of Australia is developing new drugs that are expected to be used to treat the new crown-induced veins.
Researchers at the University of Monash, Australia, on July 26, are developing a new drug that helps prevent heart disease and strokes and hope that it can be used to treat blood vessels triggered by the new coronary virus.
Researchers found that before heart disease or strokes, an enzyme in the plate would accelerate the condensation of the plate.
So they're developing a drug that temporarily inhibits the plate condensation, thereby avoiding blood vessels and preventing heart disease and strokes.
Researchers say that this drug only inhibits the condensation effect of the plate when there is a heart attack or stroke signs.
Because studies have shown that similar blood vessels are one of the main causes of the death of new coronary diseases, researchers hope that this drug can be used for treatment for such serious patients in the future.
Currently, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers prepare for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The results of the study were published in the American magazine Science Conversion Medicine.
He became the first audience to enter after the CBA re-enactment allows the audience to watch the game.
That day, in the second phase of the Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) in the 2019-2020 season of Shandong Qingdao, where medical personnel, teachers, public security fronters entered the Shanghai Long-term Army to the East and West Kings competition through the official purchase platform.
During the game, the viewers had to wear masks, pairs, and kept a seat at a metre apart.
When you leave the field, the audience must leave in order in the middle of the two sides, and keep the "one-metre line" social distance back in order.
Xinjiang Deep Farming Sunflower Fields with clean energy - China New Net
2020-07-26 15:43:42 Source: China News Network by Chen Hai Feng Responsible Editor: Chen Hai Feng
The Chinese New York Society, Xinjiang, July 26th, was called "The Sunflower Field" in Xinjiang, with clean energy.
More than 600 five-sided sunglasses, 48 square metres each, one circle, like a silver "Sunflower Field", turns with the sun, reflecting sunlight to a 200-metre-high suction tower in the centre, and power generation.
The journalist saw this scene at the Hammy salt tower light thermal power plant in Iuhu Lake, Iuhu County, Xinjiang.
"The so-called melting salt tower photothermal power generation is to reflect solar light into thermal energy through mirror concentration to the suction tower, and then transform heat energy into electricity through traditional power generation technologies ... "
Zhang Yong, Deputy Managing Director of China Electric Hami Solar Thermal Power Company, introduced that it was designed to be similar to the solar stoves used in rural villages in the north-west China.
The power plant was built in October 2017 and was connected by the end of the year, covering 6,600 acres of land, and a total of 14,500 daily mirrors were planned.
"The greatest advantage of traditional solar power generation technologies is that it can store the concentration of heat and generate electricity at night ... "
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project could keep the generator team operating continuously and not affected by light change; it could also be rapidly involved in grid-based peaking according to the demand of the grid.
After the project was fully completed, the annual power generation could be achieved at $198 million per year, saving more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxide, approximately 20 tons of smoke dust, over 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, providing continuous clean energy sources for the local source.
Besides, there's another silver "Sunflower Field" in the Stone City Optical Park in Hami City.
The Hamiff Light Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers more than 2,300 acres, with 714 power plants built to follow the sun and keep the sun and the spotlight to 90 degrees straight.
"We use a two-axis tracking polyphoto-power generation technology to maintain power efficiency by unified integrated controls, and all power generation equipment will maintain power efficiency according to the solar height ... "
Monkki, the chief of the station, said that in light weather conditions, the power generation technology could increase the efficiency of more traditional photovoltaics by about 20 per cent.
In the first half of this year, the power plant has achieved more than 7 million degrees of power generation, which complements local electricity demand.
The Stone City Photovoltaic Industrial Park is the largest single body in Xinjiang, with the most complete photovoltaic component model park, with 38 in the photovoltaic power project, with a total of 820,000 kilowatts.
Over 110 million degrees of electricity was completed in the first half of this year, an increase of 6 per cent over the same period in 2019.
Hamy is one of the best solar resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation volume is over 6,200 megafocal per square metre, with about 3,200 hours per year.
In recent years, the city has developed the photovoltaic industry and has grown the Sunflower field.
The solar power generation of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built, with more than 1.4 billion degrees of photovoltaic power in the first half of this year, an increase of about 14 per cent over the same year.
Currently, more than 330 grid photovoltaic stations, with a capacity of over 10 million kilowatts.
It is expected that photovoltaic power generation will be 15 billion degrees throughout the year, replacing more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police have informed the details of the "girl college students to travel to Qinghai" and the search and rescue work continues.
On July 26, Xining, Xining, recently, "A female college student went to Qing Hagelwood" to lose attention.
The Public Security Bureau of the City of Galmu, Hexi Mongolian Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, informed on 26 days that Huang, a student at a university in Nanjing, is still in a state of disconnection and is actively working on a search for work.
On 10 July 2020, the Security Directorate of the City of Germu, Hexi State, was informed that Huang, a university student in Nanjing, was shut down and lost on July 5, by Nanjing to Galmu, on 9 July, in the south-west area of the Sonandaj Protection Station, Yukashi Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, requesting assistance to find out.
According to the investigation by the Galmu City Public Security Bureau, Huang entered Qinghai at 190054 hours on 6 July and arrived in Galmu City on 7 hours.

The American media have revealed the truth about China's Consulate General's Office in Houston.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Zhongxiang Author: Zhu Ying Jing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yan Jing
The American media have revealed the truth about China's Consulate General in Houston.
On 24th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the United States Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and made specific requests for the termination of all operations and activities by the Consulate General as a counter-measure to suddenly request China to close the Consulate General in Houston on 21st.
The U.S. government has raised multiple concerns and its political motivations have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why ask China to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media claim that it is not clear why the United States will choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the media has been saying: for the general election.
On 23rd, CNN reported that the United States had asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston to raise questions about their political motivations.
The article states that the catastrophic response of the United States government to the new coronary epidemic has led to a low rate of polls before the election.
White House officials personally claim that the tough strategy for China was to save Trump's support rate and to transfer the White House outbreak to respond to failure.
The article states that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven, very careful" goal in the United States, and that the U.S. government chose it as "to create tough attitudes while avoiding the risk of causing major conflicts".
BBC also believes that when the US economy is hit by the outbreak, when the US economy is hit by a serious outbreak, Trump thinks "playing Chinese cards" has a political advantage.
The current situation is "a spiral-up, sharp struggle," which is partly driven by the U.S. government from the perspective of domestic considerations, which only exacerbates tensions between China and the United States.
CBS reports that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure on the outbreak, and he has repeatedly accused China for the outbreak.
America has almost every day new actions against what Trump calls "China's exploitation of America".
"The Houston Consulate is important to establish a two-State connection."
The Associated Press commented that the United States asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston to exacerbate tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic implications, Chinese citizens in southern the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services and the same difficulties in finding visas and other services.
A business group in Houston regrets that the United States has asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston, claiming that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural linkages between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
The American Foreign Policy magazine website believes that this American move is part of a series of provocative initiatives that will only exacerbate relations in the United States."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Polak, an East Asian expert at the United States think tank Brookings Society, saying that since the establishment of a comprehensive diplomatic relationship between the United States and the two countries in 1979, he has not thought of any action that could be compared to the United States's operations against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong South China Morning reports that this move is unprecedented in foreign relations between China and the United States for over 40 years.
Analysts believe that this move could cause persistent damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was built in 1979 as the first General Consulate in China in the United States.
Currently, China has an embassy and five Consulate Generals in the United States.

The speaker stressed that the Chinese government was a strong defender of cybersecurity, always strongly opposed and combating any form of cyberattacks and cybercrime.
According to the media, hacker organizations related to China have interfered with a British corporate network system, attacking British-American technology companies with patented data and invaded the EU national government network.
The speaker said that the Chinese government was a strong defender of cybersecurity, always strongly opposed and combating any form of cyberattacks and cybercrime.
The virtuality of cyberspace, the difficulty of traceability, the diversity of actors, should be sufficient evidence in the investigation and qualitative network events, and cannot be guessed.
The spokesman said that a series of events like the Prism Gate proved that the United States had been conducting the largest cyber-stealing operation in the world.
Peace and stability in cyberspace are in the common interest of all countries.
The speaker said that China ' s achievements in science and technology innovation were not stolen, not stolen, but through self-reliance and hard work.

The Urumqi free nucleic acid testing most areas have been largely completed for secondary testing in high-risk areas - new network
On July 26, Urumqi, the Director of the Urumqi City Health Committee of Urumqi, Urumqi City, stated that most of the free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi City had now been largely completed.
The State Council Group and Autonomous Region, Urumqi City experts are further assessing the development of the epidemic based on the results of the nucleic acid detection and epidemiology survey.
The News Office of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th of the Xinjiang outbreak and control.
According to him, from 00:00 to 2400 hours on 25 July, 22 new cases of coronary pneumonia confirmed in Urumqi City (5 of which were diagnosed with symptoms) and 38 new non-predicted infections.
As at 2400 hours on 25 July, 135 confirmed cases in the city of Urumqi, 147 cases without symptoms.
The new symptoms of the 25th were largely screened through free nucleic acid testing throughout the city.
Zhang Wei, Director of the Urumqi City Health Commission, stated that most of the free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi City had been largely completed.
He also said that, in other parts of the country, there are many factors affecting the results of nucleic acid detection, such as the detection of reagent sensitivity, the time of infection and detoxification of the tested personnel, the cooperation of the person who was tested when the specimen was taken (which may lead to the lack of access to the specimen) and the detection environment, the operational proficiency of the tester.
For various reasons, nucleic acid tests also have false negative results.
The fake negative means that the person tested is the infected, but the results of the nucleic acid test are negative.
In addition, for confirmed cases, suspected cases have been closely exposed to persons who usually require two nucleic acid tests to be excluded.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if heat and respiratory symptoms occur, a nucleic acid detection of negativeity is possible, so two nucleic acid tests are required to be excluded.
He said that, in view of the above, for the health of the population throughout the city, from today on, the city of Urumqi will conduct secondary free nucleic acid testing of priority areas such as Tianshan, Shaybak district, while conducting "recovering leaks".
According to the information received, the Shaybak district is a high-risk area of the epidemic.

The US-China Trade Talk Representative, pass on the August meeting.
Hong Kong's South China Morning newspaper quoted an anonymous informant who reported that the head of the Chinese Trade Negotiating Team, Deputy Prime Minister of the State Council, Liu Tsuru and the American team, and the trade representative Li Hai Chul, was expected to hold an official meeting in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States.
According to reports, while China has significantly increased the number of United States agricultural products over the past few months, China’s procurement is still a distance from the number of commitments in the trade agreement due to factors such as the new coronary virus epidemic.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other's consulates in the United States, together with other disputes, could undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States entered into force one month after its signature on 15 January, which provides for a high-level trade framework group of the two sides, which shall hold a meeting every six months.
According to the source, the meeting will be an important turning point, allowing both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
But this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China led to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides might agree that the telephone meeting between Lai Hae-chul and Liu Tsuru had met the terms of every six months of the trade agreement.
Since this year, relations between China and the United States have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes that include the origins of the new coronary virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, South China Sea and ideology.
President Trump boasted at the beginning of the year of his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, but has recently changed its attitude.
He said at the White House press conference that although China recently purchased American corn numbers and bought a lot of soybeans, "But this trade agreement now means to me, it's not as good as it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that, due to poor relations between the United States and China, the new round of trade negotiations is unlikely, "trade issues have lost weight in China and the United States".
But he revealed that China's economic and trade-related units still discussed a series of issues on 23rd, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We've tried to buy it, so any additional procurement will be difficult."
Peng Jin, Vice-President of the National Council for Trade, said that maintaining the first phase of the agreement was "more important than ever" and that China had made progress this year to open up financial markets to the United States.
The independent research company Plenum analyst said, "It's better than not, although it may be only routine."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26 July, was informed from the Department of Emergency Management on 26 July that the National Defence Office, the Ministry of Emergency Management, and the National Food and Material Reserve Agency, re-shipment of 135 million knitting bags, 1.2 million square metres of knitting, 130,000 square metres of earthwork, etc., supported by Anhui to fight the flood rescue.
According to the relevant heads of the Department of Emergency Management, the current downstream of the Yangtze River River, which maintains high water fluctuations, and the Yangtze Flood No. 3 of 2020 was formed up on the Yangtze, with risks increased in local areas.
The weather department predicts that there are strong rainfalls in the lower and lower areas of the Yangtze, Guizhou, and the situation remains complex in the next three days.
Since the entry, the Department of Emergency Management deployed the national integrated fire rescue team to pre-set professional rescue forces to the priority areas, participating in 10364 various flood-resistant rescue rescues, which refers to more than 130,000 warmen, 17778 fire trucks, 11887 boats, rescue of 37777 people in distress, evacuated more than 107,000 people trapped.
NASDAQ China District Chief Representative Hao Xing: The best time node for Chinese companies to IPO - Economic Watch - Professional Financial News website
The economic observation network, journalist Zhang Bin, because of the fake coffee, the US market has imposed more severe regulation of the Central General Unit, and the long-term valuation pressure, the pressure on the general stock listed in the United States, the Internet, the Internet, the Kyoto and others, has recently opened a journey back to Hong Kong.
And recently, shell, ideal cars and so on, are on the market.
Is this the best time for Chinese companies to be listed in the United States under the epidemic and the Chinese stock crisis?
"For the recent IPO case and the next company to be listed in the United States, the IPO is essentially not affected, but the market is now very good, even now the best time node for the IPO in the last 10 years. "
The Chief Representative of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange China District, Hao Xin, said at the 2020 Summit of Listing Corporation Leaders, hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the SEC and the United States Public Corporate Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued an "An important role statement on audit quality and regulation of auditing and other international information -- a discussion on the current access to information for United States listed companies with a large number of operations in China".
The statement states that, while international cooperation and coordination has increased significantly in recent years, the problems of United States regulators in access to information remain, and that SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; and, in contrast to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed listed listed listed listed companies that have experienced audit barriers and their audit bodies, with a large number of companies.
In addition, in May this year, the United States Congress Senate passed the Foreign Corporate Accountability Act to provide additional disclosure requirements for foreign companies to be listed in the United States.
In the view of Hao Xing, the crisis of the Chinese stock does not affect the appetite of investors.
"This news just came out of the panic that everyone could go to the United States, and then we found out that these problems were not on the investors, and investors might ask these questions when they went to the IPO road show, even standardized, but it was not an important factor in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that you look at the current situation as usual as possible.
Of course, this surface seems to be the worst in the last two years, but it's not affected by the investors' appetite.
So the tide to the IPO will continue from now until the end of this year or before the U.S. election. "

People's Daily Reviewer: Focus on doing their own things, building new advantages for future development – learning to follow up the important speech of Secretary Xi Jinping at the Entrepreneurs' Symposium - Xinhua Network
Xinhua, Beijing, July 25th, the People's Daily Reviewer's article: Focus on doing their own things, building new advantages for future development.
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain complex, and the challenges facing our development are unprecedented.
Keep strategic strength, build confidence and focus on our own things, and we are key to addressing risk challenges.
At the recent entrepreneurial symposium, General Secretary Xi stressed that in the current environment of the rising protectionism, the world economy’s downturn, the global market shrinking, we must focus on doing our own business, to fully exploit the domestic super-large market advantages, and gradually develop new development patterns that promote each other in the domestic cycle, to upgrade the modernization of industrial chain supply chains, and to promote science and technology innovation, accelerate key core technologies and build new advantages for future development.
The mind of the power, the master wins.
In the external environment of economic globalization, markets and resources "outside" play an important role in our rapid development.
Now, the world under the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable uncertainties, economic globalization is experiencing a reverse and a reverse.
To prepare and prepare for a longer period of response to external environmental changes, and to promote our economy from the wind and to move far away, and one of the most important aspects is to expand and meet domestic needs as a strategic base for development, and to fully realize its own advantages, and to increase the national cycle to drive the economic growth of the world's economy.
We need to realize deeply that we build a complete system of demand, about the long-term development and long-term peace of our country.
The party's central trial is clearly proposing a firm implementation of an expanded domestic demand strategy, which is the need to address the impact of the epidemic, the need to maintain our long-term and healthy development of our economy and to meet the growing lives of the people.
The advantage of the big economy is internal circulation.
We have the most complete and largest industrial system in the world, strong productive capacity, well-developed capabilities, with more than 100 million market subjects and over 170 million people with higher education or professional skills, and 1.4 billion people, including over 400 million middle-income groups, are in the new industrialization, information, urbanization, rapid development of agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
The public system is the subject, the development of multiple ownership economies, distributed to the subject, multiple distributions, the basic socio-economic systems such as the socialist market economic system, which can stimulate both the dynamics of market subjects, liberation and development of social productivity, and promote efficiency and equitable organic unity and achieve common wealth.
We must be firmly aware of the expansion of this strategic base point, making production, distribution and circulation more dependent on the strategic direction of domestic markets, clear the strategic direction of supply-side structural reforms, and promote a dynamic balance of overall supply and overall demand at a higher level.
To accelerate the construction of a complete internal demand system, to advance science and technology and innovation in all other aspects, accelerating strategic emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life health, new materials, creating more new growth points, growth poles, and developing new development patterns based on the domestic cycle, and the national international dual cycle.
Openness brings progress, and closures are bound to lag behind.
Secretary Xi has repeatedly stressed that the doors open in China will not be closed, but will only be bigger.
The main focus of the domestic cycle is not closed, but rather to connect domestic markets and international markets better and better use of two international markets, both international and sustainable development.
At the same time, the expansion of demand and expansion of openness is not contradictory, the smoother the domestic cycle, the more beneficial it is to build new patterns of opening up, the more conducive to new advantages of participation in international cooperation and competition.
Although the international wave of protectionism is rising, we must stand on the right side of history, insist on deepening reform, expand openness, strengthen open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the construction of an open world economy and promote the construction of a community of human destiny.
The Chinese people have experienced many difficulties in history, but have never been crushed, but rather more and more and more brave, growing up in distress, starting with hardship.
On the way forward, there is a strong leader in the central center of Comrade Xi, with a remarkable advantage of the Chinese-specific socialist system, with a strong mobilization and strong combined power, with the unity of all the entire army of the entire army, and we must be able to overcome all the difficult and dangerous obstacles, maintain the momentum of our economic and social development, a comprehensive development of a small society, and a successful opening of a new journey to build a fully modern socialist nation!
The balance's return is "90" instead of "retaliation"?
As the balance returns, "90" not only did not escape the balance, but also "retaliation" saved?
The Chinese Institute of New Economics jointly paid for the "90 and Save" (version 2020) that the first half of the year, "90" was more than 40% more than in 2019.
Interestingly, after 90, it's more inclined to save from a "small money" with 60% of the average amount of less than $20...
Save the money with the balance, and it's a money-saving habit after 90.
Data show that out of the 700 million balance users, 1304 million users are "after 90".
China has 174 million "90 years," which means that about three of the four "90s" in the country are saving money in the balance.
Currently, the 7-day annualized rate of return for IMF, such as balance treasures, has declined from above 2 per cent at the beginning of the year, down to about 1.5 per cent.
Even so, it doesn't affect the pace of saving money after 90.
And in the context of the "saving effect" of the balance, a lot of young people who used to use the balance are also translated directly into "Kimmin".
The payment data shows that as of July 13th, the new "kimin" on the treasure paid for the treasure was more than onefold, and more and more young people had achieved "step" finance on the payment of the treasure.
Analysts believe that the flow of funds from balance to the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the IMF share in June.
The report also shows that "after 90" girls prefer to save more money, on average, 20% higher than boys; 60% of the users who hold funds on the payment platform are men, and women tend to choose a more robust way of financial management than men.
After saving the money, what's the plan for "90"?
Paying data shows that after 90 has a habit of saving money for the target, making travel the most users who save money.
Many after the epidemic are affected by the epidemic, many "90" save money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; cinemas are back open and provide new ways to move from saving money to consumption.

France ' s military input in space - Xinhua Network
French Defense Minister Florence Pally said on 24th that France would add hundreds of euros to the space defence budget to develop space military forces to prevent "unfriendly moves" in other countries in outer space.
Pally told the Provence that day that the budget for French space military projects would increase from the previously proposed Euro3.6 billion (approximately $4.2 billion) to Euro4.3 billion ($5 billion).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update existing observation satellites and communications satellites to launch three electromagnetic detection satellites to improve the modernization of space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Marlon announced last July that the French Air Force would establish the Military Command and the Aviation and Space Force within the French Air Force.
Pali said she would officially announce the establishment of the space force when she visited a military school in Salon, Provence.
Pally said this space force was affiliated with the Air Force, and it was 500 by 2025.
She said, "It was thought that space served the common interests of science, and this idea was gone. Now space is a place for global hegemony."
Pali reiterated the statement before Marlon, stating that the French had no intention to provoke an arms race.
"We are not in an arms race... but I have a responsibility to fully recognize the threat we may face ... "
Pali re-emerged the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She called "peeping" is a Russian satellite.
The Russians deny that.
Pally said France would have a small patrol satellite that can detect and lock "the unfriendly hands behind the back of the move."
The French media believe that France seeks to establish a space force is due to US President Donald Trump last February asking the United States Department of Defense to draft the Space Force bill.
Trump signed the Defence Authorization Act last December to approve the establishment of the Sixth United States Army, the Space Force.
Some experts are concerned that these American initiatives have accelerated the militarization of United States space and could trigger a new space arms race.

It's a construction site for the Three Gorge Tunnels.
China Iron Chengdu Group
On July 26, the Chinese New Net was informed from the Chinese Railway Chengdu Group Group Ltd. on July 26th, that the Zheng Wangau Tunnel, which was about 18.9 km long, was connected to the three canyon tunnel.
It is understood that the Little Three Gorge Tunnels are not only the longest high iron tunnel in the three canyons, but also the longest single-hole high-line high-line high-line high-line tunnel in the country at a speed of 350 km/hour.
Zheng Wan Gao-tae is located in Henan, Hubei, Chongqing Province, and in the north of Zhengzhou, and the arrival of Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou, is an important part of our country's "eight-way" high-speed railway network along the river and the Hunan channel.
Zheng Wan Gao Tung Tsang Tunnel 26 days full of line.
It's a sign of the scene.
Zheng Wan Gao-tae started in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, south-west city, Nanyang City, Hubei Province, to the Wanzhou district of Chongqing City, with a new line of approximately 818 km long, 350 km/hour, approximately 184 km in Chongqing.
Of which, the Zhengzhou to the Yangyang section was operating in the first phase of 1 December 2019, and the Chongqing section was intensifying the construction.
The 26th floor tunnel, which was fully connected to the line, is a full-line control project, located in the border between Bongxi County, Chongqing City, about 18.9 km long, with a maximum of 890 metres deep.
The tunnel began construction in February 2017 and was fully connected on July 26, 2020.
According to the Royal Army, head of the design of the Chinese Iron II Engineering Group Limited, the Royal Army of Zheng Wangau Iron Tunnel Design, where the location of the Three Gorge tunnels is very complex, facing the risks of rock soluble, mud water, soft rock deformation, and is highly difficult to design and construction.
" In the course of the construction of the project, we have adopted a special design programme for more than 30 types of soluble holes... such as the construction of a 24-metre long bridge, over 10 metres of vertical length across the tunnel, large soluble holes above 55 metres deep, avoiding the sinking of tunnels. " The Royal Army says.
According to the construction of the Iron Tunnel Department, the tunnel was built, the tunnel was built, by building a cross-hole smoothing, slurry-blocking, reinforced tunnel structure support and the construction of sewage treatment stations, both ensuring the orderly advance of the project and the destruction of construction drainage to the water bodies of the small three canyon landscape areas, while successfully overcomes the adverse geology such as 7 km of soft rock, with a maximum surge of 157,000 cubic metres of multi-slud water surges per day.
After the construction of the entire line of Zheng Wan Gao, will be the new, easy and fast passenger main route in the south-west region to China, North China, North China, and the north-east region, improving the capacity and quality of railway channels in the south-west region, improving regional network layouts, accelerating the development and urbanization of tourism resources along the line, promoting regional coordinated development and promoting the implementation of the Western development strategy.
Experts say that immigration information is collected through the United States census for unconstitutional distribution of seats in the House.
Some civil rights organizations and several American cities and counties sued the United States federal government, stating that it was also unconstitutional to try to exclude undocumented immigrants from the United States census.
The United States census will determine the distribution of seats in the United States Congress House.
Sarah Brannon, executive lawyer of the League for Civil Rights, said to the American Voice, "This is not gonna work."
She went on to say that Trump asked to determine the citizenship of the people who received the census was difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Another civil society co-operative organization filed a lawsuit on Thursday, challenging the executive order of Trump.
In New Jersey, some cities in Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the lawsuit on Friday.
Garvey, Chairman of the Management Board of Arlington County, said, "The American Constitution requires that our population be accurately cleared every 10 years... and we must clear exactly everyone living in Arlington County, and not to make this illegal attempt to scare and compress our immigration community. "
Other organizations and individuals commended President Trump's executive order.
According to the State Attorney General Marshall of Alabama, the executive order is a victory in the state.
He said, "In the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives of the States, the seats of the House of Representatives and the electoral missions must be based on the number of residents living in the states and are legally resident ... "
The U.S. Supreme Court prevented the Trump administration from integrating citizenship into the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an administrative order earlier this week to regulate data from the United States Census Bureau of Commerce, Ross, to submit data from the undocumented population of the census so that the Administration excluded these undocumented population from the canton census figures to determine whether each state increased or reduced or maintained seats for members of the House of Representatives.
Every 10 years, the United States has to rede the House of Representatives according to demographic changes.

And the province-wide industrial project will advance the enthusiasm of the live watch, covering the three-volt heat, and the "Industry Power, with Project Heroes" is a bright direction of three-story water.
Hunan's development is always based on projects, training industries.
In the first half of the year, under the strong leadership of Comrade Xi Jinping, the province insisted on a game of chess in the province, to fight the disease against two hard wars, and to use industrial projects as a "six-six-six-guard" first-hand game.
GDP fell by 1.9% in the first quarter to 1.3% over the first half of the year, during the period, the great effort, and it was self-evident.
On this precious report card, industrial project construction is a key support for Hunan's accelerated economic recovery and stability.
It's a good thing, it's irreversible.
Industrial projects are built in the big picture, both good at building, stocking, planning, and understanding, changing, changing.
In the context of the current complex and complex situation, in addition to the hard-working offer, there is a need to study the new features of the current new situation, to be more scientific and accurate and better integrated into new development patterns that are driven by the domestic cycle, and the national international dual cycle.
More focus on improving industrial infrastructure.
In the first half of the year, I didn't only have a large number of new industrial heavy-weight investment projects to start, and hope that more traditional advantage industrial enterprises accelerated the spots in digital, intelligent, greening industrial transformation, and falling like flying.
The Iiyang Oscon 3 Science Park Project has adapted existing production lines, high-end printing circuit boards smart production lines take the lead; the new plant of the South China Smoke Changde Smoke Factory is committed to intelligent transformation, building modern plants, and a vivid picture of the "old tree new sprouts" ... around major national strategies and "two new priorities" to consolidate the advantage industry and actively nurture the development of emerging industries, fully increasing technological innovation and national production alternatives, to build a solid foundation and build up transformation.
More focus on new business models for the development of a new economy.
The sudden new coronary epidemic, which brought about the redest of the cloud economy, inspired the potential of the digital economy to provide new opportunities for industrial change: in the first half of the year, the manufacturing of electronics and communications equipment, the manufacturing of electronics and communications equipment, the number of online retail sales for wholesale retail enterprises increased by 32.2 per cent over the same period, and the income of online meals for catering enterprises increased by 35.6 per cent over the same period.
New machines in crisis, start a new game in the change, actively promoting digital industrialization, industrial digitization, and leading the development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Greater focus on optimizing and stable industrial chain supply chains.
Engineering machinery is the main force of the Hunan industry, but two thirds of the associated companies are outside the province, and there are still space and potential in the chain.
Strengthening the industrial chain thinking capture project, not only does it require a continuous accumulation of head enterprises, but also to achieve technological breakthroughs at key parts of the industrial chain; it is also needed to be nurtured everywhere to stimulate the chain chain to stimulate a chain of chain-locking, promoting a synergetic layout of the associated industries and accelerating the construction of autonomous and manageable industrial chain supply chains.
It's a business, Hunan is still a good business environment, a hot land for market business opportunities, a land of music.
The whole province has been making new moves, making a real move, and think that the "accumeration" of high-quality development is a "expanding" service for the enterprise, and the policy is not compromised, and the problem is solved at night... in the process of recovery of the damage caused by the epidemic, looking for short-board pain points, achieving a living story that is at risk.
A research industry, nurturing industries, developing industries, solid optimization of business environments, and will win more investors' favors.
The wind ahead is still there, but the state of wind break has become the construction of industrial projects throughout the province to advance high-quality development.
In this critical period, it is important to learn to implement the spirit of the important instructions of the General Secretary of Xi to respond effectively to external uncertainty with the certainty of its own work, and to promote industrial projects, to promote industrial projects, to sweat together, ensure the success of the 13th and the full construction of a small society.

As the epidemic has improved, the production order of life throughout society continues to recover.
The party's center insists on the overall tone of progress, further increasing macro-policy hedges, fully strengthening employment priority policies and actively promoting the steady growth of employment.
Our policy is increasing its policy against positions, and has launched a "reducing relief" policy portfolio, a phase-off reduction of three social insurance units, allowing for the extension of social insurance fees, expanding the return of unemployment insurance insurance for small and medium-sized micro-enterprises, benefiting from the labour training policy, subsidies for the employment of priority groups by enterprises, etc.
As the steady employment policies are implemented, the demand for business workers has steadily improved, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the unemployment rate in urban surveys has declined, and in June, the unemployment rate was 5.7 per cent.

However, the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly evident.
According to epidemic control, logistics delays throughout the country were delayed throughout the country in January and in a timely manner, increased costs of material transport, plus some citizens hoarding and rising prices for some essentials.
In response to the disruptions caused by the outbreak prevention and control of the price situation, the authorities have integrated important living materials into emergency transport security to ensure that material transport is smooth.

As an artist, contact is very important to me.
I try to explain through my art that humans are not separated from nature, but everything is connected.
I first went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and for the first time I saw icebergs.
I'm afraid.
My heart is moving fast, dizzy, trying to understand what this is in front of me.
I can only feel strange that a snowflakes cover another snowflake, and it's formed year after year.
The icebergs are formed when they break from glaciers or break off the ice shelf.
Every iceberg has their own unique personality.
They interact with their surroundings and their circumstances in a clear way.
Some icebergs refuse to compromise and stick to the end, and others can't stand falling apart under a violent passion.
When you see icebergs, it's easy to think that they're isolated, they're independent, separate, more like our humans sometimes think about themselves.
But reality is much more than that.
As the iceberg melts, I breathe to its old smell.
As the iceberg melts, it releases fresh water of minerals, and they feed everything.
I started filming these icebergs like I was filming my ancestors' portraits, and I learned that at these individual moments, the iceberg existed in that way, but it would never exist again.
When they melt, it's not death; it's not an end, but a continuation of the path to life.
I filmed icebergs, some ice is very young -- thousands of years old.
Some ice is over 100,000 years.
The last picture I want to show you was a iceberg I took on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
It's a very rare opportunity to see a iceberg roll.
So that's what the figure shows.
You can see a little boat on the left.
It's a boat about 15 feet.
I want you to notice the shape of the iceberg that it's deformed on the surface.
Here you see it start rolling, the boat moves to the other side, a man standing there.
It's an average size of Greenland iceberg.
It floats about 120 feet high or 40 meters high.
This video was taken in real time.
Like this iceberg, they show you different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.

Green Land Holdings have conducted several institutional institutional reforms since its inception: 1992-1997, in accordance with marketing rules under the pure state-owned system; 1997-2013, established and continuously improved the shares of State-owned holdings and employees; 2013-2015, the introduction of strategic investors, forming cross-stock shares of state-owned and non-public capital, mixed ownership systems; and from 2015 to date, as a whole, became a public company.
The current mix programme in Greenfield is similar to Gly, and in December 2019, the high-level capital led by Chuhai Ming, which took over 15 per cent of the shares of the G.I.L.L.L.L.L.G. retreating small shareholders, and after completing the mix, the G.I.E. Electrics implemented modern business management methods such as the executive incentive scheme, the uncontroller structure.
Shanghai Property, Shanghai City, which is owned by the Shanghai City National Council, the Chairman of Green Land Holdings, and President Zhang Yu Liang, stated that Shanghai was a major initiative in Shanghai to advance the comprehensive reform of State-owned State enterprises in accordance with the central request of the party, accelerating the reform of the new phase of State-owned State-owned State enterprises, which fully demonstrated the new idea of reform for the reform of land-based and tailor-degrading clothing, by introducing new strategic shareholders to listed companies to further increase marketization and increase the freedom of business management and accelerate the full release of reform.
The first cross-saving car tour in the country was launched - Xinhua Network
On July 25th, Xinhua, Hangzhou, at 1220 hours, on 25 July, over 200 Shanghai tourists on the D771 motor vehicle, successfully arrived in Lanbrook, Zhejiang Province, and since the Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed the cross-state (region, city) team tour in the country on July 14, the first cross-saving car tour in the country.
The site is located in Lanbrook, in the Midwest of Zhejiang, with a number of winning sites in Zhuge Gosipura, underground river, Chi-gu village, and over 200 Shanghai tourists will draw these sites on a two-day trip.
Lee Lee, Deputy Managing Director, Shanghai Railways International Tourism (Group) Ltd., said that, according to the latest policy, focused on cross-saving travel needs, contacted Lanbrook, and carefully launched Shanghai to Lanbrook and Summer 2 Days, which were sold out less than a week.
Aunt Sun from Shanghai said that the epidemic never went out this year.
"For a long time at home, when we see a team trip, share the news with friends, never came to Lanbrook before, and I looked forward to this trip. "
It is understood that last September, Lanbrook City signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Shanghai Railways International Tourism (Group) Ltd., which plans to open 12 high iron tourism to Lanbrook within a year.
I hit myself?
The White House consultant, "The Anti-Bite" states are too early to work.
The White House consultant, "The Anti-Bite" states are too early.
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, or 30 per cent of the world's cases.
For months, President Trump has repeatedly asked the states of the country to resume their studies until recently, to change their attitude and to wear masks in public, and his consultant called some state governments too early.
On 22nd, the White House presidential adviser, Kelly Conway, stated at a press conference that some state governments did not comply with re-entry standards and restarted bars too early.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the President had "absolute power" to decide on the re-entry of the states is a false rumor.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes that the states have autonomy. "
She argued for Trump.
However, the rumor in Conway's mouth was told by Trump at the White House outbreak briefing on April 13.
The self-faced operation was mocked by the Internet as "rewrite history".
Karen Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Grechen Whitmer a dictator because she followed the medical code and insisted on the suspension.
Trump wants to get back to work so he can hold a rally.
This is not Karen Conway's first controversial.
On April 15, Conway, in an interview with Fox News, came out of his mouth: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, my friends!"
She seems to have understood "19" as a version number, and she was crazy by the Internet: read the papers without common sense!
Recently, we've seen the impact of cyber attacks on the commercial world.
Data leaks like Morgan Chase, Yahoo, Jiabo and Tagit's department stores have led to hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars.
And then a few more attacks, the whole world economy will collapse.
The public domain is not spared.
From 2012 to 2014, the American Management Office had a very serious data leak.
Security clearance and fingerprinting information were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may have heard that some government-funded hackers, trying to use stolen data to influence the results of the election in some countries.
The last two, one of the German Bundesies, a massive data theft, was stolen by the National Council of the United States Democratic Party.
Cyber threats have affected our democratic process.
And there's a growing trend.
The more sophisticated computer technology, the more vulnerable we use to protect data.
Especially a new computer technology called quantum computers, which uses the microparticle of nature to significantly increase computer computing capabilities.
It's a powerful ability to crack many encryption systems we use today.
So, are we hopeless?
Shouldn't we start packing up electronic survival equipment to meet the end of the coming data?
I don't think it's that far.
Quantum computers are only in the lab, and it takes years to actually use.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in the encryption field.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of safe communications.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we unlocked new skills, creating quantum effects that don't exist in nature.
Using the basic laws of physics to advance encryption technology, which makes me excited.
Today, some selected companies and laboratories, including me, have pushed this technology to the stage of practical application.
Yeah.
We're going to use quantum to fight quantum.
How do we get this done?
First, let's get a quick understanding of the encrypted world.
You need a briefcase, and you have some important documents to give your best friend James Bond, to lock it up and keep it safe.
Because these materials are top secret, we're going to use a super-advanced briefcase.
It has a special password lock, and once locked, it converts the contents of the file to random numbers.
So you just put the file in, lock it, and the file has been converted to random numbers, and you give this briefcase to James.
When the briefcase wasn't delivered, you called him the code.
Once he gets the briefcase, enter the password, the file is deciphered, it's perfect, and you successfully passed a encrypted message to James Bond.
A funny example, but it shows three points of encryption.
Password -- we call it encrypted keys.
You can imagine it as a code.
Tell James the code.
We call it a key transfer.
It's a guarantee that we can safely send the secret key to the designated location.
And the locks used to encrypt and decrypt files.
We call it encryption algorithms.
By key, it converts the contents of the file to random numbers.
A good algorithm can do that, and it's hard to crack the password without a key.
The importance of algorithms is that if someone gets a briefcase, open it, no key, no encryption algorithm, no reading the contents of the document.
Just some random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure key transfer, passing the key to the right place.
However, rapidly growing computing capabilities endanger many of the secret key transmissions we're using.
For example, we now apply a very wide range of systems - RSA.
It took about 40 million years to crack a 426-bit RSA key when it was invented in 1977.
And in 1994, it was only 17 years later, the code was broken.
As computers get stronger, we need longer passwords.
Now we use 2048 or 4096-bit passwords.
As you can see, the battle between the encryption and the decryptor is in progress, and they want to beat each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, quantum computers will break complex mathematical algorithms faster, which are the basis for the encryption system we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our safe castle into a card house that is touching.
We're gonna try to protect our castle.
In recent years, many research institutions have emerged to study how to use quantum effects to enhance encryption.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the three main points of encryption, high-quality secret keys, secure key transmissions and strong algorithms.
However, progress in science and engineering has already affected two of these priorities.
The first thing to do is the key.
Random numbers are the basis for the key.
But today, they're not really random anymore.
At present, we generate a secret key, based on random digital frequency, generated by software, we call it pseudo-random numbers.
The numbers generated by programs or mathematical methods, there are always some, perhaps not so obvious patterns in it.
The lower the randomness of these numbers, the lower the term, the lower the twilight, the easier they are to be predicted.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked, and the way the attack was creative.
They shot the tiger machine for a while, and then they analyzed it.
Cyber criminals use reverse engineering to create a pseudo-random digital generator behind the wheel.
So they'll have a lot of chances of predicting the turn of the wheel, and they make a lot of money.
The key is equally unsafe.
Having a real random digital generator is important for generating secure passwords.
For years, researchers have been trying to make real random digital generators.
But most designs are either not random, either fast enough or hard to repeat.
But the world of quantum is really random.
It's important to use this real randomity.
The device that can measure quantum effects can generate very quickly, continuous random digital streams.
There's no possibility of a casino crime.
Several universities and companies from around the world are focusing on making real random digital generators.
In my company, our quantum random digital generator was born at a 2-metre-long optical table.
Then we narrow it down to a box size.
By today, we can put it on a PCI card, plug it in a normal computer.
This is the fastest, really random digital generator in the world.
It can generate 1 billion random numbers per second by measuring quantum effects.
Today has been widely used around the world to enhance the security of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
But even with the real random digital generator, we're facing the second largest cyber security threat: that's the security transmission of the key.
The current key transfer technology cannot fight quantum computers.
And the quantum solution for this problem, called quantum key distribution, known as QKD, uses quantum mechanics to violate instinctive properties.
Watching microparticle behavior changes the particle.
I'll give you an example.
Let's think about it again, and give the code to James Bond.
But this time, we don't call him, we use quantum effects, carry this password with a laser, pass it to James through a normal fibre.
We assume Dr. Nobb wants this code.
Fortunately, Dr. No, in trying to intercept this quantum key, leaves electronic fingerprints, and James and you can notice.
The key that's intercepted will be disabled.
And the key left behind can provide powerful protection for data.
Because this security mechanism is based on physics fundamentals, quantum computers, or any future supercomputer, can't crack it.
My team and I are working with many top universities and defense departments to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of safety products.
The Internet is a sign of the coming of a highly interconnected era, and it is expected that 25-30 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020.
To think that our society works in the world of the Internet, trust in these interconnected equipment systems is essential.
We believe that quantum technology is very important for building this trust, and it will ensure that we enjoy these magical innovations, and enjoy these innovations that will enrich our lives.
Thank you.

Three-year-old children's college playgrounds were hit, and then they're gonna sue the school after they get paid?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Journal of Law by Wang Si-seok Responsible Editor: Wang Si-seok
The playground was smashed, the children were paid for it.
Zhao Yifan, correspondent of the newspaper
Three-year-old Man was accidentally hit by Chen of the softball team when he was playing at a college playground.
After Chen's compensation, Mr. Wen's father, Mr. Wen, told the school to the court as a legal agent for the court, requesting an apology at the school at the place of conduct and paid medical expenses, mental damage comfort, etc. $20,000.
Recently, the Beijing Haidian People ' s Court held that the school had set up a net at the playground at the time of the incident, and that Chen had paid for compensation and dismissed the plaintiff's request for proceedings.
Mr. Wen complained that during the summer of 2019, he took Xiao Man to play at the school playground, when the base team was training at the playground.
To avoid the risks posed, Mr. Wen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents are active in safe areas designated by the soft run team.
But then the softball team, Chen, took off his hand while he threw the ball, and led softball to fly the net to the security area and hit the micro-brain brain.
Mr. Wen immediately took Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed as head injury.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium are not in line with the relevant security requirements and did not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The school's fault caused the above-mentioned incidents, causing great physical and mental suffering from the small text, while causing greater pain in their families, and should be legally responsible for this school.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a network of protection in the playground and posted management regulations, training notifications, informed that access to the playground had to maintain a safe distance from the training site and to remind itself of its safety, and that the plaintiff could not prove that the school was "unending to safety and security obligations", so he did not agree to compensation.
After the court, the court held that the subject of the incident was the subject of the university free of charge to the public, and that, while schools had a security obligation to manage the playground, but that security obligation would only require general obligations of attention.
The school set up a net at the playground at the time of the incident, and Chen has made appropriate security obligations and Chen has paid over $2,000 for medical expenses, transportation costs, etc., in accordance with previous compensation agreements, and the parties agreed to settle the dispute for one-time settlement.
After that, the parents of Xiao Wen again claimed compensation for school compensation, and the court ruled that the court ruled to reject all the plaintiff's claims.
After the sentence, neither party had appealed, and the judgement was now in force.
According to article 37 of our Act on Tort Liability, schools, as administrator of public places, have a safety and security obligation; in the case of third person ' s actions, third parties shall be liable for violations and that the public place administrator who has not exhausted the obligation to security and security shall be liable accordingly.
The judge stated that, as the administrator of public places, it was most likely to know the actual situation of the site as a whole, the risk and damage that could occur, it was most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent or mitigate damage and to avoid and mitigate the lowest costs of damage, the law provides for the corresponding safeguards obligation to engage in social activities.
In this case, the safety and security obligation to enter persons that are not specific to the public free access to the public shall be adapted to the social activities they engage in, specifically, basic security measures and are obliged to inform hidden risks.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to over-security and security obligations for people in public places.
If the school has already taken a net to set up a net and to do its duty to inform, it is possible to determine that the school is not wrong and shall not be legally liable.
Moreover, for third-party violations, even if managers in public places such as schools are not exhausted to safety and security obligations, their responsibility is a supplement to damages, and the managers may pursue third persons after additional liability under the latest Civil Code.
In such accidents, the victim should not expand the range of claims after receiving compensation for direct violations ...
Today I want to show you the way we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be able to assemble ourselves, replicate and self-rehabilitation.
So I'm going to show you the current state of manufacturing I think, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years, half a million parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines, which can take us into space -- five years, 2.5 million parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million types of protein that can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, and we can copy DNA with 3 billion base pairs in about an hour.
That's the complexity of our natural system, but they're very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, more complicated than anything we can build.
They're more efficient in energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can fix themselves for a long life.
There's something super interesting about the natural system.
If we can convert it into our building environment, then the way we build things will have great potential.
I think the point is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we're building -- our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of our architecture.
And then we need a programmable part of this part that can accept this sequence and use it to fold or recreate.
We need some energy to activate, so that our parts can fold according to the program.
We need some kind of error redundancy to ensure that all we build is what we want.
So I'm going to show you some of the projects I'm working with my colleagues to achieve this self-assembly future.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale re-engineered robots -- 8 feet, 12 feet long protein.
They're embedded in electromechanical equipment, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold, decode it into a series of angles -- negative 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, and this kind of stuff; a series of angles, or turning, which can pass this order with wires.
Each unit gets its own message -- negative 120, it rotates, check if it rotates to place and pass the sequence to its neighbors.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, designers working for this project.
I think this project really reveals that this is really scalable?
I mean, thousands of people spend thousands of people making this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? Can we really embed robots in every part?
The next question is, look at passiveity, or passively trying to make reorganization programmable.
But it's a step further, it's trying to calculate it.
It's basically embedded in the basic construction module of most calculations, digital logic doors, directly into the various parts.
It's with the non-door.
Each door to calculate has a quadrilateral, two input quadrilaterals.
One of them is input from the user, like you're building bricks.
The other one was the input of a brick that was put before coming.
And then it gives a three-dimensional space output.
That means users build bricks in the way they want.
It's calculated according to what you did and your instructions.
Now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- up or down.
Look at the left, [1,1] input equals zero output, which means down.
On the right, the input is 1 output, which means up.
So the real meaning is that our structure now contains the blueprints we want to build.
So the information about what you want to build is embedded.
That means we have some kind of self-repliction.
In this case, I call it self-directive reproduction, because your structure contains precise blueprints.
If you have a mistake, you can replace a part.
All local information is embedded in it and tells you how to fix it.
So you have something to climb, read it and one output.
It's directly embedded; no external command input.
The last project I'm going to show is called the Cardiac Chain, which is probably the most exciting example of passive self-assembly systems we're seeing.
It's reconstructable and programmable, making it a complete passive system.
Basically, you have a series of elements.
Each element is exactly the same, and they're partial.
Each chain, or each element wants to turn right or turn left.
If you want to assemble a chain, you need to program it.
Tell each unit to turn left or right.
When you shake this chain, it folds up to program any structure you encoded for -- so in this case, a spiral, fire, two connected cubes.
Basically you can program in 3D space -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- the chain is completely passive.
What future is this for us?
I think it tells us about the possibility of self-assembly, self-replicing and self-rehabilitation in our body structure, our buildings and machines.
There's new programmable in these parts.
You can get a new possibility of calculating.
We'll have space to calculate.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, all the bricks can be calculated.
What a surprising parallel computing and distributed computing capability and new design possibilities.
It's an exciting potential.
I think these projects I'm showing you are just a small step towards the future, if we achieve these new technologies for a new self-assembly world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The heat of people's sports and fitness has increased under the normalization of the epidemic.
As the cross-provincial tourism business is gradually liberalized, the tourism market is about to recover.
Fujian Province resumed cross-provincial tourism operations since July 21st, and the first weekend after opening, the peak of the client peak as a tourist destination.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are a lot of tourists who arrive at Xiamen on weekends.
The station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers, while airport traffic is dominated by students, tourism, visits.
The tourism market is warming, and in July, 440 times a day at Xiamen Airport, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of the pre-emergency.
The airline encrypts the air speed lines in major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Sian, taking over the recovery tourism market.
Currently, several travel agencies in Xiamen have been on a series of summer-based cross-saving products, with team travel mainly based on outdoor sites.
In response to railway stations, the summer passenger peak at the airport, the relevant units have increased their hands in areas where people are easily gathered on the platform, security access, etc., and Fujian also optimized the "eight health codes" to achieve health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, promoting an order recovery in the tourism market.
Can Liu Dehua Liu Qingyun "open" out of the new sparks - Xinhua Network
Bombing Specialist 2 recently announced that it would be released on December 24th as the first-class film in the He's age.
The second is still director of Qui Litao, the producer and lead director of Liu De Wa, with a new story.
According to the information received, the addition of the second "nuclear bomb" element has also made the challenge facing this bomb-breaking expert more difficult, warning of a few amazing glimpses, which has been so exciting, the big explosion of mushroom clouds, the airport that was swallowed by the fire, and the scene was quite shocking.
Three years ago, the bomb-breaking expert, produced by the original horse, won the five-one ticket house champion of the year and won seven nominations for the Hong Kong Film Gold Image Award, and Qiu Litao Liu Dehua became a gold partner in the audience's heart.
This time, the bomb-breaking expert 2, is also looking forward to the new sparks for the ace combination.
The bomb removal expert 2 tells a new story: the former bomb-breaking expert, Pan, fainted at the bombing scene and was classified as a suspect by the police.
To find the truth, he had to ask for help from Dong Cheuk-wen, a friend of the bomb-breaking expert.
The woman who was anxious to solve the case was also involved in Pan's ex-girlfriend.
Still a bomb-breaking expert, but the complexity of Liu De Wa's new role is felt from the final forecast: broken a leg, wearing a limb, and was hunted down by Liu Qingyun, who was also directed by former girlfriend Nini.
What's the relationship between the three, what did Liu De Wa do at the Shan Island Hotel and what kind of case was involved in what kind of case he had in the bomb-breaking expert's career, and what kind of a mystery was curious.
It is understood that the film's big play is a world landmark building in Hong Kong, with the top special effects production team, which brings a shock to real visual shocks.

The Chinese New Net, July 26, the Integrated Russian Satellite Network reported that July 26th was Russian Navy Day, the main parade to celebrate Navy Day in St. Petersburg and Kalunstadt.
The Russian President, Putin, the Supreme Commander of the Russian Federal Armed Forces, arrived in Kalunstadt for the celebration, and 15 ships and submarines were examined.
Local time, July 28, 2019, St. Petersburg, Russia, held a great parade to celebrate the Navy Day.
Putin reportedly congratulated Navy officials on Navy Day and on a boat next to the ship that is about to attend the sea parade in the Gulf of Finland, and then to be examined at the subjective protocol desk.
Putin says the Russian naval fleet has the latest ships and special equipment, and the level of equipment is increasing.
Putin said on the Russian Navy Day parade: "The Russian naval fleet has warships equipped with high-precision weapons, strategic dive cruisers and multipurpose submarines, latest aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment. "
On June 24, local time, Russia commemorates the 75th anniversary of the victory of the war in the U.S. War.
He also said that the Russian naval fleet would gain unique advantages by digital and effective defense.
Reports indicate that the main naval parades to celebrate Russian Navy Day were held in St. Petersburg and Kalunstadt, with 46 ships participating, including Admiral Casatonov, the large anti-submarine of the Navy, and large landing vessels, small missile ships, frigates, submarines, etc.
Among them, the series of ships conducted static displays by the Winter Palace Bridge in St. Petersburg, the most striking of which was replicated at the first Russian warship, Poltava, in the early 18th century.
To avoid the spread of the new coronary virus, only local residents and special guests were able to enter Kalunstadt during the naval parade this year.
The last Sunday of July is Russian Navy Day.
Yang Hong, founder of the Beijing Philharmonic, died in the year, 86 years old, and the new network was 86 years old.
On 26 July, the Beijing Ale Choir published a obituary, a famous Chinese commander, a music educator, a lifelong academic member of the Central Music Academy, Professor Yang Hong, who died in Beijing at 1355 hours on 26 July 2020 and was 86 years old.
Image by Beijing's Lover Network.
Yang Hong was born in 1934, Jiangsu Nanking, who loved music since he was young.
In 1951, he was the Nanjing People's Radio Choir team, and was admitted to the Shanghai Department of Music in the autumn of 1951, where he studied the command from Professor Yang Ka-in and the German commander, and studied the song and re-reading forward Soviet expert Alzamanov.
In 1958, Faculty of Music, Beijing Arts Teacher Training College, was transferred to the Faculty of Composers of the Central Music Institute in 1973, with the Department of Command.
Yang Hong founded the Beijing Love Choir in 1983.
For more than 30 years, he has led this choir all over the world with the purpose of "love and dedication" and won dozens of prizes in important competitions at home and abroad.
He was in charge of the Central Orchestra, the Central National Dance Group, the Eastern Dance Group, the Shanghai Choir, and held several symphony concerts and choir concerts.
The book is "The Band Training", "Singing Training", "Second Song Writing", "The Children's Songs" and "The Sing of the Sing" and "The Sing of the Sing" and "The Sound Level Layout of the Orchestra", and "The Sing of the Sing" and "The Voice Language of Debussy".
Do you know how many flower plants are there?
There are 250,000 species -- at least we know so much -- 250,000 flower plants.
And flowers are a problem.
It's really hard to grow plants.
It takes a lot of experience and many resources.
Why is it so troubled?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, sex.
I know what you think when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important -- plants have many other ways to breed.
It can be plug-in; it can be the same sex; it can be pollination.
But they do need to spread their genes mixed with other genes, so they can be ecological.
That's how evolution works.
Now the way plants pass this information through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a scanning electron microscope that can see these.
There are many different types of pollen that are blooming plants.
It's actually quite useful for forensics and so on.
Most of them will cause pollen from plants that spread pollen with wind, which is a very inefficient process, and that's why pollen always runs into our noses.
Because most of them are abandoned, hoping to be included in pollen, male reproductive cells, will happen to fall on another flower.
All grass, which means all grain, and most trees spread pollen by wind.
But most species actually use insects to do this process, and in a way it's smarter, because it doesn't require too much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen, move pollen directly to where they need.
Obviously, we noticed the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship, whether birds or bees, and they get a reward, and usually the reward is nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship can lead to wonderful adaptive changes -- red skirt moths are a beautiful adaptive change.
Plants have harvests, and the twilight spreads pollen elsewhere.
Plants evolve, create landing runways everywhere, bees may be lost.
Some of the plants look like other insects.
These are lilies' pollen bags, very clever, so when the uninformed insects fall on it, the pollen bag flips over and hit a lot of pollen on the back of the insect, so that insects can follow insects to other plants.
There's a orchid that looks like a jaw, and in a way, it does; it forces insects to climb, put pollen and bring pollen somewhere else.
Orchids: At least 20,000 orchids -- amazingly diverse.
They have all kinds of tricks.
They must try and attract polluters to help them complete the process.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, was studied by Darwin and gave wonderful predictions when he saw this orchid, and you can see a long nectars down from the orchid.
Basically what insects have to do is -- we come to the flower -- it stabbed the mouth into the middle part of the corner, knowing the nectar tube down to get nectars.
Darwin said, "Look at the flower, "I guess something has evolved with it."
No doubt, it's insects.
I mean, usually it's all rolling up, but it's straight after, it looks like this.
Now imagine if nectars are so valuable to produce plants at a high cost and attract many polluters, then, as in human sex, people may start cheating each other.
They might say, "I have some nectar.
It's a plant.
This plant is loved by South African insects, and they evolved long mouthrs to get honey at the bottom.
It's a imitator.
This plant is imitating the previous plant.
There's a fly with a long mouth, which doesn't get any nectars from the fakes, because the fake didn't give it any nectars, and it thought it could get it.
So, not only flies don't get nectars from fake plants, and -- if you're very close to the top of the head, you'll see some pollen there will be spread to other plants, and if no botanists come and stick it to a blue card.
This lie is all over the plant kingdom.
This flower with black dots: they may look like black spots to us, but I tell you that for the male insects of the right species, it looks like two very, very sexy females.
When insects arrive and land on it, they soak themselves in pollen, of course, they will be taken to other plants, and if you look at the images of the scanning electron microscope that every family should have, you can see some patterns, three-dimensional patterns.
It even makes insects feel comfortable, and it looks good.
These electron microscope images -- this is a orchid disguised as an insect -- and you can see different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures for our eyes, and insects may feel very, very different textures.
This orchid evolved to imitating the surface of metal light in some beetles.
Under scanning the electron microscope, you can see this surface -- it's very different from the other surfaces we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even if we look like insects.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful and magical thing.
It's a smart thing.
I think it's sometimes cunning.
For the right kind of bees, it looks like another very aggressive bee, and it flies over with his head to hit it many times, trying to drive it away, of course, it'll put it on pollen.
Another thing it does is that this plant imitates another orchid with insect-loved food.
But there's nothing.
So it's cheating on two levels -- incredible.
What we see is Ilan, with a strong scent.
Actually, I smell it before.
These flowers don't really have to be so beautiful.
They spread wonderful scents to attract any interested insects.
This flower doesn't smell much.
This flower actually smells very bad, and again, it's evolution, it looks like rotting meat.
So flies like it.
The flies fly in and help them pollination.
This is White Star Potato, also known as Dead Horse Potato.
I don't know what a dead horse smells like, but this flower may smell very much.
It's horrible.
Greenhead flies can't help it.
Fly into it, fly all the way into it.
It lay eggs up there, it's a nice piece of rotting meat, and they don't realize that there's no eggs here, but at the same time this plant will benefit, because the hard hair is loose, the fly disappears, pollating to another flower -- it's amazing.
It's a potato plant, O'Haita, Zephyr Aro, in this country, called the grass of the age.
I filmed this last week in Dosset.
This guy's heating up about 15 degrees higher than the ambient temperature -- incredible.
If you look inside it, the meat is a little like a dam, and flies attract heat -- a boiling volatile chemical, bug -- they're trapped under this container.
They drink sweet nectars and then they get a little sticky.
At night, they were covered by pollen, sprayed by them, and then the hard hair we saw up there became dead and they escaped -- and it was incredible.
If you think it's incredible, this one is my favorite.
It's spring feathers.
People from Brazil should know this plant.
It's the most amazing thing.
It's about a foot long.
It has a ability I know that no other plant has, and when it blooms -- it's in the middle of the meat -- about two days, it's causing some degree of metabolic change, some kind of mammals.
And there's no starch, it's plant food, it has very brown fat stuff burning it at a rate of burning fat, metabolic, about a cat speed.
By weight ratio, it's twice the energy output of the hummingbird -- absolutely amazing.
It did something unusual.
Not only will it warm up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Celsius, two days, but it will keep it warm.
One of them is a temperature adjustment mechanism to keep the temperature.
Why would you do that? I heard you ask.
You don't know yet, some beetles like to mate at this temperature.
They're drilled in, covered with pollen.
Plants are full of pollen on them, let them go, pollination.
What a wonderful thing.
Now we think that most polluters are insects, but in the tropical areas, many birds and butterflies also do powder.
Many tropical flowers are red, because butterflies and birds are similar to us, and we think that it's very good to see red.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see all kinds of dark ultraviolets.
There's some color behind this.
"If we can see those colors isn't good," I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see it.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert lotus, half-day flowers, in Dosset.
As we can see, these are little yellow flowers, and there are little yellow flowers everywhere.
It looks like this in the visible light.
If the red is removed, it looks like this.
Most bees can't feel red.
And then I put an ultraviolet filter in front of my camera at a specific frequency of ultraviolet light for a long time, and I got this picture.
It's like a real wonderful target.
Now we don't know what bees see, and when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We can't know what happened, whether it's insects, or in the brain of other humans.
But the contrast looks like this.
This is another flower -- in different ultraviolet frequency zones, different filters to match different powderers.
It looks like this.
To avoid you think that all yellow flowers have this attribute -- no damage to flowers during the shoot; just put it on the tripod, not off -- in ultraviolet light, look at this.
It's the basis for sunscreen, because sunscreen works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemicals are useful.
Finally, it's a night-long scent that Bjorn Rorslett sent me -- a wonderful hidden pattern.
I like this hidden way.
These pictures are taken in ultraviolet filters, and the main use of this filter is that astronomers use to film Venus -- actually the clouds on Venus.
It's the main use of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and fertility, which is the word of flowers.
As the flowers spend so much effort trying to attract polluters to accept their invitations, and somehow they have succeeded in believing that it contains a rich meaning that we send flowers from each other when we were born and died, especially when you think of it, in this moment, genetic matter moved from an organism to another.
Thank you very much.

Paper mills, chemical plants, farms, and pollution of river water along the Dragon Creek River.
By 2007, in 2008, the Dragon Creek had become a stinking ditch.
"The fish scales caught are black and black when it's spread."
Li Dae-guk says it's getting harder to fish after the river is contaminated.
The locals began to manage the pollution of the Dragon Creek, including drifting, river cruises, aquatic resource management, etc.
Li Dae-guk also withdrew from fishermen and became a member of the river patrol, managing aquatic resources.

Israel has strengthened its repeated control over the epidemic
In the early stages of the new coronary pneumonia outbreak, Israel's defence measures had been significantly effective.
However, with the gradual release of defence measures, the number of new coronary pneumonia diagnosis in Israel has recently increased significantly, and the Israeli Government has taken several urgent measures to strengthen the prevention of the epidemic.
On 28 February, the first new case of coronary pneumonia was diagnosed in Israel to quickly take the closure of all entry and exit ports, suspending non-necessary industries, schools were changed to online teaching, limiting public transport and unnecessary social activities, blocking serious cities of the epidemic, joint maintenance and control initiatives.
This series of measures had soon been positive, and by mid-May, the number of new cases of new coronary pneumonia confirmed cases in Israel had once returned to one-day.
As the epidemic is controlled, Israeli defence measures are completely unenclosed, and since June, the number of new confirmed new coronary pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially after July, the spread of the epidemic is accelerating.
Recently, Israel has more than eight days of new cases per day, with 916 new cases as of 25 July.
As of 25 July, 59745 confirmed cases in Israel and 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli Government has taken several urgent measures to strengthen the control of the epidemic.
On 6 July, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed down public entertainment sites such as gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and introduced a policy of limiting public transport, requiring that passengers per bus cannot exceed 20 people.
On 17th, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including the weekend of the "Closed City", which provides for the implementation of the "sealed city" between Friday and 5 p.m. per week.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centres, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets, pharmacies will remain open.
Meanwhile, within all dates and times, more than 10 people are prohibited, gymnasiums, studios, etc. will be closed, restaurants and cafes are prohibited, and only take-out services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli population has not given sufficient attention to the gravity of the epidemic and has not been able to work with the Government in combating the epidemic.
After the repeated Israeli epidemic, many people went to the street protest for government defence measures affecting their economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of demonstrations in Tel Aviv considered that anti-disease policies affected the economy.
On the evening of 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the residence of Prime Minister Netanyahu in Jerusalem, protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu ' s ban on restaurants, coffee shop food, etc.
In addition, many people did not comply with masks, maintaining two metres of safe social distance, etc., in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people wear masks on their chins or hanging on their wrists.
During the outbreak, schools were a heavy disaster zone for the spread of the new coronary virus, while journalists recently found that the kindergarten teachers and students had not worn masks as required by the government, nor maintained two metres of safe social distance from each other, buried a large number of teachers and students infected with a large number of teachers and students.
Professor Elly Waxman, member of the National Security Council of the Israeli National Security Council, believes that Israel is moving towards the "risk situation", noting that the epidemic control measures currently taken by Israel are not enough to close all leisure, recreational activities and summer schools to control further proliferation of the epidemic.
Vaxman stated that Israel ' s lack of a general plan to combat the epidemic, and that Parliament and government departments should abandon their interests as soon as possible and to agree on the issue of the epidemic and to develop clear steps, including relevant restrictions in different sectors.
The newspaper Tel Aviv, on July 25th, the newspaper's journalist in Tel Aviv, Wang Zheng.
Ningxia's farmer Wu Feng Fong, who was a former companion, was in a car, from 20 miles away to the Liang Yun Cultural House.
Although these two years of discomfort, De Tinfu, 77 years old, was counting on "to come here in three times, a trick."
This is a small yard in the original state of Kuhara, unlike the general farm house, where the Qin cavity is often passed in the yard, and the wonderful leather film, embroidery, traditional Qin, the eyebrows, etc.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he started planning a cultural compound.
With the Liang Yun Cultural College, the village's cultural life has become rich and colorful.
The reporter hasn't walked into the Liang Yun Cultural College, and the Qin's tune has been passed.
He's singing the Qin Qin's selection for the village's village, Bresham.
She's a young man who loves Qin, and now she's famous in the area, and if she's free, she'll come to the Cultural House to perform the show for the folks.
Recently, Britham also played live on the Internet.
Britham said, "It's a happy thing to have more people to see themselves."
On stage, singers take a look at each other, players, even though amateurs, but they're not less passionate.
Like the simple style of the farm house, outside Qin, the "grass root" art and non-recovered culture in the Liang Yun Cultural College came.
The compound also contains over 300 pieces of farming equipment, traditional and handmade tiles, paper cutting, embroidery, skin shadows, etc. of different years.
Liang Yun led the press into the gallery in the yard, showing his old stuff, the old pot, the tristring, the roller, etc.
Why does a regular farmer build a cultural compound?
"The skin movie is my home handwriting, and I've been learning this technique since I was 15."
The Liang Yun Cultural Institute was established in 2012 as the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition" in Ningxia and a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in the city of Kuwon.
In addition to the Liang Yun Cultural College, the former state district of Kuwon City has emerged more than 120 cultural colleges, 79 civil performing groups, of which have more than 50 cultural colleges, such as the Shen Jia River Cultural College, Wang Yonghong Cultural College, Yangro Cultural College, etc., covering the towns and streets of the former state, with over 5,000 participants.
These grass-roots artists are active in the fields, enriches the cultural lives of the crowd and meet their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better, traditional culture cannot be just left behind. "
The Willow War is back again, "The Winning" to see the Yoo Yunlong Li Li Li's "Sunhua Network"
The 40th episode of the battle show "win" will land in Beijing on July 16th.
"The Winning" is adapted to the true history of the Soviet military file for years.
The famous actor Yoo Yunlong, who was known to the audience, challenged a very happy "sniffing agent".
In recent years, the red-red play like "The Mask" kite has proven that the type of war is a great life force.
Unlike the old war works, "win" looks at the world, extending the story background to the Soviet Far East.
It, in the context of the final phase of the 1944 War against Japan, tells the story of the Chinese Communist Party secret intelligence staff, Tang Fei, under the leadership of the Chinese underground party, the Secretary of the Province of Lin River and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In a lot of war shows, the lead man, as a senior spy, was a handsome, highly intelligent, mature image.
But in the view of Willow Yunlong, he's not fit to spy, "Spy should be the kind of man who can't find in a pile of people, and if it's a very handsome image, I hate everyone to look at you. Can you sneak up?" There's a line in the kite, "You don't come after me, I forget I'm a national party."
So in the Winning, Willow Yun-lone designed his master, Tang Fei as a happy "sniffing agent".
The other camp in "win" was carried out by the Japanese Fukuhara and Li Li Li Liang's police office.
Two South and North, two powerful theatres, adding a lot of good ideas to the whole play.
The director Yin Fei described the play of Li Li Li Li and Yoo Yunlong in the play, "It's definitely a drama, and they're both particularly close, and they're very powerful to me. Many times their plays are "showed," for example, we only write half pages of paper, and I don't stop when they shoot, and they can keep playing."
The masters don't play, directors don't mess with them, and when actors are in the role and guarantee their own character, they can not only shape roles from a character perspective, but also to give the audience more viewing possibilities, and Yin Fei is a great show.
In the play, there are many familiar faces in the Willows, and when the kite is known, the "F4" of the Great Wind, the "F4" of the Great Wind, and three were gathered in the "win."
He played Song Hyo-Ann and Zhao Jane's Huo-Yu and Liu Qianyang again, playing Tang Fei's right arm again.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "There is no bad root on these two people, but in that time, that environment is flowing through waves."
Willow Yunlong also offered, "We want someone to be in love. This man must have good and bad people around me, bad people are enemies, but we have to develop them, and our team will grow up."
The end of the two men in the show was carefully designed by Willow Yunlong, and he believed that he would give the audience a satisfactory response.

Xinhua Hong Kong, on July 25, Hong Kong, Director of the Financial Affairs and Treasury Department of the Hong Kong District, Xu Jung-woo, said that the financial market in Hong Kong remained active and operational.
He expressed optimism about financial stability and economy in Hong Kong.
Xu Jung-woo, a 24-day seminar organized by the Hong Kong Economic Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce (Daondo Time) said that Hong Kong experienced difficult situations because of the "renovation of the wind" and the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The Hong Kong dollar exchange price is stable and biased towards the level of the strong exchange guarantee.
The banking system has no clear signs of financial outflows, but rather, more than $11 billion since June.
The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase over the past few months, and the stock market has a series of public equity fund-raising activities, and market transactions have risen.
Xu Jung-woo said the new coronary pneumonia epidemic put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but the basic advantage of Hong Kong remained unchanged.
Hong Kong has many advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, the free flow of information and funds and simple low tax systems, making Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
Xu Jung-woo noted that the HK$6 billion in the District Government has set up HK$6 billion in the Anti-Eastion Fund, creating about 30,000 time-limited positions in public and private sectors over the next two years, covering different skills and educational people.

The "Lowha Sword" post commends China for its efforts to fight the disease and encourage countries to learn experience - the new network of China
According to the 25 Journal of Willow Leave, China, as a country with 1.4 billion people, similar to Europe or the United States, has been effectively controlled by the new coronary epidemic at this stage, without any further widespread transmission, which has largely controlled the epidemic in the country.
The article states that China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction over almost a decade, making China ' s preparations for the new crown much more than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The author says that at the time of SARS outbreak in 2002, China was not prepared at first, especially pathogens.
When the new coronary virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists soon were able to identify the type of the virus and shared genome sequence data with the international level on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical features of the virus and warned the world the threat of the new coronary virus through a research paper published in the Willow Sword.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, and in a state of emergency, through close cooperation in the country, such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly, and in May and July, the results of progress in the early testing of the new coronary vaccine developed by China in May and July, respectively.
China ' s experience has shown that it is important to invest in national health and research systems and effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for the rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health safety.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are worth learning and learning.
Moreover, China's experience has proven that, on a strong research basis, a strong, high-level, decisive decision-making, makes the new coronary epidemic effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that Governments and their leaders must respect science, understand the value of science and act on them in the most favourable way of society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, the Chinese National Defense Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risks and spread of the new coronary virus, and their recommendations provided the basis for the decision of Wuhan "Closed City" on January 23; when experts propose the necessity and urgency of building a square hospital, the Government quickly decided and quickly implemented; at the same time, the widespread participation of communities and the population also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
The article concluded that responding to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and respond together.

Barch Dracang post, and Yu Wang and a soldier are on duty.
In the average temperature of the year, a simple camp is standing at the hill entrance, and the camp is not far away, and the soldiers are on duty in the wind every day, while regularly patrol them at higher altitude.
The soldiers climb up the steep slopes, they need to use them.
In late July, it was when the low-altitude was so rich, and only in the ditch behind the camp was relatively dense green.
The warrior Gao Peng, who has been stationed at the post for six years, pointed at the ditch, and this is their back garden, and it's only in August that it can only see grass grow slowly, and soon after, it's all yellow and covered by snow.
Walking patrols, it could take about nine hours.
In the harsh highlands, the soldiers stationed here have been accompanied by snow mountains and glaciers, and they will regularly patrol them at higher altitude.
A patrol of eight fighters, led by the mentor Liang Yeo-chan, was on the patrol road again.
Each soldier weighs about 30 pounds, heading for the target early.
A soldier on the way, and the comrades are in emergency.
In addition to patrol missions, the soldiers at the Bartachon post are engaged in tactical and physical training every day.
It's a minute and a second, the altitude is rising, the oxygen content is getting lower and the strength is being overdrafted, and these factors test the will of the patrol.
They bite their teeth and then cross a few collapse points, and they're going to get a few more difficult beaches.
At 1600 hours, they took out their dry food, sitting at more than 5,700 metres above sea level, with rain and snow, to supplement their strength with food.

After a brief break in the cold wind, they climbed up the patrol target point, and took out the flag on the hill and solemnly sworn.
Behind the Mama Snow Mountain, they're dozens of kilometers ahead of them, and they're the safest guardians of the gate.
Beijing consumption season restarted - Xinhua Network
Beijing City restarts the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of "full restart, focus, orderly advance, tight organization".
1.5 million government consumer vouchers were issued on July 26, of which 1 million under-line catering coupons, 500,000 smart product vouchers, and consumers can receive them at the APP in Kyoto.
Liu Mei-young, Deputy Director of the Beijing Business Department, presented at the media gas conference held at 25 that the re-launched consumption season further reduced corporate funding based on maintaining the current consumer voucher card preferential subsidy.
Since early August, the current funding of government and enterprises has been adjusted to 1:1 to 2:1, for example, if the original consumer receives a card package to shop consumption, of which the government subsidy is $60 and the company's grant 60 dollars; the government subsidy is $80 after adjustment and $40 for the company.
During the consumption season, three operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promote new capital and 5G new consumption in Beijing.
Chen Mobo means that the Hong Kong economy has been hit again by the outbreak, calling for a difficult time in the community.
On July 26, Chen Mobo, Director of Finance Department of the Hong Kong District Government of Hong Kong, stated that Hong Kong had a positive impact on the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, which had been hit by a slight recovery and economic activity.
The District Government has once again called on owners of all sizes to reduce rent and to work with retailers, food and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Mobo published an article on the Internet entitled "The Way of Recovery."
He said that the recent number of confirmed new coronary pneumonia cases in Hong Kong was high, the situation was severe, affecting social life and the economy.
The first thing when the epidemic is repeated is to prevent the input of cases and to deal with and disrupt the chain of transmission at the fastest possible rate; when the epidemic is controlled, economic activity should be restored accordingly.
He noted that, in the face of the new wave of epidemics, it was a slight recovery business and economic activity that had also been hit.
For business, social responsibility is equally important beyond the spirit of contract, especially those who have received a large government subsidy in the Employment Insurance Scheme.
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation remained very serious in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to have slowed slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that the peripheral situation in Hong Kong is still critical.
Chen Mobo said that Hong Kong's development has shown that every crisis has hidden new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
A few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, I drove to work and found the city covered by fog.
I drive through there almost every day, but this time it's unusual, and I've never seen anything like that before.
Johannesburg is known for its unique beautiful antenna, but it was almost invisible that morning.
Soon I realized that I saw a serious fog caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment I knew in my old days and the skyline that was covered by the fog at this moment, was in my heart.
I'm afraid it's possible that the sunlight view that once changed will be devoured by the dark fog.
At that moment, I felt a strong impulse, trying to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is I can't just stand by and watch.
The biggest challenge is that I don't know environmental science, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm pretty sure I can't solve atmospheric pollution by code.
What will I do to solve this problem?
I'm just a city man.
In the next few years, I learned a very important lesson, and if we want to achieve a better future, we should remember this lesson.
Even if you're not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may have a way to solve that field problem.
Sometimes, the unique perspective you have can inspire irregular thinking so that the situation is left, but you need to try.
Only then can you know the results.
All I knew was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about the pollution, so I was back to a student.
I did some basic research, and soon learned that atmospheric pollution was the world's largest environmental health risk.
According to World Health Organization data, in 2012, almost 14 per cent of deaths worldwide were caused by atmospheric pollution from families and surroundings, especially in low- and middle-end income countries.
Atmospheric pollution causes higher mortality rates than malaria and AIDS every year.
In Africa, the premature death caused by unsafe health conditions, or the deaths caused by malnutrition of children, were pale in the face of atmospheric pollution, and it also brought huge economic costs: according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, expenditures in 2013 exceeded $400 billion.
In my work, I'm looking for the technological front of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, finding useful footing points and helping us make better decisions.
When I think about atmospheric pollution again, how to manage atmospheric pollution, things become clear, and we need to find better ways to make better decisions, considering the huge problem, and it's very necessary to work together.
So I decided to meet some people working in this field.
I started talking to officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I called people completely strange but related.
I've been working on these experiences that help me understand this more deeply.
And it helped me avoid the trap when people in my business try to innovate: to quickly adopt a technology before they really know the problem.
I started thinking, what can I do to improve this situation?
I started asking myself how to effectively integrate my knowledge skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the professional skills of the people I'm connected to.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends, to predict the results that may occur.
I'm sure my idea can be a realistic solution, but it's also facing uncertainty, and I can't guarantee it's going to succeed.
All I have is a specific set of engineers, the skills obtained from my work. ( laughter) Of course, for people who have been working in atmospheric pollution for years, my skills are brand-new.
I'm beginning to realize that sometimes a new perspective, a new combination of skills, can create something of excellence.
Our willpower and imagination are a light that shows us to cross the obstacles and open a new chapter.
I have learned more about atmospheric pollution, looking for atmospheric pollution data for the last decade, and the weather data on Johannesburg and the surroundings, and then I created air quality resolution support systems with colleagues from South Africa and China, and uploaded it to the clouds.
This software can analyze history and real-time data to reveal trends in pollution over time and space.
We then used new machine learning to predict future pollution a few days ahead of schedule.
It means that residents can make better decisions about their daily journeys and where their families are settled.
We can predict adverse pollution incidents in advance, define heavy sources of pollution, so that the authorities can order them to adjust their operations.
By supporting scenario planning, how to expand infrastructure, such as residential placement in industrial zones, urban planners can make better decisions.
We've built a first pilot of the technology, running 120 days, covering the whole South Africa.
The results of our expectations have been validated, and the projections and the data we collected in the field showed a close relevance.
Through our management, we introduced the world's leading cutting-edge instruments to predict atmospheric quality, and their resolution and correct rates were never seen before, so that the city I had to benefit from the near winter morning... and I said to myself, "Some things are wrong, I have to think of something. "
So the point is, what if I didn't study the problem of atmospheric pollution?
What if I don't care about the state's environmental situation, but hope in some places, and some other people are in charge of these things?
What I learned is that when we're doing everything we all believe in, it's important to focus on the possibility of success and considering the consequences of inaction.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, and it should inspire us to go further.
So whatever place you're in the world, next time, when you find some kind of curiosity that you're born to get up, and it's about what you care about, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if it's not your field of expertise, ask yourself, why not try?
Why don't you just come straight to solve the problem?
You might get an unexpected pleasure.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The largest earthquake in the eastern sea of Taiwan this year - the China New Network
On July 26th, China New York, the East Taiwan Sea, at 2052 hours, the earthquake of the 6.1th scale, the largest shock level 4, the entire earthquake, was the largest earthquake this year.
The media reports such as the Central Society, the Mid-Time Electronics, ETtoday News Clouds, the Taiwan Meteorological Department, the earthquake was located 86.5 km southeast of the Ilan County Government, the eastern Taiwan Sea, 53 km deep.
The Chinese earthquake station network has measured the earthquake at a level 5.5.
The largest shock in all over the station is: level 4, Ilan County, Taidong County, South Sing County, Yunlin County, and other counties measured levels of 1 to 2 levels.
According to the Taiwan Meteorological Department, the earthquake was the largest, hidden earthquake in the border of the plate since this year, and that there were earthquakes in the past and more active this year.
In the next week, there is still no aftershocks of a level of 4 or more.
Many people think driving is a thing that can only be seen.
Blind people want to drive a car alone, and it's considered an impossible mission until now.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we created a car designed for the freedom and independence of the blind.
Before I tell you about this blind car, let me briefly say another project I've ever done, called the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research and Planning, the City Challenge.
It's about making a mechanical car that can drive itself.
You press the start button and stop touching anything, and it can reach its destination completely automatically.
At the 2007 Challenge, our team won $500,000 to get third place in the game.
About that time, the National Blind Association, or the Blind Association, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would make blind people drive safely.
We thought we'd try, because we thought, "Hey, it's gonna be hard to go.
We've got an automatic car.
We just have to let the blind drive inside, so it's over, right?
But we're wrong.
The Blind League wants not a car that can carry the blind, but a car that blind can choose and handle it.
So we had to give up everything we used to start from scratch.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype of a small sand truck to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited many blind young people across the country and gave them a chance to use this car for a ride.
It's definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with this car is that it can only allow blind people to drive in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot -- even on a small road made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to make an important next step, creating a real car that could drive on the real road.
How does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complex system, but let me explain, to simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have sensory stages, computing stages and non-visual interfaces.
The pilot is clearly invisible, so the system must feel the surrounding environment and collect data for the pilot.
We use the initial metering element.
It measures acceleration, horn acceleration -- like a human ear, inner ear.
I combine this information with GPS to predict the location of the vehicle.
We also use two cameras to detect the path of the car.
We also use three laser rangers.
Laser scans the environment to detect barriers -- from front, back-to-back vehicles, and any obstacles on the road, any barrier around the vehicle.
All the big information goes on to the computer, and computers do two things.
First, one thing is to process information to understand the surrounding environment -- which is the path of the car, which is the barrier -- and transform it to the driver.
The system is also very intelligent to calculate the safest path of the car.
We can also give instructions on how to operate the vehicle.
But the question is: How can we transmit information and instructions fast enough to the blind to make sure he can drive?
To that end, we designed a lot of different non-visual user interfaces.
The original 3D flat sound system, vibrating vests, sound gears, leg belts, even pressured shoes.
But today we're talking about three of these non-visual user interfaces.
The first interface is called the handle.
It's a pair of gloves, and it has vibrating elements in the finger section, so you can transmit the instructions on how to drive -- direction and range.
Another device is called the speed band.
This chair -- actually, it's a massage chair.
We take it out, we're reorganizing the vibrating elements of different modes, and we let them transmit the speed information, and there's instructions on how to use the gas doors and brakes.
Here you can see how computers understand the surrounding environment, because you can't see the vibration, we actually have red light diodes on the pilot, so he can see what's happening.
It's sensory data, which is transmitted from sensors to the computer.
So these two devices, the handle and speed belts, are working.
But the problem is, these are instructions.
So it's not really freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, brake.
I call it a copilot problem.
So we're avoiding the instructions to hint the device, and focus more on the information device.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called empty maps.
Think of this as a blind monitor.
It's a small desktop, a lot of holes on it, compressed air excluded, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're blind, you put your hand on it, you can feel the route and the barrier.
Actually, you can change the frequency released in the air, and there's probably temperature.
It's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the left, the right camera and how the computer solves and transmits this information to the empty map.
That's it. We're showing a simulation program, a blind man driving with an empty map.
This program is very helpful to train blind drivers and quickly test different theories based on different non-visual user interfaces.
That's how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it's not going on unless it's proven to be as safe as a car today, or safer.
I'm sure this will happen.
But is society, can they accept this radical idea?
How will we deal with insurance?
How do we issue a driver's license?
There are many different obstacles behind the technological challenge that we need to solve it before they really become reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car driven by blind people.
But the potential is more important than that is the great value of the by-products in this project.
Sensors that can see darkness, rain fog.
And this new kind of interface, we can use these technologies to provide safer vehicles for visual populations.
Or for blind people, living daily household devices -- educational facilities, office facilities, office facilities.
Imagine, teachers write notes on the blackboard in class, and blind students can use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what teachers write.
It's extremely precious.
Today, what I show you is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Marinichev said that the change in value was affected by ruble devaluation and epidemic.
He said, "The cost of service is increasing.
People start spending more time on the Internet because of the epidemic ... "
Malinichev does not exclude a serious increase in Internet prices in the year, and believes that operators can provide higher speed and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with price increases.
Dr. China is planning to pay tribute to the hero of the disease.
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers against the plague hero, the chairman of the Bona Film Industry Group, director Liu Weiqiang (Tu left) interviewed the production of the film "China doctor" in Guangzhou.
The Bona Film Industry wants to pay tribute to all the medical care of the epidemic at the front line of the epidemic!
In 2021, the film will be a national exhibition to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.
At present, the Bona Film Industry is being deployed under the arrangements of the Ministry of China and the National Film Bureau, with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Province Film Bureau, organizing the film "China Airmaster" by the former Chinese team, a film reflected in the strong leadership of the party, the national people united against the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The film focuses on Wuhan's anti-disease line, which will be based on the background of Wuhan medical personnel and the provincial medical teams, using unique narratives, and a very powerful lens language, which shows the sensory story of Chinese medical personnel with dedication and sacrifice.
It is understood that at the first time of Wuhan's Day, Bona overcomes the difficulties and sent a team to the front line of the epidemic, and to communicate face-to-face with hundreds of medical workers, gathering information, and has now interviewed a large number of precious first-hand video messages, including the first member of Wuhan, the Guangdong Medical Team, the Wuhan Jin-Sing Hospital, Wuhan Union and Hospital, the Wuhan University Hospital, the Wuhan Central Hospital, the Wuhan Central Hospital, the Wuhan Center Hospital, and has taken a lot of valuable first-hand video information.
The Zhongnan Mountain also offered expectations and hopes for the film at this symposium: "I'm looking forward to not only visiting some more experts who have been exposed, but also more interviews with medical personnel who are in the front line, who are most of them. "
He said he'd seen "me and my country" "the captain of China" and that it was a good way to tell the big pattern story from a normal person's perspective.
"There are still some misunderstandings about China by some foreign friends. "
When it comes to the spread of the film, the Zhongnan Mountain Academy said that some people abroad like to label the virus on the politicized virus, and he hoped that the film could move the audience from a human perspective from a human perspective: "This film is better to be shown abroad, and to use a real human spirit to impress the audience in a way that the audience can understand at home and abroad. "
The Zhongnan Mountain also remembered the film "Man to Middle" in the 1980s, "So many years have passed, and I was the most impressed of the movie after reform and opening up, when my doctors abroad cried, and if the Chinese doctor could do that, it would be amazing."
The Chinese doctor can resonate with the audience abroad.
In the conversation, the Zhongnan Mountain also shared advice and advice on the current international epidemic, "I believe that people are always smarter than the virus."
According to the fact that, while the virus is unpredictable, humans have been in danger from the original society to date, and now there are developed medical science and technology and social management measures, combined with medical personnel around the world, and even the people of the world have a basic understanding of science in response to the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, and people will not be passive as before, "The next two areas are to look at how to strengthen cooperation around the world, and focus on comforting the hearts."

The Red Fruits, the first Red Bo meeting, today's news, the Hunan Daily News, the Chinese Voice Online.
Hunan Daily Xin Hunan client journalist Chiang Wie, correspondent Shaw Yan
The Ka Xing Red Ship Model, the Mao Zedong Copper Image, Yan Anbu, the Zenxi Yongsoon meat... on 25 July, the Red Tourism Culture Festival of 2020 was opened in the mountains.
As one of the main events, the first Red Cultural Industry Fair was held at the Global Tourism Advisory Centre in Xuanshan.
The exhibition area's red-style products, the old revolutionary district, the Tout products, are all over the place, leading tourists to buy it.
" This Red Fair is both a national demonstration of the results of the red culture industry and an important platform for the exchange of experiences between exhibitors and businesses to explore development paths ... "
The head of the first Red Fair Executive Committee introduced the Red Fair, which, on the theme "Advanced Red Culture for the Warming of the Red Culture" with a total area of nearly 3,000 square metres, with an atmosphere-building area, and a view area showing the Chen and the Red Man Brigade network network.
Zhejiang Ka Xing, Guizhou, eight foreign provinces, and 137 enterprises in Changsha, Jizhou, Yuyang, Zhongzhou, etc., to exhibit 768 exhibits, including red artifacts, crafts, food specialty, tourism routes, red training courses, red creative products, etc.
The exhibition area will be displayed until July 29th.
As host of the Red Fair, the show area is bright.
The director of the exhibition area introduced that the show was divided into the red industry, and the red cultural industry was developed in two parts.
The red industrial exhibition area displays 31 exhibits of six enterprises such as the Walling Steel, Walling Wire, Power Power, and the Red Cultural Industry Development Area displays the red series of books, red series of foods, red series of products, red series of creative products, etc.
In the Yanan exhibition area, a lot of tourists were attracted to the display of fabric and paper cutting art.
The director of the Yanan City Hotel, Matonpo, introduced the exhibition carefully selected the excellent red-based product of Yanan for almost two years, 16 of which were excellent in the country's red creation.
At the same time, they invited the National Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection Project, Anse Paper Cuts, the "Shot North People's Song" and the provincial non-recover project, Yonkawabu, focusing on the introduction of Yenan Folklore products and to communicate with other exhibition units to promote cross-regional cooperation.
The cumulative number of new coronary confirmed cases in Japan is over 30,000 cases - Xinhua Network
According to statistics, 239 new confirmed cases were reported in Tokyo on 26 days, with more than 200 new cases on a single day for six consecutive days, with a cumulative number of 11214.
In addition, 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka, 90 new cases in Fukuoka County and 80 new cases in Aichi County.
Telecommunications cyber fraud crime increased by 70% in the first half of the year - the top review feature - China New Network
According to the Supreme Inspection website, in the first half of this year, the national prosecution authorities sued 58101 fraud crimes, an increase of 35% over the same period.
In particular, fraud is high in crime against the epidemic, and the prosecution authorities prosecute 43.4 per cent of the total number of fraud offences against the epidemic.
The Supreme People ' s Procuratorate has conducted targeted guidance and has now issued nine of the 10 typical cases of epidemic prevention and control.
From the case of the prosecution authorities in the first half of the year, the number of names involving fraud, up to the national macro-policy, the lower to the population's clothing and food, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care" fraud, "induction brokering" fraud, "drive country subsidy fraud, national assets defrozen fraud, etc., which are constantly "inducing new" areas, covering education, medical care, employment, social security, land demolition, precision poverty alleviation, financial credit, but also seriously affecting economic social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network fraud has broken national boundaries, geographical and human restrictions, with popular, cross-border, remote, electronic payments, and are many and dangerous groups that are not specific.
For example, there are specialized companies, rent high-end writing buildings, establishment of multiple departments or jobs, using legitimate web platforms to promote, recruit, train and appraisal of recruiters, manage business models, with "legal coats" and more confusing.
The timely warning to the public and related authorities is the duty of the prosecution authorities to punish and prevent crime in accordance with the law.
In the judicial case, the prosecution authorities are seriously performing their duties, insists on maintaining high pressure on fraud crimes and targetedly detailed law enforcement initiatives, promoting social governance through the issuance of prosecution recommendations.
The prosecution authorities have strictly closed the arrest, prosecution of fraud, evidence, procedural and legal application, based on facts, law-based, and is not innocent.
In particular, for telecommunications network fraud, focuses on the central role of electronic data in factual identification and efforts to build electronic data, evidence, evidence, evidence between documents.
If the Public Prosecutor ' s Department of the District of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, was involved in the first time, from the case to the completion of the case, and only five days, reflecting the attitude and determination of maintaining the stability of the society.
In the review of the arrest and review of prosecution sessions, focus on the prosecution of cases, correcting the leakage of 733 public security organs and correcting the disappearance of 1113 co-authors by public security organs.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecution Service issued 298 proposals for fraud crimes to promote joint protection against fraud and promote deep governance.
For example, in response to loopholes found in communications enterprises, banks, intermediaries, etc. in the supervision of telecommunications networks, the Guangzhou City Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Guangdong Province, and the East Chang City Public Prosecutor ' s Office, urged the relevant units to strengthen regulation, improve mechanisms and help build a system of efficiency.
Four is to do your best to recover the damage.
The various prosecution authorities seized important elements such as intervention in the investigation of evidence, reviewing prosecutions, and urged the investigative authorities to actively pursue stolen money, and work to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud to the people ' s population.
If a case of a loan from Lin, which was processed by the Beijing Public Prosecutor ' s Public Prosecutor ' s Office, involved 22 houses of production and the first "suspensation enforcement letter" was issued in a timely manner, recommended that the Court had previously seized the court to suspend the property involved, pending the identification of the crime, and to make the greatest effort to recover the property involved and to restore the victim's losses.
The prosecutor reminds you that you are very vigilant about fraud crimes, don't count on the sky's pie, or don't think it's cheap, keep your money bag.
Weining County, Guizhou: Short apple trees, wide-out of poverty - China New Net

Summer inflammation, Economic Journal - Chinese Economic Network journalist entered the village of the town of Jina, Weining County, Guizhou.
With the sun, the villagers Lee Won-chung were grass in the base, and though it was red, but he sang a few songs from time to time.
Weining County, located in the town of Yuna, with low latitude, high altitude, light, high day and night temperature, high sugar, good taste, and a certain visibility in the surrounding area, but because of the small head, with a lot of spots, has never been able to sell a good price, and no industrial size.
The town of Juna was a poor town of "Cau Valley Potato Springs" with a incidence of 25.8% in poverty 10 years ago.
In the critical period of the battle against poverty, changing traditional planting habits, adjusting industrial structures and increasing farmers ' income.
After a number of visits, Chen Hyo-chul, the Secretary of the Party of the town, believes that industry can't go any longer.
To that end, the town of Yuna introduced the lead company to grow apples in a modern way.
Weining went beyond the Deputy Managing Director of Agriculture Ltd., Hu Jianwen, from Shaanxi to the town of Xinna in 2015, looking at the local conditions of cultivation, starting in 2016 to plant apple trees locally.
At first, the village mobilized Lee Won-chung to plant the land and planted apple trees, and the Lee Won-chung and the two of them made a grunt: "I've grown apples for years, and they don't see anyone in the village grow apples."
"All apples are short apples, and they don't grow too high."
What I didn't think of is that this apple cultivation has adopted a new method, irrigation pipes are laid under every apple tree, water and fertilizers are pouring into the roots, and when the fruit is collected in the fall, the tractors go into the orchard, and stand there to pick fruit.
At present, Apple Base has gradually entered the production period, and the market, as Ho Jianwen expected, apples are not sad and popular with urban consumers like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou.
The growing apple industry has made Lee Won-zhong's life new, and although it's still growing, has a new source of income.
The Lee Won-chung family has a nine-acre land flow to Apple Base, and every year, there's a profit after the bottom of the land flow, and the couple usually works at the base, "80 dollars a day for one person and work for the year."
Li Won-chung told reporters that last year's profits were divided into 2,800, plus land flow fees and the income of the couple, one with a variety of 80,000 income, "I'm not sad, and Kang's days have passed."
"It is now beginning to be effective, with an annual value of over 15,000 acre of apples, about 10 times the corn. "
Chen Chu told reporters that 20,000 acres of apples were currently planted in the town, 6,000 acres alone in the village of China Sea, covering 4056 households, 172 million, of which covered 656 poor households, 2952 people, paid more than $6 million a year, and that the base was built at the home door without leaving.
Li Won-zhong, who is growing up, has begun to realize his wish.
This year, Li Won-chung bought a Land Cruiser, and now we're driving cars to work every day, "There are a dozen acres of land at home, and when the next apple base expands, and they're all going to be more paid."

The membrane separation technology helps to break the greenhouse effect.
The membrane separation technology helps to break the greenhouse effect.
New hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology diagram
This newspaper, journalist, reported that the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy team of Tianjin University made significant progress in the collection of carbon dioxide in the membrane separation method, successfully developed new hybrid base membrane preparation techniques to significantly improve the CO2 capture performance of membrane materials.
The results have been published as a cover article on the international journal Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
The greenhouse effect is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and CO2 emissions are the cause of greenhouse effects.
How to capture and use human emissions efficiently is the focus of scientists' concerns.
The membrane separation method is an emerging CO2 capture technology that separates CO2 gases with the help of membrane materials, with efficient energy conservation and simple operational characteristics.
How to get the membrane material "breath" to improve the efficiency of gas separation is the difficulty of collecting carbon dioxide using membrane separation.
The research team of Tianjin University has innovative ideas to explore the effects of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
The results of the experiment show that the carbon nanopipe distribution in membrane materials is more evenly distributed in the membrane material, which effectively increases the performance and rate of gas separation of membrane materials.
Mixed matrix film prepared with this new technology, CO2 separation is close to the theoretical separation ceiling of such membrane materials.
" New technologies provide new ideas for the collection of carbon dioxide by membrane separation ... "
Li Yun, member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team at Tianjin University, said: " We hope that this technology will provide strong support for future coal-fired coal-fired plants and chemical enterprises to take a significant role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions. "
Before you volunteer to fill out the paper, you know what's a professional difference.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning by Yu Xiao, Responsible Editor: Yu Xiao
Before you volunteer to fill out the paper, you know what's a professional difference.
Every year, students or parents have students or parents who are not aware of the terms involved in the voluntary filling, and thus affects voluntary filling.
This year, Beijing University of Transport, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing Chemical University, 5 higher education universities jointly launched the 2020 admission policy to eliminate professional differentials.
What does the professional difference mean, what is the importance of voluntary filling in the paper?
There are three ways of professional distribution rules.
Experts remind us that before volunteering, it is important to read the "enrolment charter" of the Heart School, and to learn about the admission rules of higher education, including the transfer ratio, the professional distribution rules, etc.
Professional distribution rules, which mean that after higher education, there are mainly professional priorities, priority scores and three ways of professional level differentials.
Which method is specifically used by the college will be made clear in the admission charter.
But there are also the principles of admission to higher education institutions, with no grade difference between professions.
So, when the score is not reached the first professional voluntary entry line, the second professional volunteer entry line is reached, so push until the last professional volunteer volunteer is accepted, and there is no grade difference between professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional difference" is one or more points published in the admissions in the admission of different professional volunteer candidates, which is "professional difference".
That is the score difference between the College in the first professional and non-first-professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 points, etc.
For example.
Assuming that the student's A High School, 560 points, the professional volunteer was: computers, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, professional admissions to A higher education, with a difference of 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
In the course of professional distribution, if Ming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and has a planned balance, then Ming is admitted to the "computer" profession; if computers are not admitted, his scores will be reduced by two points, and the first professional voluntary examination "international trade" candidates, determine whether professional admission conditions are met; if the score is not met, the score is reduced by 1 (i.e. 557) for third professional volunteer "automating" admission; if the score is still not met, the score will be reduced by the fourth profession, and if it is not met, the subsequent profession will not meet its professional volunteer, and will no longer be reduced.
Different university professional levels are different.
With the spread of parallel volunteering, many higher education institutions have now cancelled the professional level, but some higher education institutions still retain this method this year, and in the terms of the "enrolment charter" published by the schools, more than 20 universities have set up professional differences this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Technology, Jiangxi Teacher Training University, Chengdu School of Medicine, North-East Electricity University, China University of Technology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Industrial University, Ningxia University, Shandong Polytechnic University, China Civil Aviation Flight College, etc.
In these colleges, the professional difference in each university is different.
Some higher education institutions have grades in each profession, such as Ningxia University, which have been put in the school's candidates, and they are admitted in the order of professional volunteering by one point in order of the candidates.
And some universities have different professional differences between different professions.
For example, the total score of the professional volunteer grade is 4 points, i.e. the first professional volunteer is three points, and other professional volunteers are not graded between other professional volunteers, considered parallel volunteering, and other professional volunteers and other professional volunteers are 1 point.
When you report to volunteer, the candidates and parents must read the admission policy of the schools reported, see if there is a professional difference, and in the form of the difference, while taking into full consideration of the scores, a reasonable analysis of the selected schools and professions, and if the institution clearly takes a grade difference in the enrolment charter, the candidates should be careful with the gradients between the professions and increase the admissions.
