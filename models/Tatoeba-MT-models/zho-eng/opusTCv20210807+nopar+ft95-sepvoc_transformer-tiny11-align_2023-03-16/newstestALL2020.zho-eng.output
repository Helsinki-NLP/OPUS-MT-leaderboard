The women's platoon is expected to defend the World Cup early!
On 27th, in the Dutch women's platoon, the Chinese team was taken back to a city with two games in a row, and eventually at 3:1 Rick Holland, and won nine in a row.
The World Cup is nearing its end, and despite the hope, the Chinese women's platoon is still in the face of the Serbian team.
The first two games with the Netherlands, the Chinese women's platoons were as strong as 25:19, 25:16, two cities, until the third round, and the team had a setback.
Dutch women ' s platoons have strengthened the offensive of the ball in the backwards, and the Chinese team was hit, and the girls were attacked, and the mistakes began to increase, and eventually took back to a city at 21:25 by the opponent.
In an interview with the race, Rongping also said: " The third round, because we sent about eight points. "
Of course, Dutch women's platoons are not small, and the Chinese women are ready to play before the Chinese women's platoon, but it's still in the hands of Rongping, " and the strong team is normal, and it's normal to play five games, so we say focus, "Rongping says.
In the fourth round, the team is actively adjusting, and Zhang Chang Ning is open at the attack, gets eight points in a single game, and it's a big job for the team.
So far, the 11 rounds of confrontation have left two rounds, and the Chinese women's platoon, although one hand has touched the championship trophy, it did ring the Chinese women in the Dutch race: the more the critical moment, the more you do.
In another 27th race, Russia and American women were full of five games, and the American team failed to take three points from his opponent, so that the Chinese women were able to achieve a round of defense if they took three points in Serbia.
The situation is moving towards the Chinese women's platoon.
However, while the Serbian team is already short of all, this does not mean they will easily give them three points to the Chinese team.
In the form of the current score list, the Serbian team is largely unproclaimed, which means they can "lightly up" in the Chinese women's platoon, put down the burden to hit the opponent, and the Chinese team is under the pressure to win the crown, but they may have a rise and fall.
Moreover, the replacement Serbian team is not a lamb of the "killing" who had been in the service of the Dutch team, where the two sides fought the 5th round, and Serbia II finally turned the Dutch main formation at 3:2 and thus the depth of its formation.
Before the third stage of the game, Rongping also said that the two teams were in a bad position: " Osaka's game will be very difficult, and we must be prepared as always. "
Now the horn of the coronation has been blown, and the game is really in the "white heat phase."
The Chinese women's platoons are on the front of their opponents, but at the last critical point, and see if the girls are able to play normal levels and release themselves on the field.

Most of the 100 disabled people who participated in the event were on the cruise ship for the first time.
Zhao Jingang, 56, was a cripple, who was rarely out because of the inconvenience to move.
He said, " For the first time today, we're on a cruise ship, enjoying the vastness of the river, feeling the pulse of the long sand, and it's very exciting and unforgettable. "

However, if heroes walk around, they seem to be as ordinary as you are.
Yuan Longping, the study of the deep rice, has raised the world, making hundreds of millions of people from hunger, and it's like an old farmer who likes to walk in the field; Nan Indong, the chief scientist who has made China's "The Eye" angry, one man, a pot, a pot, a whole life, eating cold buns in Guizhou, and the old man in the castle; Zhou Chang, a red scientist, a late village boy who is still like to be a young man, and a young man in the middle of the world, and he's been in the middle of the world, and he's got a white hair in the middle of the world, saying that learning to ask the heart, and he likes to laugh;
They, like, be kind, live simple and stubborn, and they're just in the business of the outsiders, and they're easy to live without being known, and they don't care about the famous, rich and proud.
Like the golden novel, Shaolin Temple hides the temple of the temple, who is in a state of shock, and no joy.
Every "sweeping monk," every red son has a family behind me.
Home, not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hands of millions of people.
Once, a girl high school student said, "When heroes pass by, someone has to sit by the road and applaud... and I don't want to be a hero, and I want to be a man sitting on the side of the road."
Actually, when heroes and heroes applaud, it's not a contradiction.
The people who applaud the roadside are also sending heat and light, and they're glowing.
As you are like me, there are always opportunities in your life, and there's a moment, a long day and a hero.
Shanghai's outstanding judge Zou Beihua, who took over justice reform, but at the annual meeting, told his story at the annual meeting, and sent countless newspapers a year, and "Do the simple thing is not easy." The judges will give a round of applause to the old harvest of the "Sweep Monk".
It's a hero's relationship, a hero applauds another hero.
The monks have Shaolin Temple, Yuan Longping has a vast rice field, and Nan Indong has a stage, and you have a stage, and you can be a hero, not work alone, better environment and positive incentives.
Like the Chinese Eye, and now it looks like a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese science and technology community was still climbing hard, and novelist Liu Tsu Xin had not yet opened the "three."
The best eye at that time, was the single-sided caliber radio telescope in the Puerto Rican Valley -- Aresibo, 350 meters in diameter, considered the most "not beyond" world.
The Chinese radio telescope was less than one tenth in diameter.
And Nan Indong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries, insisted on returning back to a near-crazy idea: building a new generation of radio "Big Telescope" in China, receiving more messages from outer space!
China is a great investment for stars?
The country trusts Nan Indong, the sky-eyed project is a huge opening.
It took 12 years to select the site, and the project was set up and nine years.
500 meters of the sky eye opened, and China has made a precedent, "the world's unique scientific engineering."
So, "The Eye of Heaven" is amazing, the South Indongs are great, big, high-profile republics are great.
With the trust of the nation, the kindness of the nation, the South Indong side has a chance to be the spirit of the nation.
A young man, a white-haired hero walks through, and people applaud the road, and a country like this is beautiful and harmonious.
The garbage classification education first entered the Jilin kindergarten, and the environmental concept started with the doll.
On 27th, a kindergarten in Jilin, Jilin Province, conducted a garbage classification course to teach young children to identify recycled waste and other types of garbage.
According to the information received, this is the first time that the garbage classification has entered the local early childhood education class.
A few days ago, the nine departments of Jilin Province jointly launched the " Work Programme for the Processing of Land-level Urban Waste Classification of Wastes in Jilin Province " .
Based on the pilot classification of compulsory waste in Changchun City in 2019, the province decided to classify life waste in local cities.
Gillin is one of them.
We want to promote environmental ideas through this event to bring families, kindergartens to promote environmental ideas.
The director of the International Kindergarten, Liu Lijun, who was held at the event, said.
That day, the gardener read the environmental initiative, hoping that the garbage classification started with the children.
After the "low-carbon bee" dance, they're going to group up a little junk-class game.
The mentor also issued the "recoverable" "other garbage" label, suggesting that the kids stick the label to the trash can and record a little video.
Liu Lijun introduced the kindergarten to promote low-carbon, green and environmental concepts and regularly open environmental halls.
The garbage dump in the park also set up a classified trash can, marked the drop category.
Teacher teaches the kids what's recycled garbage, geese, camera.
According to preliminary statistics, urban waste generation in 2018 in Jilin province was about 54,52 million tons, all into the disposal of living waste disposal sites.
Of these, 32929 million tons of sanitary landfills, burned 209.23 million tons, with an integrated use process of processing of 801 million tons.
After years of effort, the provinces and municipalities have the capacity to treat waste.

Sherac died. The political heritage is long.
On 26 local time, former French President Chirac died, 86 years old.
At the moment where the world is in a hundred years of unprecedented change, the many political heritage left behind when he was in power is still worthy of our praise.
Sherac was a French president for 12 years in a very personal way.
He inherited the spirit of the independence of the De Gaulleism and strong support for European integration, a representative who chases the European Dream.
At the same time, he has been a strong advocate of multipolarization and multilateralism in the world, a strategic politician.
That's why the French media evaluates him as "the distinguished representative of France on the world stage."
One of the political decisions of Chirac is against the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined Germany to hold the pressure of the United States and walked in front of the war.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to the increase in terrorist activity and make the world more dangerous.
Later, it turns out that Chirac's warning was correct.
In Europe's integration, the American unilateralism is becoming more visible, and the past, is certainly a great inspiration for strategic thinking and choices for international politics and global affairs.
Sherac is also a French politician who makes Chinese familiar and kind.
He was one of the advocates and creators of the Golden Decade of Chinese-French relations, and after the first election of President of France in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Chinese-French relations with the strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, the Central Law established a comprehensive strategic partnership, with bilateral Chinese-French engagements entering a new phase.
During the Hirac administration, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, with breakthrough progress in cooperation between the two countries in various areas of aviation, nuclear energy, rail transport.
The year of Chinese-French culture of the Hirac Initiative created a new model of cultural exchange in the history of Chinese law.
The love of Chirac's life towards Chinese culture is particularly impressive.
He's known to introduce his Chinese diplomat that Chirac can carry some of the poems of Lee Bai, Duft, and even accurately judge the history of the Chinese copper.
"It's not really Egypt, not really in Egypt, not really in China." – this golden sentence comes from Sherac.
In an interview with Xinhua journalist, Chirac said: " The West has concerns about China's political and social development, ecological problems arising from China ' s economic growth and the political status of China at the international level ...
But I have faith in China.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help them build ideas and values for harmonious development and to take responsibility on the world stage for a long time ... "
I also believe that the revival of China will bring new creativity to world culture and enrich the world culture.
The Sze has gone, but the political heritage and revelations left to the world will live with the world.

The Hong Kong District Legislative Council is co-sponsored by the United States of America-related Act.
Some formed members of the Hong Kong District Legislative Council issued a joint statement on 27th to the adoption of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019.
This statement, by a joint 40 formed parliamentarians, stated that Hong Kong ' s current rights are granted by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including maintaining free trade ports and separate customs zones, signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements in different areas such as economic, financial, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sports, in the name of "Hong Kong, China" and to engage in different countries and territories around the world.
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature ...
Hong Kong has been strictly committed to international agreements, international rules, legal and business ethics, and has been involved in cooperation in a wide range of relevant areas, and has been very visible.
The statement states that the United States Senate Foreign Committee has not been necessary to adopt the relevant bill, but to respond to the call of its bad port agent as a means of rough intervention in Hong Kong's internal affairs and seeking political chips for its agents in Hong Kong.
The formed congressman deeply regrets that the United States will be strongly opposed to this.
The statement states that Hong Kong is a major trading partner and the largest source of trade surplus in the United States.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, a clean society, makes it a good location for American businessmen.
If the United States passed this bill, in addition to combating the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, will make relations between China and the United States without any benefit and undermine themselves.
The statement states that Hong Kong will, as always, to implement the "one State, two systems" approach, continue to enjoy the rights granted by the basic law and to effectively fulfil its obligations.
Hong Kong will continue to contribute to the international community and international trade, whether in the past or in the future.
According to the European Times, the two houses of the French Parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
French President Marlon recently claimed that France could not "take everyone" but also try to "take it properly."
Reports say that Marlon tried to find a compromise on immigration to slow the impact of the upcoming debate.
Recently, Marlon was interviewed during the general debate of the General Assembly in New York, the United States expressed the hope that there was a real "two-pronged" programme in immigration policy to find a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
Marklon said: " If France wants to be properly admitted (immigrant), it cannot accept all " .
Marklon lists four priorities of immigration policy: grant asylum qualifications to refugees in need of protection; more efficient promotion of immigration integration; reception and protection of all immigrants entering French territory; more efficient resettlement of persons who are not suitable for illegal access to France.
Whether illegal migrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance System (AME) system, the most discussed topic in all previous sectors.
Marklon said he wanted to be able to "evaluate" the system, but did not cancel it, but rather to limit it.
After Marlon made this statement, Le Peng, the leader of the extreme right-wing National Union, stated that Marlon's statement was "empty."
Right-wing Republicans, Senate Speaker Russell, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "defeating" but "to face reality" and indirectly criticized Marklon.
The left Socialist Congressman Valu believes that on immigration, France should "admit more, better" and criticized Marlon for the issue of "fucking."
The report states that the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act has been enacted for a year, leading to differences in the ruling party's internal opinion, but it is not able to calm the right opposition party.
In the next 2022 general election, the topic of immigration policy will again become the focus of the extreme right-wing attack, and Marlon needs to make a difference in this issue, but it will also provoke the risk of left-wing people within the ruling party.

There are signs that China's A stock is on the "repurchase tide," and many listed companies have taken out the real silver and silver repurchase company stock.
According to the financial data service provider Eastern wealth, as of 27 days, the total amount of A stock listed companies had been repurchased over 100 billion yuan (renminbi, same), far beyond the same period of previous years, creating a new high in the amount of A stock buyback.
In response, Xu Yang, Chairman of the Shanghai MacKing Information Consulting Limited, stated that the overall valuation of the A stock market this year, repurchased shares at relatively low prices, which would facilitate the efficiency of the use of funds by listed companies and reflected the willingness of listed companies to manage market value and a strong cash flow, which would facilitate the boost of investor confidence.
In addition, a well-developed system of repurchase of shares has also contributed to the active repurchase of shares by listed companies.
For example, early this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued rules for the implementation of the repurchase of shares by listed companies, providing detailed stock repurchase norms and guidelines for listed companies.
According to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented additional repurchase schemes have been concentrated in capital industries, real estate, information technology and electronic equipment manufacturing.
In addition, from the amount paid back, six listed companies returned over $1 billion this year.
Of which, the first one was the Ely shares, with a return of over $5 billion.
What would be the impact of the market for repurchased stocks by listed companies?
In an interview with the Chinese People ' s University School of Finance and Finance, Zhao Sijun, in an interview with Chinese Xin Xin, said that the repurchase had a strong economic power and a better financial situation, with the ability to maintain stock prices and confidence in investors; on the other hand, that listed companies and their shareholders were responsible for companies, responsible for markets and responsible for investors.
The former is based on good business performance of the company, which requires listed companies and their holding shareholders to be of higher quality.
For capital markets, this is the core of the foundation.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies helps to boost investor confidence and support the price of the stock prices of listed companies.
According to the Eastern Securities Research Survey, according to the projected number of stock repurchases set by A stock listed companies since the beginning of this year, and the average price of the repurchased stock is expected to exceed $150 billion in the A stock market this year.

To protect, save Mom's ancestors' murals, the ancient Cultural Street Management Committee and the Queen's Palace in Tianjin City launched the restoration of the temple and the interior of the temple.
The restoration project was led by Cai Chang-kyu and invited four famous national painters to participate.
The restoration was based on the principle of "old as old" and made local adjustments to the original murals, which were repaired in places where murals were originally not perfect.
We've also made innovations and attempts in color, materials, pen ink, etc.
After repair, the original mural was maintained, spiritual, spiritual and artistic style.
The Queen's Palace was built in 1326, formerly known as the Palace of the Princess, commonly known as the Mother's Palace, and has been re-established, the oldest complex in Tianjin City and one of China's first mothers' temples in the present age.

Secretary Wang Bo-sang, Secretary of the Shandong County Council, the Rich People's Heart, Xinhua Network
Wang Bo-sang, Shandong Su-gwang, born in February 1943, worked in 1967 and served as Secretary of the Party of the Town Party, county secretary, mayor, etc.
In 1986, Wang Bae-sang was Secretary of the Shugwang County, Shandong Province, when the life was a poor county in the Yujong factory.
In five years of life light, Wang's heart was a man's heart, focusing on three things: to advance the industrialization of vegetables; and the development of the Sino-North salt beach; and three were the foundation for industry to turn over and put the life-lighters up their pockets and stood up their waistboards.
Lifelight farmers have a tradition of vegetables and a lesson of seeding.
In the early 1980s, life-light farmers couldn't sell food and rot in the ground.
Wang's research has found that the key to catching vegetables is to make the flow.
Lifelight first built a wholesale market for vegetables and opened the market economy.
Party cadres are taking the lead, screwed up, all the lost county.
In 1989, with Wang Bo-sang's support, 17 party members like Wang Lui, San Yuan village, made 17 winter warm vegetable sheds, and 17 "Ten million families" in the village.
The county then established a outreach team, with Wang Bo-sang's mobilization, Wang Lu Yi visited the towns; more than 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted in the first year, and then the vegetable sheds were pushed to the whole county and the country.
For centuries, 1.6 million acres of land in the north are shallow beaches except salt-alkali Beach.
The local crowd lives very hard.
Su Nam has a vegetable shed. What about Subei?
Wang Bo-sang organized a war for hundreds of thousands of people to camp on the beach, and it's 45 days.
Wang Bo-sang and the chief cadres in the county are on the site, pushing cars like civilian workers, and the people see them all stretch their thumbs, and admire them... when Subei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and the "poly pot" on the salt base.
In July 1986, Wang Bo-sang participated in the first time as the county secretary.
During the meeting, a "Symmetrical comparison of industrial economy in the city of the city of Xianjong City" was sent, and it was a good industrial product, and it was a good life light, and it was ranked fourth.
But if you take off the original salt, the pure industrial value of the life light is only $119 million, and the third in the countdown.
Wang Bo-sang ran to the field with over 70 people in the field.
In less than a year, the county invested $150 million and 77 projects.
Every year since then, we've been organizing a "screw" to Shenzhen, Dong-ho and Shanghai.
Lifeless businesses, less entrepreneurs.
Wang Bo-sang hosted the panel of the panel: the public selection of the manager of the factory throughout the county, 40 "the capable of a career" emerged and pushed to the industry line.
In 1991, lifelight entered the 100-Power county of the country, and Wang Bae-sang was appointed Deputy Mayor of the city of Xianjong.
He left over 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4854 businesses, over 100,000 "millions of households" and are recognized cadres.
On 26 September, local time, the State and Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired the Foreign Ministers of China and the Council of African Member States at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The current member of the Council of Africa, Tano, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Equatorial Guinea, Oyono, Minister of Foreign Affairs of South Africa, Pandor, Minister of Foreign Affairs of South Africa, Kara, Foreign Minister of Niger, was attended by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Tunisia.
Wang Yi made four recommendations on strengthening the cooperation between the Central African parties in the Council.
First, to unite.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, which is the challenge of the basic norms of international relations, and the role of the United Nations has been hit and undermine the interests of a wide range of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
Addressing this challenge requires medium-handed hand-to-hand hands, side by side, solidarity.
In the Council, the three African countries speak with a voice, and the focus is not just three votes, but the entire continent.
China and Africa stand together, not just four votes, but also lead other countries to follow-up, influence and shape the Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with Council members in Africa to fully use this coordination mechanism.
Second, the dispute is negotiated.
China has been advocating political solutions to hotspots, and Africa has a good tradition of consultation and experience in successful good offices of African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex challenges on the Council ' s agenda, particularly African hotspots, are mostly the causes of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We need to use chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations to play the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation, etc.
Third, to be self-sufficient.
African countries and people know the problems of Africa, and Africa has the ability to solve their problems with wisdom.
In addressing African hotspots, the Council should focus on listening and respect for Africa ' s will and should play the role of regional and subregional organizations and should encourage and support in-life solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with the Parties and firmly advance capacity-building for African autonomous peace operations.
Fourth, the foundation of development.
China and the vast number of African countries are developing countries, and we must insist on putting economic and social development first and mutually supportive of their respective choices.
China is willing to build the "Away to the AU Agenda 2063 " , the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, and Africa ' s development strategies are closely aligned to help African countries strengthen their development capacity and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We need to jointly promote the United Nations ' s investment in Africa's development.
The Ebola outbreak has been re-emerged, and China has been fully supportive, providing energy, and will be willing to coordinate action with African countries to mobilize assistance to increase assistance such as the United Nations, WHO, and to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Congo.

Trudo's "man's collapse." Can he be re-elected?
This time, I tripped Trudo out of the big pit, and Trudo himself dug up a little bit.
Recently, Canadian media have exposed an old picture of the current Prime Minister Trudo, who dressed himself as a black image.
This is considered a clear act of racial discrimination that triggered a huge wave in Canada.
Trudo apologized to the public after it happened.
However, the Canadian people don't buy much.
Trudo was a rock that hit his feet.
As political commentators Riley et al. pointed out, since the "anti-black-face movement" started in the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party have been high-profile accusing opposition or dissidents of the opposition or the Party of the Party of the Party of the "Big Festival" and repeatedly threatened that "who makes this mistake should be immediately fired."
In short, this time you tripped Trudo out of the big pit, Trudo himself dug up a little bit.
Trudo was the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudo, young and handsome, who had just left the "political idol" cyclone.
He was originally a political vegetarian, who took over as the head of the Federal Liberal Party, he fought an unexpected and beautiful war in the 2015 Canadian Federal Legislative Elections – the Federal Liberal Party was held in the lower house of the Federation, and gained valuable separate group rights.
At that time, Trudo has proposed many deaf political platforms, such as " ethnic and gender equality " " " Eco-environmental " economic revitalization " , emphasizing the elimination of corruption and the "ungood wind".
However, for five years in power, he has been in the end of almost all the above, " high-level " .
In the case of ethnic and gender equality, he left the Black Face incident, before he "unbelievably unbelievably" on a series of indigenous people's issues, which moved the protest tent to the entrance to Congress Hills on the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada.
In the end of last year, Trudo was involved in the boiling "Lanwanling incident" at the beginning of last year.
He was exposed to a major violation of the private fraud case of the construction engineering company Lanwanling, who was responsible for investigating the department and officials, asking the latter to "highen your hands."
Moreover, Trudo has been angry with officials who have been angry with the disclosure of the fraud – Wang Citi, mentioned earlier, was the first to disclose the fraud, the Attorney General of Canada.
Although the case itself is suspicious, it is difficult to wash.
Many observers have pointed out that Trudo's five years of collapse, mainly by their own pit, and the biggest pit is no more than the three of the tiger's head snakes' tails, and the three articles of the law.
Canada's most authoritative Angus-Red poll data shows that since 2015, respondents who supported Trudo have declined from over 60 per cent to over 30 per cent, while opponents have risen from less than 30 per cent to over 60%.
Although other opposition parties and their heads are equally poor, even a significant part of the voters who are willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party, now do not think about the people of the Federal Prime Minister, the head of the ruling party.
On October 21, the new Canadian federal legislative election is about to begin, and Trudo can re-emergence five years ago?
The answer may be one word: hard.
The development of integration at the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from regional aviation integration, has far-reaching implications and positive significance.
On September 25th, Beijing Dae-hing International Airport officially sailed.
The New Kyoto newspaper journalist was informed from the Beijing City Development Commission that the capital airport was in a state of over-saturity and the opening of the International Airport will enhance the capacity of air services in the capital.
After Shanghai, Beijing became the second city with two airports in the same city, mainly in Shanghai Rainbow Bridge International Airport for domestic aviation services, and Pudong Airport, with international shipping aviation, and the future capital airport and Dae Xing Airport will also provide more detailed services to serve the differences between domestic and international aviation operations.
Da Xing Airport sails, from a business development perspective, is more beneficial for the capital airport.
The capital airport swallowed 100 million passengers in 2018, the country's top, but there is still a significant gap in the demand for international routes, especially in the demand for international routes.
To better serve domestic and foreign passenger tourism, travel, etc., adapted to Beijing's growing urban trends, and international access to cities, Da Xing International Airport, is located as a large international hub airport, and plans to meet 100 million passengers per year and 4 million tons of mail throughput.
So, two airports are not overlapping, and there are enough market space for different client groups.
At the economic accounting level, the flight of Dae-Hing International Airport clearly creates a win-win effect to ease the tension in Beijing air transport, accelerates the growth of passenger and cargo throughput and building an incremental cake for the dual nuclear operation of Capital Airlines.
From a user perspective, with the flight of Da Xing International Airport, there is no need to concentrate on the capital airport in the future, or reduce the range of problems posed by excessive concentration of routes, such as longer over-site security, slower passenger boarding, indirectly increasing the time spent between aircraft and passengers at the airport, increasing the burden on airport operations, reducing shipping through the capital airport, and has improved passenger travel experience.
According to media measurements of the time and costs of multiple traffic routes to large international airports, such as the high speed of the High Highway from the South Five Rings to the High Highway of Da Xing Airport, 50 minutes to drive, and the oil money is about $40, at a high speed of $15; and the choice of the orbital traffic subway line, which is limited to 20 km, 30 km, the fare is divided into $10, $25, 35 yuan; citizens can also travel to Kyo Hung, from Beijing West Station to Dae Xing Airport station for more than 20 minutes.
Overall, citizens have a variety of transport options, and costs and time are within a reasonable range.
And from a trend perspective: Dae-hyun Airport is located in Kyojin's traffic hub, so it's a little far from Beijing, but it strengthens radiation to Hebei, Tianjin, which facilitates more people, and it is important to pull Hebei, Tianjin's economic development.
In the future, Hebei, Tianjin passengers are entitled to more international air route services provided at Da Xing International Airport, which is visible from the transport plan at Dae-Hing Airport.
The transportation facilities at Da Xing Airport are very well-developed, and in addition to the new airport line at Da Xing Airport in Beijing City, there are several highways connected to Da Xing Airport and surrounding areas.
This is like Guangdong East, Fushan, Qingxiang, and so on the highways of Guangfu, Guanghua, Guangzhou, and residents of the Beijing surrounding gallery, the Yu An Xin district, will also benefit from Da Xing Airport and access to easy and efficient aviation services.
As can be seen, the access to the International Airport at Da Xing International Airport is not just a few runways and several aircraft, whether at the competitive level of the enterprise, the consumer experience level, or from regional aviation integration, and the development of the integration of Kyojin, has far-reaching implications and positive, not only about the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, not only the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, not only the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, but also at the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, but also at the long-term layout and development of the vast population in Beijing, but also promoting the development of the Beijing shipping industry, but also promoting the integrated development process in Kyojin Airport.
So, for the voyage at the airport, we're not only making an individual's small, but also a big deal of overall development.

The Viet Nam Forum on Economic and Social Issues was held in the province of Tianxiang, 2019
Nguyen De-Kin, Deputy Director of the Economic Commission of the Viet Nam Congress, revealed that early this year, Viet Nam ' s economic and social development had shown many new developments and continued to grow.
The Forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of 2019, proposing measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, representatives of the Conference exchanged views and views on the economic development situation and the impact of some FTAs in 2019, some prominent issues in the economy of Viet Nam in 2019, and four themes such as projections and recommendations for economic and social development in Viet Nam in 2020.
It was widely accepted that global economic growth slowed, risks and challenges increased in the first few months of 2019.
Trade frictions between major economies have further shrinking global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that, despite the uncertainty of the global economy, 70 per cent of the world’s economies are stagnating, the economic development of Viet Nam has achieved many encouraging achievements, macroeconomic smooth operation, inflation is effectively controlled, with an average growth of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019, with a minimum increase in almost three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, although below 7.05 per cent of the same period last year, the increase remained high compared to the same period 2011-2017.
In predicting trends in economic development in Viet Nam in 2019-2020, the Deputy Director of the Centre for Economic and Social Forecasting of Viet Nam stated that the Viet Nam economy had a high growth in 2019 in the context of the world economic turmoil.
The macroeconomics of Viet Nam are expected to remain largely stable by 2020, and the implementation of FTAs will contribute to trade development, economic restructuring, business environmental improvement, and a decline in Viet Nam ' s external export activities as a result of trade frictions.
Therefore, the monitoring early warning mechanism is needed to actively seek trade relief measures for exports to Vietnamese commodities, to find opportunities to expand new export markets and facilitate external exports of commodities such as agricultural and water products.
At the same time, inflation is controlled at reasonable levels, thereby promoting the development of assistive industries and support the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and eco-agriculture.
Liu Chijie, Director of the Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the new China.
Liu Zhijie said that China has been actively involved in international affairs for 70 years, contributing more Chinese wisdom and China programmes to improve global economic governance and promote global development, making an important contribution to world peace and development, and to bring real benefits to Cambodia ' s economic development and the well-being of people.

Ten years of "The Cloud Rise" in Cloudstown, the Xinhua Network.
If the 2009 local website forum is the original point, the 2019 Cloud Habitat Congress held in Hangzhou for 10 years.
From a concept of the cloud fog to the practice of "up clouds", big data, cloud computing became one of the core technologies that support China's economic development, social management, public services over 10 years.
In the Shintai New Energy Photovolt Battery Workshop in Heining, recently a new "co-worker" with Aliyun artificial intelligence.
It's 24 hours, it's more than twice as fast as manual, and the quality check accuracy rate is stable at over 95%.
According to the company's head, the quality examiner with the camera has focused on over 40,000 defective samples, and with the cloud computing power behind it, it quickly converts infrared images into binary languages and place defective battery pieces.
This company is just a microcosm of the cloud computing industry transformation today.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the Guide to Promoting the Implementation of the Clouds (2018-2020) in 2018 and proposed by 2020 to achieve a significant increase in corporate cloud awareness and motivation, with a significant increase in the proportion of clouds and applications.
According to the founder of Aliyun, Wang Kin, today, data-centred cloud computing has built bridges for the digital economy of key elements, opening up the way.
Meanwhile, our cloud computing industry has been expanding for 10 years.
The White Paper on Cloud Calculator Development (2019), released by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July this year, shows that the overall market for cloud computing in China amounted to $9.28 billion in 2018, an increase of 39.2 per cent over 2017.
Besides becoming a key technology to support industrial transformation, digital economic development, the invisible cloud has changed urban management and social life without realizing it.
This year, the "city brain" that was seen for three years in a row is still a matter of concern.
Aliyun describes that the urban brain has now become the central centre of urban management from transport governance tools, and the relevant cooperative applications have been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brains can achieve new urban management services such as "stop and after parking" through powerful computing capabilities.
In the field of government services, "one cloud" docking one thing, we're going to work together, and cloud computing has facilitated both sides of the supply of government services.
Zhejiang has now built a unified public data platform across the province through the government.
As of 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and over 15 million corporate units in the province, bringing together data of the 3066 category of 19.80 billion in governance.
The average number of people in Zhejiang Province has been called on average monthly, with 12 million shared data, and data are moving on the cloud every time, which may mean that the crowd is running less legs.
Be careful to make tea with plastic tea!
According to the Central Society, a recent Canadian study found that a package of plastic tea packs could release billions, even billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than the number of microplastics estimated by a person throughout the year, but there is no evidence that the intake of plastic particles can pose a threat to humanity.
Researchers at McGill University, Canada, reportedly found that plastic tea bags were immersed in a glass of almost boiled hot water (95 degrees Celsius), and that the tea bag would release about 116 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanomite particles to a cup.
This number is significantly higher than the number of microplastics estimated by a person throughout the year.
According to the research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles per year, while inhaling the same number of microplastics.
According to the information received, the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea packs at the Montelow Shop and Café, open the tea bag, and immersed the tea bag in almost boiling water for five minutes, and then analyze it with electronic microscopes and spectrometers.
According to this study, they found that a single tea bag released over 1.6 billion plastic particles, " several higher levels than the plastic load of other foods " .
According to reports, most tea bags are made of natural fibres, but many use natural fibres to make tea bags still use plastic to seal their mouths.
Some of the brand tea bags are no longer used to paper, and they're using plastics, and these plastic tea bags are the subject of researchers testing.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastics, and researchers define the size of these microplastics between 100 and 5 cents, mainly by plastic waste.
Researchers have found these microplastics in air, soil, rivers and deep ditches around the world, tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first found plastic particles in human excreta samples in several countries of different regions around the world in October 2018.
To test the potential toxicity of tea packs to release plastic particles, the Canadian research team placed fleas in contaminated water, and found that microplastics affect the behaviour of these fleas and to make them develop malformations.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence that the intake of plastic particles poses a threat to humanity.
However, WHO noted that more research was needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what they had on humans.
Researchers speculate that these tea packs release a large amount of plastic particles may be exposed to boiling water, and that even when the "eat-grade" plastics may be decomposed or seepage toxic substances even when the "eat-grade" plastics are heating to over 40 degrees Celsius.
Gutrez says climate emergencies are the greatest threat to the survival of small island countries.
There, a natural disaster erodes the development of a generation.
This is what the floods have been hit by hurricanes, Dominica and the Bahamas since this year.
About a quarter of small island developing States live at 5 metres or lower altitude.
Relocations may seriously affect their social and lifestyles, even issue sovereignty and national identity.
At the Climate Action Summit this Monday, small island countries worked together to achieve carbon and 100% renewable energy by 2030, thus leading the world in the right direction.
Gutrez said, " The climate crisis is building new injustices on old injustices.
Despite the small contribution of small island developing States to global warming, the highest cost.
As these countries are in middle-income status, many countries are still in the accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.
The world must act, and it is time to make significant decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States ... "
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for seeking to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-adaptable infrastructure and ways to transform renewable energy; urges international agencies to help small island developing States, particularly in debt, middle-income countries.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of the protection and conservation of the Earth ' s lifeline – the ocean.
The latest special report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week confirms that the oceans have "rolled" serious consequences of the climate crisis.
By the mid-century, many regions may have had an extreme sea level rise every year in a century.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.
In the last 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.
Industry, shipping, mining and tourism demand is leading to reduced resources, including the maintenance of fishing sites in many island communities.
Small island countries also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They depend heavily on some external markets to make them floating.
Some countries are also working to address the security effects of illicit trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.
Gutrez said: " By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, this problem can be solved anywhere ...
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples available worldwide ... "
He stressed that small island developing States were a special example of sustainable development.
They need long-term attention and investment of the international community as a whole.
The Indian Ministry of Finance has indicated that the financial system is sufficiently mobile.
Indian Treasury Minister West Taraman stated that the current financial system was fully mobile and that India’s economic growth was expected to recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by the demand for holiday consumption.
West Taraman made the statement following meetings with representatives of institutions such as private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks, etc.
West Taraman didn't explain the targeting of these statements.
Some of the previous Indian media and overseas media blame the continued slowdown in India's current economy on liquidity tensions in non-bank financial institutions.
West Taraman, for example, has rejected liquidity tension as the main cause of falling sales.
West Taraman pointed out that the decline in car sales was mainly influenced by cyclical factors.
West Taraman expects that India’s economic growth may resume in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
India's annual shopping season will last until the end of September.
Markets expect that shopping consumption will greatly contribute to India ' s economic growth.

"Some over-age farmers on the site are estimated to account for more than half.
Where are we going to find young workers?
There's no way to use so many old people on the site. "
Recently, there have been a number of over-age farmers on the site (over retirement age), and Zou Qui, who has been an engineering contractor in the construction industry for years.
In recent times, the Chinese college has been working on rain-fouling projects, and there have been a lot of farmers on campus, and if you look carefully, there will be a lot of over-age farmers in this area.
Over-age farmers are not "free," but because "no free" and "no free" and hard work – whether they save money to solve their old age and medical problems or help their children, drive these old people who should "free" continue to work hard.
The "old farmer" is not as easy as we thought.
Child-rearing, maintenance of the elderly, for children to read, help children build cars, help children to build cars, help children become a family business, and raise their grandchildren, when these farmers have completed their "life mission," the bag has been empty and even a lot of debt, mostly lack of wealth accumulation.
To keep their children alive and to save themselves more wealth, many farmers insist on "to do it."
Many new generation farmers after 80, after "90" and "after 00" are reluctant to work hard, working-intensive second or low-end services, causing structural "work waste" that lacks attractive jobs, providing opportunities for over-age farmers.
Because of the lack of one skill, physical and working capacity has declined, a number of over-age farmers are strong, low-income, high-risk, less secure jobs.
One day is a day, a little more, a little bit more, the survival dilemma of over-age farmers behind "no free" cannot be ignored and ignored.
Addressing the problem of pay and payroll, sound labour protection, reduce safety risks, increase labour revenues, improve the survival of overage farmers, and, in addition to their "self-receivation", are also not free of public sector system protection and human care.
Some scholars have pointed out that overage farmers are no longer likely to rely on their home land to solve their problems such as old age and medical care, and that they must feed their families through other ways.
The help of reading over-age farmers' "no free" help us better understand the love and pain of over-age farmers.
Seeing the back of the overage farmer workers, hearing their sighs, trying to get back to the countryside, and they really get back to the country, and they need to be "old-minded," and the public sector, the market and society sharing responsibility in the good interaction, and it requires multiple efforts.
Chemezov said that Russia will not export this system in the next five years, because "the first of all, it will not be exported " .
This approach is fully in line with international practice.
The main producer of weapons and military equipment always ensures the needs of the defence services before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Grehoff, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force, said that the system was about to be completed.
The S-500 system was developed by the "Kolden-Ante" air defense.
This is a new generation of air defence systems that uses the working principles for destroying ballistics and aerodynamics.
The main role of S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles and intercept missiles below 3,500 kilometres of range.
In addition, according to some information, S-500 can destroy high ultrasound cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of drones, more than five times the sound speed of high ultrasound missiles, even near space targets.
This weapon can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems, especially S-400 systems, which is very important from a defence perspective.
Sergei Chemezov expressed special attention to S-400.
He said the system had a lot of demand in the world, but the Russian army needed it, including the Arctic.
S-400 air defence systems in the Arctic Air Defence Corps.
According to information on 15 September, the conversion of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system on the New Island Arctic Air Defence Corps has been completed.
This is not Russian militarization in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is a process within the transition plan for a more advanced defence tool towards the north.
According to the Russian Northern Fleet News Service, " With the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, the controlled airspace in the Arctic has increased significantly ... "
Very important, according to the military assessment, the system is very successful in the polar and Arctic regions.
Air defence officers trained the new system and prepared for combat duty.
It was equipped with a S-300 remote air defence system, and it's still a part of it.
Speaking of air defence systems, it must have weapons that destroy various air targets, whether it's the target of high-speed flight at the outer altitude or the "fish of the net" near the protected facility.
According to public sources, the S-400 "Trimph" system, developed by the Golden Diamond-Ante Sky Defense, was designed for attack strategies and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high ultrasound targets and other air attack weapons.
This weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within 400 km of range and shoot down ballistic targets flying at 4.8 km per second within a distance of 60 km.
Russia never hides its additional deployment of air defence forces in the polar north to ensure the safety of the northern sea road.
Not long ago, the first 12 Tor-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic region, sufficient to form an air defence camp to strengthen air defence systems in the Arctic.
The Russian Ministry of Defense then said that the Arctic Thor forces would be extended to a complete travel formation in the future.
Plus the S-400 remote system deployed to the New Island and the Cora Peninsula and the short-range system deployed in the polar North region, these advanced air defence weapons have worked to defend Russia's polar sky.
The enemy's planes, helicopters and drone missiles will be difficult to break this defense.
According to the Russian government, the flagship store will be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods to avoid the complex and long process of opening their own shop.
The Russian company, as an Russian store operator, focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
The largest Chinese trading platforms such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduodoo, Hand Q (ShouQ), multi-purpose instant communication software Wechat have online shops and owns their own online platforms, Epinduo.com and Russian commodity retail chains.
The Russian Export Center will work with Russia to develop shop marketing strategies and participation standards and screen virtual shelf product enterprises.
The store plans to open up at least 10 Russian manufacturers by the end of this year.
According to Russian Export Centers, the total number of Chinese electrician platforms visited 1 billion times a month.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have grown steadily since 2014, with over $1 billion in 2018.
At present, the Ali Baba Group will also open pilot shops to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the global import strategy.
According to Alexei Kojevnikov, the new store will present goods for enterprises with at least 500 million roubles.
Honestly, I expect more than 500 million roubles.
We all know that Chinese consumers are very positive about Russian commodities, considering our commodities as high-quality and green products ... "
Kojevnikov says the competition for Chinese consumers with a strong purchasing power is intense and is increasing.
He said, " Our goal is ambitious and 500 businesses are launched through this store in three years ... "
At the same time, the platform will be on the products of Russian Far East Enterprises.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of Trade Policy, University of Economics, Russia, said: " This is a political project representing the image of both sides, as the Russian export centre is state-owned, not private institutions ... "
"I don't see a large number of very competitive Russian commodities in the market. "
He thinks the project is likely not to be implemented, but it will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to Russian News Agency, Andrey Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Center, stated during the Eastern Economic Forum that more than 170 Russian enterprises had been published on the largest international wholesale line platform, Alabama.com, both in China and other countries.
In addition, there is a model of collaboration with the Ali Baba Group, an expert training project for Russian enterprises from the University of Treasures, which was held in July this year.
In November this year, the Russian Export Centre will also be the organizers of Russian enterprises participating in industry exhibitions and business projects at the second China International Import Fair in November this year.
A large exhibition will be held in 1,000 square metres of exhibition hall, which will also be the centre of commercial project events, agreement signing ceremony, presentation and talks with Chinese business representatives.
About 50 applications from Russian agricultural enterprises have been received.
The Russian Export Centre News Service said: " In addition to the agricultural stand, we will hold business meetings, i.e. to arrange direct links between entrepreneurs ... "
"This is another direction of our efforts to support and ensure that dozens of specialized meetings are arranged for them ... "
In addition, the fair will hold a master's class, cooking contest and Russian food fair for cooking in the "Shanghai Station for the Exploration of Russian Foods".

Xinhua Time Review: We're not moving our own path.
The White Paper on China and the World of the New Age, released on 27: China has been successful in 70 years because, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the right path of Chinese socialism and walked along this path.
China is a choice of history, people's choice.
In recent times, in the environment where poverty is weak, internal and worried, a generation of volunteers are asking for a search for the path to save the nation, and then to follow.
However, " Constitutional monarchy, re-establishment of the emperor, parliamentary, multiparty, presidential system, has thought about it, and it's not working. "
It was not until the Communist Party of China, with the new China, the Chinese people gradually opened a path of socialism in practice.
China's path is the path of happiness for the Chinese people, the path of the revival of the Chinese nation and the path of China to develop together with the world.
It's because on the right path that China can do its business to become the second largest economy in the world, and the country that has contributed to global economic growth, to make the world a world with its own development.
As the White Paper points out, this path of development in China is in line with China's national situation and adaptation to the times, and will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people value this right path.
Chinese people know the South Orange North, understand that what suits others are not necessarily suitable for themselves, only for themselves.
It's with this path confidence and strategic strength that China has created a remarkable miracle.
In the curve process of moving forward to mankind, the final conclusion of history was famous.
Today, the success of the Chinese-specific socialist path has declared the end of the historical conclusion, the collapse of the Chinese crash theory, the failure of the socialist failure.
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve the power of the rich and the rich, expanding the way developing countries move to modernization, and provide experience and learning for countries and peoples in the world that both want to accelerate development and want to maintain their own independence and their own national circumstances.
The world is rich and colorful.
China has always respected the right of States to choose their own path to development.
China does not "enter" foreign models, nor "output" Chinese models, but will be determined to move their own path, achieve their own evolving development, and to strengthen the governance of the country and to make a contribution to the common realization of good governance.
In Fair Work Commission, the owner of the Foodworks supermarket fired a 66-year-old female worker by texting, because he prefers to hire employees from Asian backgrounds, and the boss's approach was severely criticized as "decent."
The Committee stated that the way Ms. Gail Ayton, who worked at Wagga Wagga's shop for over 20 years, Jianbin Wang, Eddie, was " extremely unfair " and may violate the anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016, and he's been trying to fire me because she wasn't Chinese.
In this case, Peter Sams, Vice-President of the Committee, conducted a search on the Internet and found that Mr. Wang had previously published some recruitment advertisements at various Australian Chinese employment forums " .
One of the job requirements listed in these positions says "the first Asian lady," and the other says "first Asian employees."
The third post says he's more inclined to overseas people.
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by texting in April this year, later claiming that it was due to her absence and a small amount of cash missing from $5.10 to $30 on the cash register.
But Mr. Sams said that Mr. Wang's reasons for firing Ms. Ayton were weak and lack of evidence.
She's been out of duty for three years, and she's got a few Australian dollars.
He said that Ms. Ayton was fired "in fact not related to her behavior or performance."
He said: " In my opinion, with the support of the evidence of Mr. Wang's recruitment ad, the real motive to fire her is that he prefers to hire an Asian background ...
According to article 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang ' s actions form illegal violations of anti-discrimination laws and/or dismissal of the applicant ... "
Mr. Sams said it was inappropriate to consider restoring her position, given Mr. Wang's terrible treatment of Ms. Ayton.
He should consider paying Ms. Ayton, a temporary worker with an hourly salary of $26.
Given the possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams stated that he would submit his decisions and documents to the head of the Committee to consider whether Mr. Wang should be transferred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He said Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any chance to respond to the grounds that allegedly fired her.
He said, " I think that the defense of injustice and prejudice to dismiss the applicant, Mr. Wang, "waiting" opportunity, he believed that it would be "prove" to terminate the applicant's employment. "
"He was wrong... and the argument that the applicant had completely ignored her any natural and just treatment, and it was shocking that he was rude and extremely unjust. "
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks is a small enterprise, " it must be frankly that no decent employer will not fire employees in a very unfair and in a manner recognized in the present case ... "
He said, " It's shameful and extremely unfair. "

According to CNN, Mansinelli emigrated to the United States at the age of eight, helping clean the floor at a barber shop, and started picking up scissors to serve the guests at 12 to ease the economic pressure at home.
Mansinelli was in primary school, but he didn't graduate.
Robert, the son of Mansinelli, revealed that Dad loved his job and people from all over the world liked him, but Dad was always diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and that was not retired because he was planning to wait for himself to get better and cut his hair.

The company's repurchased over $100 billion in the year, and it's a record high-level network.
To stabilize the company's stock prices and maintain the image of the company, listed companies have started to buy shares frequently in the last two years, hoping to transmit the value of the company undervalued the value to the market, thereby stable stock prices and increasing investor confidence.
Eastern Wealth Choice data show that listed companies spent $79 billion in 2017 for repurchase shares, increased dramatically to $51 billion in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of A listed companies had exceeded $100 billion, creating a new high amount of A-stock buyback and far more than the previous year.
From the purpose of the buyback, the company's repurchase shares appear to be the same as the increase in major shareholders, but there are significant differences in implementing subjects, sources of funds, buyback uses, stock-owned interests, etc.
In an interview with the Journal of Securities Daily, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai MacKing Information Consulting Limited, Xuyang, stated that the " Views on supporting the return of listed companies " , which were repurchased in November 2018, which had been repaired in the narrow range of shares, complex decision-making procedures and inadequate inventory systems, which had increased significantly since the policy had previously encouraged listed companies to buy shares back, and that the repurchase of shares had increased significantly in the year.
In January this year, the branch officially issued the Rules for the Implementation of the Repurchase of Shares by listed companies, which expanded the sources of repurchase of funds by listed companies, properly simplify implementation procedures, guide improved governance arrangements and encourage various listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee equity schemes.
After the opinion came out, the listed companies performed the repurchase of shares, with more applicable, the repurchase process was simpler, and the repurchase of shares was more motivated.
Repurchase of shares in relatively low locations is also conducive to the efficiency of the use of funds by listed companies, thereby increasing the profitability of each share and increase the return on net assets and reduce the pressure on corporate profit indicators.
The value of the repurchase of shares by listed companies is more important than large shareholders and reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their active market value management and cash flows.
Xu Yang believes that stock prices are underestimated as the main factor in the return of the listed company, and the stock prices of the company no longer reflect the future prospects for the company, so that such companies deserve investor attention, but cannot invest blindly, and need to focus on the financial statements of such listed companies and specific operations.
The listed companies with large-scale repurchases show at least the confidence and financial strength of the company.
The enthusiasm for the return of A listed companies has gradually warmed up and regularizing the repurchase behaviour, and data show that nearly thousands of listed companies have already implemented shares to buy back this year, and the leading companies in all industries have become the main power of the market for repurchase.
China has recently disclosed the progress of the buyback that companies have accumulated the A share of 57.5.9 million shares through centralized competitive transactions, accounting for 0.315 per cent of the company ' s total equity, and the total amount of funds paid totalled $5 billion (excluding transaction costs), and that the repurchase of shares would be used in the employee stock-holding scheme, including but not limited to but not limited to the long-term service plans that were considered by the Corporate Shareholders ' Conference.
The Ely shares have paid $5,792 million for the repurchase of shares and has recently adjusted the use of the repurchase of shares, and the original plan to "purchase all shares will be used as a later source of equity incentives" to "the cumulative purchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares are used to implement equity incentives, and the remaining 3.4.9 million shares will be used to write off to reduce registered capital " .
The Ili shares indicated that the write-off of some of the repurchased shares would facilitate further upgrading the level of return per share and to effectively increase the return on the investment of the company shareholders.
The TCL Group released a progress announcement on return on September 25, which showed that the TCL Group had accumulated 3.59% of the company's shares, which cost $1.65 billion.
The TCL Group Board Office stated to journalists in the Securities Daily that the repurchase of shares would be used for employee equity schemes, equity incentives or corporate bonds that could be converted to shares issued by listed companies.
TCL Group insists on established business strategies, continuously improving competitiveness and sustained healthy development.
Based on confidence in the future of the company and investor interests, combined with the performance of the second-tier market in the last year and taking into account the factors such as the company ' s business and financial situation, the company plans to use its own funds, self-financing and other financing methods to buy back their shares.
The former chief economist of the Sea Open Source Fund, Yang Delong, said that the operation of the listed companies repurchased stocks could reduce the number of shares in the market and increase the proceeds of each share of listed companies, which is an important benefit for the second market; and that listed companies are willing to take out the real gold silver and buy back from the stock market, which greatly boosts market confidence.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, especially the performance stock, which is a very good way to boost investor confidence through stock buybacks.
The Hunan Provincial Council Standing Committee, Secretary of the Changsha City Council, Hu Jinhua and the four main leaders of the Engineering Machinery Manufacturing Company – the world's leading engineering machinery industry cluster after three or five years later.
Building the world's leading engineering machinery cluster in Changsha, and in the current fashionable words, it's the best on the surface.
As a city of the Inland Province, Changsha shouted this loud word.
With the power of the helium side leaks.
Four engineering machinery companies who participated in this conversation, covering the sky, underground, sea, land-wide field: light aircraft with mountain river intelligence, concrete transport pumps, three heavy-duty ground cranes, iron heavy-working tunnel shields, and their "hard power" is a one-way, a "hard power" that is one-way, proud of the male.
Once upon a time, China had almost no voice in the field of engineering machinery.

The government of the stars is the same as the moon.
Development of the dominant industries requires both enterprise progress and positive government action.
The reputation of Changsha has the capital of engineering machinery, which brings together the entire industrial chain from upstream to downstream, creating a number of associated industrial clusters and has been significantly reduced by optimizing the business environment, improving the services, simplified approval processes, etc., and the development of enterprises, manufacturing and marketing costs.
Good business ecology, making engineering machinery manufacturing companies come.
History has pushed Changsha to the front desk to build a leading global engineering machine, and I don't want it.
Whether it's a government or a business, and even a relevant producer, should take the opportunity, move forward, bite the target, continue to contribute to the construction of the powerful power.

Gansu Qingyang: The lake sheep come to the "out of poverty."
The autumn of September is replaying the Yellow Land Plateau.
In the professional cooperative in the town of Yuma, the 58-year-old villagers Shavili put the last grass in the sheep's ring, kept by the sink, watching the white lake sheep chew.
"Eat it, and when the winter is full of twilight, you can sell a good price."
Shavily said he fed sheep every day "special nutrition," regularly clean up, disinfected, carefully served without being slow.
Shaville raised sheep for over 20 years, and it didn't know how rough the sheep were before they came to work at the cooperative.
Shavili is from the village of the summer flood pool village in Qingyang City, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His left-neighborhood is full of sheep, but he insists on the traditional dispersion, the poor quality of the sheep, the small number of columns.
In June this year, with the leadership of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Shavily's been working on it all day because he's always holding a lot of energy.
The stockers are poor, and they're all hosting sheep to cooperatives, and they can split the money at the end of the year, and they're all counting on him.
Good thing he learned to protect the disease, he learned to prevent the disease, to master science, and became a few "good-track" in the village.
The professional cooperative for the pro-people farming is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds with nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
Zou Tao, head of the cooperative, said that there was a doorway inside and outside the standardized sheep shed.
"The wool is thick, easy to feed bacteria, and lake sheep can't stay in hot and wet places, and the shed must be built in three-sided ditches and have to be replaced by windmills to vent the heat. "
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent the disease, it would have to disinfect the sheep's sheds regularly and put three to four bullets for sheep in a quarter.
In addition to living well, we'll have to eat grass mixed with green corn, wheat grass, thorium, and have enough wide "the playground" to stretch the bones.
Cooperatives adopt a hosting approach to lead local farmers to put good lake sheep here, unified breeding, management, marketing, good seedization, scientificization, standardization, assembly farming.
Today, 140 poor households in the sheep share, over $6,000 per household each year, with four set-up cards working in cooperatives.
From "Manding" to "precision feeding," from "local mating" to "manic insemination," from "watching, belly-touching" to "B super"... in Gansu Qingyang, meat and sheep farming is not just a shift in feeding, and the model of "Longhead Enterprise + Cooperative + Farmer" changed the sight of the former "fishing on the slopes, selling sheep in the market", overcome the weakness of traditional agricultural and livestock, and the poor days of farmers became better because modern sheep were better.
Zou Tao said that if the market price was weak, the local leading company Gansu-Sing Agricultural Development Ltd. would be bought at a market protection price of $27 per kilogram to help farmers spread market risks.
Xu Jian Feng, General Adviser to Gansu China Agricultural and Livestock Development Ltd., said that by providing loan guarantees for poor households, sheep supply, order farming, offer acquisition, uniform processing sales, etc.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved a steady increase in harvest through the "companiment" farming, breeding, mass farming, slaughter division, market sales.
Qingyang City is in the north of the farm and herds, and the grass is rich.
There are currently 913 meat and sheep-scale farms in the city, cooperatives, sheep and sheep raising more than 5 million meat and sheep, and two 1.3 million meat sheep slaughter-slaughter production lines, and sheep are becoming a "head sheep" that is pro-poor in the land.
The French finance minister said it would cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros next year and called on Germany to follow up.
Reuters Paris, September 26th - French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France would cut taxes by more than $10.9 billion next year, and Germany should keep up with France's fiscal stimulus to revive the depressed economy.

The ECB reduced interest rate to a record low on September 12th and plans to restart the purchase of debt to pressure the cost of borrowing, hoping to inspire economic recovery and boost inflation.
" Low interest rates will not re-emerge Europe, monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough, " Lemel said to journalists ...
"Germany needs to invest now, as soon as possible... don't wait until the situation gets worse and move again, he adds...
He has made this appeal to Germany many times.
France has implemented tax cuts of more than 10 billion euros this year, bringing a great boost to France's economic growth.
And the global economy is out of power and the German economy that relies on exports is the first to be the best.
Lemel notes that the tax burden of French families will reduce the tax burden of Euro9.3 billion next year, including 5 billion euros in income tax relief.
Moreover, as the corporate tax rate will fall from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over five years, the tax burden of enterprises will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros.

Research: Small growth in the national health diet index in the United States, but still challenges - China New Network
According to the American Overseas News Network, a recent study in the United States shows that for 16 years, the United States government's health diet index has grown moderately, from 56 to 58.
But in the case of 100 points, it's not worth celebrating.
American nationals still face "a significant challenge" on their diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fong, a nutrition researcher at the University of Tafts, Massachusetts, said that Americans still had too much intake of food that could cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, which are the most common diseases in American nationals.
The study was published in the American Medical Society magazine on 24th.
The study is based on the findings of the health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the United States Government from 1999 to 2016.
The authors wrote that " despite significant improvements, significant dietary challenges remain " .
These challenges are known to include reducing the intake of snacks, hot dogs, fat cattle, butter, etc., including saturated fat.
The study found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people's daily diet increased from 11.5 to 12%, exceeding the recommended 10% intake ceiling.
The biggest improvement in the diet of the United States is that the intake of sugar has dropped from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
It is officially believed that sugar should be less than 10% in the daily diet.
For the reasons of the reduction in sugar intake, researchers believe that it is related to the reduction in drinking sweet soda, but Zhang Fang has stressed that sugar is often added to food that is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
The intake of fruit, nuts, oatmeal and other whole grain categories has increased slightly by adults in the United States.
However, data for 2016 show that these foods still account for less than 5% of their daily diets.
Although the intake of salt is slightly reduced, the reduction in drinking juice has led to low-quality carbohydrates intake, Zhang Fang said that they still account for 42% of the daily heat, many of which come from fine white-faced bread and other fine grain.
The study is based on a biennial personal health survey that will make adults remember the food they eat in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asking questions every few days since 2003.
The government's diet guide to the United States residents recommends that people use a healthy diet model to reduce the possibility of chronic diseases.
The guide states that people should take more nutritious and dense foods such as vegetables, fruit, whole grain, low-fat dairy products, and protein seafood, skinny meat, poultry, eggs, seed food.
During the study, the number of diabetes among American nationals almost doubled, over 7%, and obesity has increased over many years between research – now about 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese.
Besides, heart disease remains the main cause of death by American nationals.

The deepest record of the Chinese railway tunnel was refreshed.
On September 27, the China New Society, which was built on September 27th, the well reached 762.59 metres below the ground, breaking the deepest record of the Chinese railway tunnel well, which was created in a large number of water surges.
The tunnel of the Golegon Hill of the Great 34.5 km long is located in Yunnan, and the tunnel is the longest tunnel in the Asian double-line single hole.
This tunnel travels through 19 fractures, with a maximum depth of 1155 metres, because it covers almost all tunnel construction of bad geology and major risks, and the Golegon Hill Tunnel is known as the "geological museum " for tunnel construction.
The wells are the most important auxiliary pits in the Goligon Hill Tunnel, with important tasks to increase their operating surfaces to achieve "long short-twilight" and later railway operations ventilation.
The first well was successfully dug to the bottom of the well, marking the official entry into the horizontal tunnel in the Golegon Hill tunnel, which could increase four operational surfaces under the well after the ground was dug and equipped to accelerate the drilling of the tunnel.
"The wells are all granite layers, because the granite layer is more cracks, and it can't stop water, from top to down, basically as deep as the wells are as high as it is. "
The chief engineer of the Dare Railway Project Department of the Central Iron Tunnel Bureau told journalists that there were several mudslides, collapses, etc., and the construction of experts invited experts to put the pulse on the site, and more than 20 seminars.
"The maximum water in the wells is over 300 cubic metres per hour, over 700 metres deep, with water pressure equivalent to 700 metres deep under the seabed ... "
" If you don't take the drain in time, we'll drown the well 10 meters in an hour, and we're almost 85% of the time to cure water, 15% of the time to dig in. "
To overcome the geological challenges such as the vertical development of the well-seated rock, the water-rich, water-rich granite, the tunnel construction uses a system of water treatment measures that are combined with "detect, bet, dig" and reduce construction risks.
After several improvements, the construction of a well No. 1 formed a dig-up system, a suspension system, a hanger system, a winch upgrade system, and has achieved eye-blowing, blasting, out, template installation, concrete construction, and accelerated construction progress.
Eventually, after construction over 1,200 days and night, the wells successfully completed the depth of 762.59 meters.
The Great Swe Railway is 330 km long, an important component of the International Channel in China and Myanmar, and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the "Away" building.

The 2019 Earth Guard Award was held in New York, United States, 26th, and the "Ant Forest" project, which led the "Intelligence and Action" project with mobile phone mini-programs to drive hundreds of millions of people involved in environmental action.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced a list of awards at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but people who participated in the award ceremony that day remained difficult to be excited.
In an interview with Xinhua, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, In-Ear Annos, said that the "Ant Forest" was an exciting innovation that it had made hundreds of millions of people act to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans could do for the environment.
It connects people to the environment with technology, allowing every individual to participate in the protection of the Earth, which will have a huge impact.
The Ant Forest was launched in August 2016 by the Chinese Ant Financial Services Group (Ant Gold Clothes) in August 2016, and users saved "green energy" through recording their green travel in their daily lives in their daily lives, paying online low-carbon action such as utilities, and "plant trees" on the mobile phone.
Every virtual tree that users grow into a virtual tree, ant forest and a public good partner grow the next real tree in desertification.
As of August this year, 500 million ants forest users had accumulated carbon reductions by 7.92 million tons, growing 122 million trees in desertification areas.
In the Earth Guard Award that day, Costa Rica won the award for national environmental efforts, and the award-winning President Carlos Alvarado of Costa Rica praised the contribution of the Ant Forest, "which can inspire so many people to participate in green action " .
The chairman and CEO of the Ant Gold Clothes, Ii Hyun-dong, said that the Earthguard Award was a recognition of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible to participate in low-carbon life, and this honor belongs to all participants.
Ii Hyun-dong said that the ants forest has affected 500 million people over the past three years, and the goal of the ants forest over the next three years is to lead 1 billion people worldwide to participate in low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how farmers earn more from green water.
In addition to providing employment opportunities through trees, it is also hoped to help farmers achieve revenue through agricultural development projects, electrician platforms, etc.
The digital technology-based public interest environmental model created by the Ant Forest also successfully sailed by other countries.
In June this year, the largest electronic wallet in the Philippines launched the Philippine version of Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon lives.
It was described that GCash will work with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, etc., to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the launch of the project.
The Earthguard Award is the highest award in the field of environmental protection in the United Nations, once a year.

Trade friction affects the American economy's report card.
The US Economic Report Card in the second quarter of this year shows that the growth of GDP in the United States has significantly slowed over the previous quarter, affected by a significant decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts noted that economic frictions and their uncertainty were the main cause of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revision data published by the United States Department of Commerce on 26 showed that US GDP grew by 2% annually in the second quarter, which was the same as the previously published revised data, but significantly below 3.1 per cent in the quarter.
Data show that consumption growth has become a major factor in supporting economic growth in the second quarter.
The annual consumption expenditure of about 70 per cent of the total United States economy increased by 4.6 per cent in the season, and 3.03 percentage points of economic growth.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment boosted 0.82 percentage points of economic growth.
However, private sector investment declined by 6.3% in the second quarter, dragging the economic growth of 1.16 percentage points in the season; exports declined by 5.7% compared to the previous quarter, net exports dragged 0.68 percentage points in the current season.
According to Barry Knap, the management partner of the Ansed Macroeconomic Consulting Company in the United States, said that private sector investment not only did not maintain the momentum of growth last year, but rather a significant decline, because economic friction and rising uncertainty hit corporate confidence.
Knap believes that next year ' s corporate capital spending is expected to remain declining next year, with policy uncertainty.
Analysts believe that despite the strong support of consumption growth for the United States economy in the second quarter, there are increasing indications that economic and trade frictions and their uncertainty have affected consumer confidence and have a negative impact on the future of consumption in the United States.
The head of the survey, Richard Cortin, Professor of Economics, University of Michigan, said that in the last survey, 38 per cent of consumers had mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, which was a new and a half year and a half.
For future economic trends in the United States, analysts generally believe that the US economy will continue to slow down.
But there are experts who say that if economic and trade frictions are mitigated, the performance of the United States industry and financial markets will improve.
The global economist of the British Economist Think Tank, Karen Burch, predicts that the future US economy will continue the downward trend since this year, with an increase to a lower level than in the second quarter.
The chief economist of Moody's Analysis Company, Mark Zandy, predicts that, the US economy will grow at 2.3% this year, and will slow further to 1.6% next year.
Ellen Hatchen, the investment manager of Patnan Investment Corporation, stated that the greatest concern of the current enterprise was the economic and trade dispute and its uncertainty, and that uncertainty would be significantly reduced and that the industrial sector would perform much better than it is now.
Miller-Tabak Asset Management Stock strategist Matt Merley said that economic and trade friction remained a "first issue" and was the main reason for the massive volatility of the United States capital market this year, and that economic and trade frictions would be the key to affecting the movement of the United States capital market in the rest of this year.

Minister of Finance Liu Kun: 67 companies and financial institutions have transferred the State to $861 billion to the Social Security Fund.
Minister of Finance, Liu Kun, stated that, to date, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions had completed the transfer of some State-owned capital-rich social security funds, totalling approximately $861 billion.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the deployment of the work of some of the State-owned capital replenishment funds jointly by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources Social Security and the National Commission.
" The transfer of some State-owned capital-rich social security funds is an important initiative to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system, which is an intergenerational expression of universal sharing and equity in the basic pension insurance system for State-owned enterprise development results and is a current and long-term policy measure ... "
In 2017, the State Council issued the Implementation Programme for the Transfer of Some State Capital Enrichment Fund, which requires the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces for piloting.
According to Liu Kun, the pre-division process has yielded positive results.
At the central level, three transfers of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been completed, with a total transfer of approximately $861 billion in State-owned capital.
Of these, the transfer of central financial institutions in the Ministry of Finance to perform the duties of the fundee has been largely completed.
Central business transfer has a certain scale.
At the local level, the pre-division of enterprises is carried out.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in the provinces of Yunnan was largely completed, with a transfer of 15.8 billion yuan and $18.5 billion, respectively.
In addition to pilot provinces, other provinces have carried out pre-referral preparations, laying the foundation for the next step.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources Social Security, the National Council, the General Tax Administration, the SEC issued a joint notice, the central and local transfer of some of the State-owned capital equity funds was fully launched in 2019 and was largely completed by 2020.
The meeting held on that day provided specific deployments to the full roll-off process.
The meeting stressed the need for practical and efficient delivery.
"In accordance with progress arrangements, the transfer will be largely completed by the end of 2020.
Rotation of working hours and task weight ... "

The state-funded social security fund – from the beginning of the "Enrichment of the Social Security Fund" bag, the destination is to provide strong support for old-age security.
But the author believes that this is not a simple "physical shift" but a "mathematic addition."
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources, the State Council, the General Tax Administration, the SEC jointly issued a " circular on the full roll-off of the work of the State-owned capital enrichment fund " , which clearly identified the schedule for the transfer of the Social Security Fund, namely, the Central and Local Transfer of the State-owned Social Security Fund, which was fully launched in 2019.
After the documents were published, the Treasury and others were implemented quickly.
On September 25th, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10 per cent of the shares held by the Agricultural Bank to the Social Security Fund, with a total value of over $11.5 billion.
According to the provisions, including the Social Security Foundation, as a financial investor, has the right to proceeds, disposal and the right to know the right to property of the State-owned equity ...
In its bulletin, the farm bank stated that this change in interest would not lead to changes in the stock shareholders and actual controllers in the bank.
In response, the author believes that the transfer of shares in similar State enterprises is not a simple change in equity attribution, but rather a "additional operation" that can stimulate a series of effects.
The first step of some State capital transfer to social security, "plus results" is naturally a reflection of the universal ownership of state-owned enterprises and development results.
After years of reform, State enterprises, especially in our economy, are mostly in important industries and areas, with a strong profitability and more stable overall profitability.
Of which, the lead company is more sustainable to do it.
On 10 July, the Standing Meeting of the State Council decided that this year the work of the transfer of some State-owned capital enrichment funds.
The Ministry of Finance then stated that it would be fully shared with the relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Meeting of the State Council, and that it would fully reflect the universal sharing of the results of the development of State-owned enterprises in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Meeting of the State Council.
The second step of the "plus result" is the basis for enhancing the sustainability of our social security fund and further building old-age social security systems.
With the ageing of the population, our social security funds are under pressure, and this time, as a State capital that has been transferred to the subject, mostly with continuous profitability and redization, not only effectively complements the social security fund, but also to provide active water for the Social Security Fund.
Measurements show that one percentage point is reduced by the share of basic pension insurance for enterprises per 3.8 percentage points.
The third step of the "plus result" is an increase stabilizer for capital markets.
This transfer of the main subject is to obtain the proceeds by "red is the main thing that works as a complement " .
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor in State capital, is indeed dominated by the gain of equity.
However, the Social Security Fund, as a value investor in capital markets, has a strong capital operational capacity.
For listed assets in State capital, the Social Security Fund will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which will help to improve the level of business operations and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund, as a leader in investment, has increased equity, which will help to further enhance its influence in the market and play a "stabilizer" role in the market.
In addition, it is conducive to the full use of the value discovery function of institutional investors, leading investors to invest rationally, value investments.

Choi Amin said that over 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens "go out" has increased dramatically, from less than a million a year before the reform and opening up to over a billion people today; at the same time, Chinese citizens travel abroad are more secure, and consular protection and assistance have also expanded from overseas Chinese nationals to Chinese nationals, tourists, students, workers, workers, etc.
According to statistics, since the 18th year of the party, we have organized more than 10 major operations to evacuate or transfer Chinese citizens abroad to safely evacuate more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
About 500,000 cases of assistance were received and coordinated, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
At dangerous times, the country can take you home; to have a "go-go trip," and it's no longer a dream.

China is currently the top of the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements and promote more visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, making diplomatic work more to the People's People's Initiative, constantly increasing the amount of gold ' of Chinese passports.

"One-to-one" two special high-pressure projects.
On 26th, the project on the high-pressure direct current transmission of the U.S. to 1100 kV, and the project of the Sutung 1000 kV exchange special high pressure GIL complex.
Both projects account for the current high ground in the respective areas of world transmission technology, and will bring our energy-wide optimization configuration significantly.
According to the General Economist of the National Energy Agency, Guo Ji-chul, the National Energy Agency, is the largest power transmission project in the world.
Its shipment is important to promote the development of Xinjiang energy bases and guarantee electricity supply in the East China region.
GIL, the gas insulation metal closed the transmission line.
The Suton Pipeline Project, which created the highest global voltage level of the GIL project, with the highest transmission capacity, has achieved the highest voltage level of the "interchange double-ring" ring of the East China backbone grid.
According to the National Electricity Network, the power transmission of the project to the south is 3324 km away.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15 per cent of electricity will be lost on the way, which has been developed and developed by a major increase in economic transmission distance to more than 3,000 kilometres.
100 million degrees of electricity can be delivered every 8 hours and 20 minutes after the launch of the project to enable the removal of new energy sources in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, the annual transmission of this line will reach 60 to 85 billion kilowatts, which will meet more than half of Shanghai's electricity use throughout the year.
The Suton GIL complex project is a controlled project across the Yangtze River.
If you use a regular air line across the river, two giant iron towers over 450 metres of the Yangtze River need to be built on the Yangtze River and build an artificial island of over four football fields for each tower.
In response, the national grid has boldly innovative and developed compact high-pressure exchange of GIL transmission techniques, avoiding the impact on gold lanes through tunnels.
Two projects have led to a new leap in the manufacturing capacity of electrician equipment.
At present, the national grid has accumulated the "10-to-one straight" special pressure project, and "4-to-three straight."

New regulations: Social capital needs to be qualified to acquire rural land operations
Social capital needs to be qualified to acquire rural land operations
The Rural Land Operating Right Transfer Management Scheme has publicly sought advice to regulate social capital flows such as business enterprises to access land operations rights.
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website issued a public consultation on the " Rural Land Operating Right Transfer Management Scheme (recommendation draft) " (hereinafter referred to as the " Opinion draft " ) to increase regulation and risk prevention of social capital flows such as business enterprises.
The "Views" are now open to society.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs stated that, in order to implement the newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act, further consolidate and improve the basic rural business system, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the "three-right separation" system, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the "Conversion of Rural Land Contracting Management" and a "view draft " .
The Beijing Youth Reporter learned that there were many important changes in the first release of the "Views".
The newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act identifies the range of land flows, following the concept of "three rights of ownership", with the special section establishing "land contracting rights" and "land operations rights " , which make a clear distinction between land contracting rights, swaps and land operations (rent, transfer, transfer, equity or other).
In this "view draft", in order to implement the concept of "three-power separation" and effectively respond to the thrust of the "Rural Land Contracting Act" and taking into account the exchange of land operations and the exchange of land contracting rights, transfers in parties, procedures, regulation, etc., which define the scope of flow, focusing on the flow of land operations, including rental, equity, etc., to amend the name of the regulations by the "Rural Land Contracting Authority" to the "Rover Management Scheme for Rural Land Operations " .
For the transfer of land contracting rights, swaps will be regulated separately.
The "view paper" states that in the context of the "three-right separation", farmers are only limited to land for a certain period of time.
In theory, even if the insolvency liquidation occurs, farmers have only the risk of losing their operational rights for a certain period, and therefore provides for the return of the original contractor to the original contractor is no longer legally necessary and in conflict with the "insolvency law".
In response to the problem of preventing the risk of land loss of farmers, priority units, post-rent shares, repurchases, etc.
Taking into account the more mature theoretical discussion of priority units in corporate law, it is recommended as an advocacy provision against the risk of land loss.
