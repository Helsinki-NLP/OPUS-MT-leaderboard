Is there a way to punish him?
So that's not what happens again.
Or how long will the restaurant be ready? Can you ask me?
The students sing the lead at the annual Zhejiang Academic Conference, and the results of the study are opening up.
The air washes, the mouth of the disease, the exact search for the source of the fog, was recognized last night at the opening of the 2016 academic conference of Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these results are students, and research covers major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, human education, and students have created many high-end inventions of applied value, some of which have been awarded internationally in the country.
Biosensor: Your family medical examination doctor
The Ph.D. at the Biomedicine Engineering Institute showed a biosensor at the end of a smartphone, only half the size of smartphones.
"You just need to take a light breath, and this device can be tested for initial health from the gas composition you're exaggered. "
Zhang Ding introduced that this sensor is connected to smartphones, and when the gas comes out, the health report will be on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health conditions in the market, generally detect physical parameters such as temperature, pulse.
And this biosensor uses the new graphite material, whose target is chemical elements, a sharp "sniff" that makes it deeper and accurately reflect physical health.
Smart surgery light: doctor's high-energy eyes
Besides smartphones, smart operating lights are used in the operating room.
This invention won the Silver Award at the 44th International Innovation Fair in Geneva, Switzerland.
The master's student at the Academy of Optical Sciences and Engineering, Chu Lin Jing, opened a new idea in the defects of the traditional operating light, invented smart LED surgery without a shadow light.
"Many early detection of diseases, which are not removed, related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room ... "
Shin Jun Fei said that, for example, when early cancer tests, doctors can't see all tumor tissues in time, then cancer cells spread.
This smart operating lamp has four lamps that enhance the difference between different tissues in the light by regulating the spectrum.
During the operation, doctors can regulate the size of the light, light, spectrometry, colour evenness and no-specific, depending on the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This smart operating lamp has been tested at the Zhejiang University Medical School Hospital, the Children's Hospital, the Zhejiang University Medical School Hospital, and has received better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize for the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water and cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, wipe soap, squeeze hands, and Li Kai-san and others invented a "air handwasher."
As long as the handwasher on the device, our weight will compress the air.
"It's like a flashlight.
Compressed air, forming fluids in the tap, combined with water.
So we can wash our hands!"
The colored reaction and bacterial residues have proven that the effect of washing hands through this method is the same as the usual handwashing method.
This device needs to be driven by our own gravity, which ensures the level of cleaning and saving 90% of the water, and the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Major Challenge Summit, the invention won the only gold prize in many of the world's top schools.

A certificate that feels meaningful -- first aid.
This is one of the skills I feel important than my driver's license!
Universal access: First aid is actually an emergency response at the time of an emergency, the rescue before the ambulance comes.
As you know, there was a while in the process of the ambulance coming after the accident, and that was the most important time.
This is when we need first aid.
If I really have a heart attack, a brain spill, a breath stop, then the window of our lives is only four minutes, four minutes of gold!
So people around you know how important first aid is!
When we fell around us, we could save him through professional knowledge, not just standing there without moving, and that helpless feeling is terrible.
"In China, our official data have 3 million people die unexpectedly every year, the most dangerous heart arrest.
It's an average of 15% in the United States that can be saved.
At the casino hotel in Las Vegas, 78 percent can be saved, Shanghai, Beijing is below 1%. "
That's what Lu Lok, the founder of the first reaction.
If a man has a heart attack, you're out of breath, your heart is gone, you're not gonna do anything.
It has to be artificial breathing, and it's possible to save people by pressing your chest.
I found that few people now have this consciousness to learn first aid, but when it happens, it's too late, so we're calling everyone to learn this skill so that we can react in time in the face of a sudden situation.
Maybe it'll save a man's life!
First aid certificates can be registered at your local Red Cross Training Centre. I'm registered at the Red Cross Training Centre in Pearl Sea, and students have a discount.
PS: The last picture is to record the goals you're going to do before he's 25 years old, and it was a few months ago, but it was done!
Then we're going to take another certificate, and I'm going to take a dive certificate, and I'm going to have a dive first aid certificate in the Red book, which seems to have an first aid certificate to go, so it's still useful!
I'm in order.
Of which, 13 bucks of shrimp dumplings!
Never tried.
What? Don't write it?
One for $13?
Yesterday, the food was leaked, and this time I had a shrimp dumpling!
Because it worked when I entered the code.
First, I personally think the Four Seas is a full-scale piece of shit, in every sense.
But you're gonna say this movie is not a bright spot, and that's not at least a good choice.
It's a lot of shit that allows you to sleep in the cinema, and it's a kind of thing that makes you look like a monkey on the Zephyr Mountain, which can light your anger in countless ways.
Han is a gift to insult the audience.
The most painful part of this film is that it's like it's made in a novel, inno name, and a lot of holes are like the windsuits on Little Marco.
Even after reading it, you'll wonder if there's a metaphor for the director, but when you think about it, it's actually a piece of shit.
Let's just say some of the stories I can't understand.
The male residence should be an island in the south and his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the play arranged a big man in the neighborhood to take her northeast to see the snow.
Old-age old man in a van from the south to northeast to see snow?
He and his father are very relieved about that.
And then the old man left the text.
How did the hostess get a license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why would the island's mini-car punk be relaxed and easy to seal a mountain road?
Then the truck with the steel band in the middle of the road was parked by the road, and the truck driver couldn't find it.
That's a very obvious feeling.
Why would a little bastard fly-in-law a policeman who can't be a policeman who can't believe it?
Why don't you call the police in the movies?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but I don't know how to open a room card in a hotel, and then you can't find a hotel owner, sit outside the room door and sleep?
This strange plot is full of the film, and it's painful because the plot is too crazy that I remember them.
Besides the plot, worse is the main theme of the film, or the film has no main thrust, and it's a hateful sewn.
You'll start thinking he wants to make a comedy film in over 20 minutes, guess it's probably an inspirational film, and you think it's probably a movie that's trying to show young people's survival, and you don't know what you're looking at, and then you're deeply suspicious of yourself, why they run to the cinema to enjoy shit.
Most people are actually very familiar with all kinds of movies, like you want to shoot a motorcycle player, then inspire + comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie is going to succeed.
If you want to make love movies, you're honest with the grudge between young and service girls who like to ride a motorcycle.
If you want to reflect reality, it's at least something that doesn't happen to the normal world.
Like Yoon's new motorcycle just burned and then singing, you can't open some brain holes that Kennedy can't even see.
As for the woman who's not weak, but in some ways, is like a 5-year-old, and I don't know why it's acting or the director's request.
And one thing I don't understand why Han-chun is so keen to add crash to his own movie?
Is this a movie that's scheduled for the spring class to make the audience more blocked?

Chongqing Middle School pilot modern apprentice system.
Yesterday, journalists learned from the City Council that, since this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprentice" talent development model in 60 middle schools, with students trained in pilot training, and that the admission will be pre-recorded by pilot enterprises as unit employees.
The Municipal Council requested that the admission to middle school admission and business labour procedures, clarify the dual identity of secondary school students and business members of apprentices, apprentices, schools and enterprises, in accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises, and that for apprentices, who are not 18 years of age, agreement must be signed by apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to identify specific posts and students trained on duty, teaching content, rights and interests, etc.
Pilot schools are encouraged to work together with cooperative enterprises in the form of modern apprentices.
Pilot schools need to reform talent development models.
School enterprises jointly design talent development programmes to develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, business master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
Pilots are based on training as a pilot cycle, and students ' internships in the enterprise are determined by a professional talent development programme, with a top-up internship for six months.
The enterprise practice should implement the corporate class management model, and, according to different professional characteristics, one teacher can bring 2-5 students to form a learning group to ensure that students are skilled in the skills required for each round of training.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, we have identified 60 modern apprentices in the city, with a total of about 50 students (intudents) per pilot, with a total of about 3,000 students (intudents).
In accordance with the principle of piloting, step forward from point to face, explore the establishment of joint enrolment, joint development, integrated child-rearing mechanisms, effective upgrading of student job skills and improving student employment rates and quality of employment.

It's worrying. It'll take long to finish.
Okay, please.
Is that the same rider for me?
Can I help you with me?
The restaurant says it's been cooking for over half an hour.
But no rider went to the store to take food.
South African doctor: Omikjun is strong, but it's mostly light.
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the disease caused by the new coronary virus Omikjun variant is lighter than Delta variants, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omikjun variant in South Africa, over 5,000 doctors in Holden Province, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of new coronary patients currently treated were mild, such as physical pain and coughing.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said he looked at dozens of patients every day, but no patient needs to be hospitalized.
Pile said: " They can control the disease at home, most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation ... "
He said it included elderly patients and patients with health problems, which were likely to be more likely to get seriously caused by coronary virus infections.
He said that, compared to the last wave of Delta outbreak, he treated "respiration difficulties, low blood oxygen levels."
Many people are hospitalized in a few days " .
Within two weeks of Southern Africa ' s first report on the Omikjong transgenic plant, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it takes weeks to collect sufficient data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30 per cent of the new coronary patients who were hospitalized in recent weeks were severe diseases, half of the previous wave of serious diseases; the average time of hospitalization decreased from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3 per cent of the recent new coronary patients died, compared to 20 per cent of early cases in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, Director of the African Health Institute, quoted data and other reports of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases: " Almost all the signs are currently indicating that this is a mild disease ... "
He also said, " It's still early, we need to get later data.
Usually, hospitalization and death occur late, and we only have two weeks to enter the epidemic ... "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effects of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's main new coronary virus plant, the case of Omikjun is emerging in dozens of countries, South Africa is the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December increased by 400 per cent, and the tests showed that the Omikjun variant accounted for over 90%.
Thank you for today's supporters. 80 boxes are out!

Education: What depends on saving abducted children?
If the famous public service ad for the analogy "no trade and no killing", then in a good environment without the need for "deportation", group protection, universal anti-trafficking, making trafficking unbelievable, high risk, high cost, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the emergency release platform for children ' s disappearance developed by the Department of Public Security Criminal Investigations Bureau was online.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish authoritative channels for information on disappearance of children and to recover abducted children in a timely manner.
I heard the App is called "Crowd." It's warm.
New technologies are not only called "art" but also full of information, practical, effective.
The primary objective of kidnapping law enforcement is to find abducted children, protect their physical safety, freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list a lot of "big words."
But before the trafficking case is broken, priority should be paid to the safety of the victim.
There is a matter of urgency, with urgent "help search" purposes, such as whether children should be killed, and more controversial topics can be held and discussed with caution; but the rescue of abducted children is not allowed.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, vendors are used to stay away from the place of the crime as soon as possible.
The search for a minute is delayed, and the child may be more away from parents, and the difficulty of solving the case increases.
In this case, it is practical to produce a direct way to solve cases and find a child's effective way.
After all, "abduction" is a big task that needs to operate the entire rule of law system.
Combating crime, guaranteeing the rights of children and parents, from legislation to judicial safeguards, and the secret of law enforcement, without need to follow up to the care of "weakness".
In addition, child trafficking prevention, from family to society, can do better.
For example, a common case, three rest at the train station, parents sleep and wake up and find the child missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should have at least quite protective awareness.
Both parents rest around or under sound protection are the minimum means of preventing child abduction.
From the other side of the police to combat trafficking, the purchase of abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
Individual wrongful acts are often just a ring in the long chain.
According to our Penal Code, the statutory sentence for the crime of trafficking in children is five years; particularly serious, the death penalty is punishable and confiscated property.
The crime of trafficking in children is clearly a crime of more punishment, under the trend of "light punishment".
But there are still a lot of trafficking cases every year.
As you can see, some people are backward in raising children and have a low legal awareness.
The rule of law of this part should follow up.
To control trafficking offences effectively, it cannot be strictly enforced by official law.
If the "market" is widespread, the traffickers are willing to innovate, to create a "go" situation with law enforcement, and the fight will be inefficient.
Therefore, breaking the concept of backwardness and universal access to legal common sense also helps to eradicate trafficking and buy child crimes.

Actually, I don't know if it's a shop or a rider's mistake.
There's no documents on the bag.
I can't track it.
I hope you understand.
Because the delivery time is 30 minutes faster than the show.
No, thank you.
Yes, I've changed a rider.
He's been waiting a long time.
The restaurant always said it was in the process.
I waited a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Association has divided olive oil into two categories of Virginia Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, five levels.
The first olive oil or natural olive oil is the oil that directly uses mechanical cold from fresh olive fruit, filtering, etc.
Depending on the degree of acid, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: The highest level of olive oil, the highest quality olive oil, is a pure natural product.
It's a great taste, a fragrance of plants with a light-like man, not more than 1% acid.
Fine Virgin: A slightly higher acid, but not more than 2%, pure, aromatic.
Normal primary olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): Tastes and spices are not more than 3.3%.
Refinery olive oil is olive oil obtained after acid exceeding 3.3% of the first olive oil, or become "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: Refinery olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of primary olive oil to adjust taste and colour, with a acid of less than 1.5%, transparent light yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: olive oil extracted from slag by dissolved method.
You should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olive fruit is like grapes that make wine, from different production areas, olive fruit from different olive fruit varieties, produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place for oil olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and temperature, sunlight, air humidity and precipitation.

The Democratic Summit is over, and Biden says the fire of freedom never goes out.
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by President Biden, attended by Governments of 110 countries around the world and civil society and private sector leaders, ended on Friday.
In his closing statement, Biden said that the fire of freedom burned in the hearts of everyone in the world, and the authoritarian regime could never put it out.
He also said that it was planned to convene the second Global Democratic Summit next year.
The representative of the Taiwan Government, the political council member Tang Feng and Hong Kong democratic human rights activists who are currently exiled in England, addressed the next day's summit.
Biden said, " We know how hard it is to work before us.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime will never put out the microfire of freedom, burning in the hearts of people around the world and around the world ... "
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires a common effort of society as a whole.
He said: " As the leader of the Government, we have a duty to listen to our citizens, strengthen democratic fences, promote reform, transparent accountability governance, and the power of the buffer and shock of dictatorship, and those who want to pursue power naked before public interest ... "
The next day of the Democratic Summit, the theme of the Democratic Summit was to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and confrontation against power, as well as against digital authority and the recognition of democratic values.
This day happens to International Human Rights Day.
In his opening statement of the United Nations Secretary-General Gutrez, the Secretary-General of the United Nations also stated that democracy faced challenges globally, particularly emerging digital technologies.
He said, " It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience ...
This requires deepening social dialogue, address inequality, combating corruption, updating social compacts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires determination to condemn all forms of populism, indigenousism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution ... "
Hong Kong democratic human rights activist, Luo Xing, spoke to the Summit through pre-recorded video remind participants of continuing attention to the human rights situation of Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and Uighur and Tibetans.
He said, " The world has long accepted the rise of China, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable ...
That's why politicians and civil society leaders have to cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority ... "
The government has also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party.
He said, " Perhaps some of you are afraid of pissing General Secretary Xi, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you have not realized the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
In the round table discussion on " Combating digital dictatorship, the recognition of democratic values", published a "State statement" by video, stressed that Taiwan was at the forefront of confrontation against dictatorship and power.
He also shared the experience of fighting the new coronary epidemic through transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: " As Taiwan’s democracy is not happy, we have been firmly at the forefront of the global confrontation against power and to play a leadership role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights ...
During the epidemic, local authorities rationalize human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy has shown signs of regression.
But in Taiwan, we don't have to seal the city to control the epidemic, and we can overcome false information without having to go down. "
Just along the next day of the Democratic Summit, the United States Treasury Department announced sanctions on 15 individuals, 10 entities, 10 entities identified in serious human rights violations, 10 entities, while implementing investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified to use surveillance techniques to assist human rights violations.
I've taken pictures and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time is delayed.
I'm gonna...
Anyway, I'm not screaming.
No, no.
I'll complain.
You can't send it. Why don't you tell me earlier?
Waiting for you so long.
No, I didn't get it. Call.
Please inform him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait any more minutes.
One meal for an hour and a half.
*PRS_ORG's not sent
I want to cancel the order.
Why don't you cancel it?
Hello. The saliva chicken from the restaurant is born.
I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid I couldn't hold on, so I wanted to find a similar price practice.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices are often compared to friendship, and if it's not clear, then the normal situation is cheaper than a cheap shot, and this kind of "entry" is actually industrial trash.
They're low, they're on the beat, they're very vibrating, hardballs, they're hard to handle.
The logic and subtext of their existence are -- tennis is so hard to learn, you know you can't learn, you know you don't want to buy expensive, you can't fuck you, you can't play twice, you won't fight again, so this beat is cheap, and you don't hurt.
When you can really tell the good or bad, it means you're getting better. I'll come back here and buy it. I'll make twice.
It's recommended that it cost a similar price, buy a better second-hand bat, choose prince, or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good bats are not sold at a price, 500,600 is good, and a second-hand 200 is good, and a thousand dollars is not good?
It's nice to the new guy, but it's a chicken rib after the new hand, but most people, especially girls, can't get through the new hand phase.
Orders have been delayed by delivery several times
Can I help you with me?
Delayed
Thank you.
So, I've got a credit?
Do I need to re-order next?
Hello, I ordered food in this restaurant, but there's a lot of food that's missing, and the saliva chickens are born.

I'm asking for delivery. I'm not taking it at all.

The girl raised money for her sister as an arrow target: "It's okay to think of a skin wound."
A girl standing in front of a big board in Hangzhou, writing the word "human meat target, ten dollars and one arrow".
Yesterday morning, a picture of "Hhangzhou Girl Gandang" raised money for my sister.
Photos show that a girl in Wulin Square in Hangzhou is standing in front of a small board, with the woodboard with the word "human meat target, ten dollars and one arrow" and can be shot with bows and arrows after paying.
The act triggered a fan of the Internet.
Last night, the head of the Department of the Lower City Branch of Hangzhou City confirmed to journalists in the New Kyoto newspaper that the girl had confirmed that the girl had made such an exciting move for her sister, but it was not worth advocating, and after the warning, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl's street arrow target raised the defendant's commandment.
In a picture of the Internet, a long-haired girl stood in front of a large board, and the woodboard wrote the word "human meat target, ten dollars a arrow" on her other plate, and she wrote on her bank account and micro-mail, pay the treasure account, etc.
The picture is controversial after the Internet.
Some netizens believe that this is "the begging of the eyeball" and that a lot of netizens have sympathy.
"We found out when we patroled the square around 10 a.m. on 23rd, when there were a lot of viewers. "
In an interview with the local media, the police station near the scene, said that there were two girls who were around 20 years old and dressed up.
Among them, the girl who's been crying, asking for the roadman to play this game; the other girl helped drink, saying that his friend's sister had leukemia, and now needs surgery, and please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou that the girl was raising money for the leukaemia treatment ... "
Last night, the head of the Department of the City Branch of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau told the New Kyoto newspaper that the girl was named Gigari, who raised a fund for her sister Giga-Ying.
But this was done because it still took over 300,000 costs, and it was not possible to raise a good way to raise money.
He said that in the process, two girls were targeted, one in charge of fighting, but not involved, and no arrows were found in the process, but just someone looked around and took pictures on Twitter.
The police were identified by the security department, and the bows used were not regulated.
The head said that " no such eye-raising approach is promoted " .
After warning from the police station, she left the police station.
Heat dispersion: good, light: convenient, appearance material: satisfaction, macros have been very expensive.
The new machine is very good.
It's stable. Four wind vents are fine. It's worth recommending.
This grand Shadow Knight Dragon is a good game. It's a good job.
The price of the Dragon of the Dark Shadow is still expensive.
Personally, the Dark Shadow Knight Dragon is really good, the game works: the game is smooth, I can play most games, and I eat chickens are stable, very fluid, Lol is not talking, and CSgo is easy, and most threea games can play.
Heat spread: The heat is good, the fans are good, the work is quiet, the game is open.
Appearance material: It's cool, the game's wind, the effect: the screen is clear, the game is enough.
It's really good to buy a notebook, it's mostly designed, it's very expensive, it's more expensive than you think, and it's better than you think, red on your ass is a very good color, not so popular, and it's a lot more expensive than expected, and girls are good at buying.
Two years ago, it took two years to get into contact with the King Night Knight, and it took two years to have a higher value and a hard quality!
I recommend them to buy this product!
We've bought this series of three machines!
It looks beautiful and it's a good configuration.
I bought it for his nephew, and he was waiting for 418 bank activities, and he bought it early, so he didn't catch up with the bank.
But it's worth a lot of money, and logistics is fast.
A new original, a game laptop with a super-priced game. It's a good design style that's already installed Windows 11 and office 2019.
Show effect: Buy a child for 3D rendering, software, and kids say they can use it, and this computer can do 3D design performance.
Buy it to his son, he said it was good.
Computers are good, especially the customer service is good. Just don't understand.
Not bad. The color of the game is real.
What's the hottest thing in 2021?
It's certainly the Tokyo Olympics.
You think only Olympic Ken can get the prize?
The article "Look! The project manager can hit the gold medal Olympic project" was hot, which mentioned that project managers could definitely be a horse in many projects, no one can be a horse first, and no one can wear: move bricks, travel, stay up all night for the project manager's day, fire, back pot, apologize.
An article that seems to be a joke, but it also tells the daily bitterness of the project managers, which represents the lack of effort to the current project management.
And the project management workers are gradually choosing to get themselves out of their work through some actions.
From the number of registered PMPs (international certified project management professionals) each year, more and more project management practitioners have improved their project management capacity through learning.
According to the China Project Management Development Report (1999-2019), by September 2019, the cumulative number of PMPs has been awarded nearly 600,000 in the country, with approximately 420,000 certified by PMP, with an effective holder of about 300,000, or 31.2 per cent of the global PMP.
The number of PMP certificates has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that the past "old experience" is no longer desirable, and a rapidly changing working environment allows us to know a path to learn to stand on the shoulders of the scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, will PMP be able to ensure that project management is unstoppable?
Many project management beginners have indicated that through learning relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, knowledge points such as 10 areas and five process groups of project management can be systematically mastered, but it was still a fog in the time of real project management.
Many project managers often provide feedback on the following issues: Project management awareness, simply relying on personal experience, empty project management theory, unknown how to practice; Lack of system-based project management process system, unable to land in work, project estimates, poor control sensitivity, project drags; members are not clear, the "old oil bars" in the team do not know how to respond to cross-sectoral assistance in communication, and the project is difficult to advance ...
As a result, more than a dozen areas of product innovation and research and development management have helped a large number of good businesses to develop a large number of key talent for product managers, project managers, etc., and has received the award of the Chinese Tianhuaxia consultancy with the "R & D Project Manager" online course.
The online course of the R & D Project Manager's special training camp is a way of cutting on-line fragmentation, combining field cases, tools and methods for many R & D enterprises to help you master the knowledge and standard actions that project managers need to develop their own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less inputs to promote the development process of project managers, providing efficient operational results to businesses.
It's not a good idea to see how other participants evaluate the course: this course is not only a team of experts in China-Tianhua (formerly the China-China Research and Development Management Team), which combines the advanced international project management methodology and the real business scene of many well-known enterprises, to provide shallow professional lectures on the content of the course.
And it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, a rich template form that helps participants to convert the content of learning to specific jobs after the course.
There's only one shrimp dumpling order?

At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should be selected and careful whether the relevant institutions have operational qualifications.
In the future, the short letter will continue to bring more demand-friendly and diversified services to consumers, with its mature, reliable consumer financial system and continuous renewal of the iterative financial products, and to help consumers develop rational consumption, modest lending, consumer-trusted consumer financial partners.

Viet Nam People ' s News Network - Gulf Cooperation Commission to address common challenges
The stay of Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (United Arab Emirates), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this has been the first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis, Crown Prince Mohammed.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and carried out a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, while closely related to Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have had a serious impact on the economic impact of the United Arab Emirates' internal solidarity and had a negative impact on the economy of the region.
Four Arab States have blocked the land and sea route to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January 2021, and the Gulf States signed an agreement on the movement of the United States and Kuwait to "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are appointing a new ambassador in Qatar through both countries to restore relations with Qatar.
The Arab States of the Gulf to resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar from their interests and regional stability must be united to meet common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two adjacent States of the Gulf.
The 725-km-long passage of the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of supply chains for both citizens.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman and 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince ' s visit to the Gulf States coincided with the negotiations between Iran and the world on the Iranian nuclear agreement called the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA) — an agreement condemned by the Arab States of the Gulf because it was unable to resolve the problem of Iranian missiles.
The Gulf countries have always considered Iran as a long-term "combator" and saw Iran's nuclear plan as a threat to regional security.
The Gulf States believe that it is flawed to prevent Iran ' s activities in the region without addressing Iran ' s missile problems.
In the context of the failure of major countries and Iran to meet the wishes of the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia and Iran have made direct negotiations with Iran.
The goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors in reducing economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The forthcoming summit will be the first summit of the United States since the end of the dispute between some member States and Qatar.
This is the opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Commission to re-evaluate diplomatic results to contribute to the restoration of the reunification of the United States, while proposing measures to fully cooperate its member States to meet common challenges and contribute to stability and development in the Gulf States.

The new mountain is the most popular.
This time our team brought this car to you is a dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship superrun, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP 700-4!
It's worth nearly two million dollars, a year's tax horse, four-wheel drive. Why LP 700?
Can you imagine how fast it is to have 700 horsepower?
That's not clear. The data says it's only 2.9 seconds to speed up, and it's probably 100 km/h when the editor's Myvi is 30 km/h, huh.
The short body, the arrogant scissors door, the huge vent around the car and the endless 6.5 v12 engine under the glass, perfect interpretation of Lamborghini's style.
I don't need to say too much about the car. Just Google.
It's too much to be seen. Everyone's looking at it. It's uncomfortable!
1 km oil is around RM1.
You'll have to practice in the position of getting off the car, or it'll be a little awkward.
The engine is too loud, and it'll be deaf when you get out.
It's too big, it's narrow in the regular parking space, and I'm afraid of being knocked on when the next car opens!
It's a little lonely because there's no opponent on the road.
Don't get me wrong. The video's running is not for sale. Sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car, welcome to contact us!

It's a million-dollar accident!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that Chiron is one of the most expensive super-runs in the world, and Porsche 911 is a million-dollar price!
That day, the country hit a million cars in a few minutes, 911 and millions of overruns, Chiron!
Look at the results, it makes sense!

Starting with the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have a unique mission different from other social organizations, and for our universities, the autumn of national distress, and its spirit is influenced by traditional culture and time changes, advocating the value concept of "Ming Deji, Shujiping" and patriotism of the "Hing Power".
Currently, higher education information, internationalization is becoming increasingly evident, global competition for education, science and technology, talent competition, and higher education as an important " supply side " , and structural reforms face unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the Integrated World-class University and the Master of First Class Studies Building Programme, shows our confidence and determination from the major countries of higher education to the strong countries of higher education, and the demands of higher renewal of university development.
How can we work to get into the world in a short time, accelerating the construction of several world-class universities and a group of world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines in a short time to achieve the "Bending Supercar"?
In addition to the firm goal of confidence, path confidence, capacity and confidence, higher education should fully realize three advantages: one is the post-emergence advantage, learning to learn to achieve a significant improvement in academic and quality through the advanced experience of world-class universities; second is cultural advantage, inheriting the intellectual content of Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, to promote the development of a good traditional culture, to build brands and enhance image; and three are institutional advantages, to enhance the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen goals, build consensus, optimize resource allocation, and provide sustainable and solid safeguards for schools to accelerate the super-world advanced levels.
In particular, it is important to realize that building a world-class university cannot be on the side of thousands of schools, and that schools must highlight their personality and characteristics while taking advantage.
The special features of the study are both a common Chinese character and a unique target positioning, teaching tradition and resource delivery.
In the case of Zhejiang University, we focus on three main features in our studies: first, to highlight the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurship, building the integration of science and education, integrated the human environment, the formation of a whole chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystems; second, highlighting the cross-section of the discipline system, promoting the optimization of the discipline system, creating a cross-cutting institutional environment, actively nurtured cross-cutting cross-cutting and landmark cross-cutting outcomes; and third is highlighting the characteristics of the school system and social services, to accelerate the formation of a system of cooperation in Pan-Zhei.
In the process, it is particularly important to keep the university spirit and resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, "Innovation" school training, "working, Shud, clear, solid" common values and the "Heiner River, the Shina River, the former people, the tree kingdom" together constitute the latest system of expression of Zhe's spirit.
This is the important guarantee of the school's commitment to the right direction, building up the height of culture and cohesion, which is rich and far-reaching.
Among them, the Heiner River emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, as reflected in the heart of "the world's talent for the world" as a high-quality idea of learning in the world; "The Great Goodness" emphasizes the true and good spirit, which refers to universities, while pursuing truth, more like the pottery and personality of German deeds; "The people of the beginning of the world" are reflected in the spirit of reform innovation, both knowledge, innovation in scientific research and development, and so it is new; and " Tree My State" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism, speaking that universities should always be humiliated with the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and values is the soul of Zhejiang University in 120 years.
"The wise listens silent, and the clear ones are invisible " .
Chinese higher education institutions are further based on the Chinese-specific socialist career, and is deeply aware of the historical mission of the era and the historical mission of higher education, accelerating the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, the spirit of university spirit and the spirit of the era, the spirit of the nation, the spirit of the nation, thus providing the power of the nation's wealth and national revitalization and to achieve the common ideals of humanity.

Seeing a news story about friends' stock prices, my greatest feeling is the choice of a business in the track, which means the choice of the industry in the investment standard, first to choose the size of the market that grows in space, at least 100 billion in the market size; and then, to choose the future of good-growing industries, consider the best growth of the industry in the next three to five to five years; and finally, you have to choose a policy-supported industry.
How wide the track refers to market size, how long the track is the development phase of the industry, whether the track is flat or rough is the competition pattern of the industry.
Let's go for the right track!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactics are "do the things right," which is the right thing.
And the strategy is "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is direction, tactics are landing, and there's room for strategic thinking on most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) can be thought about how to continue deepening or horizontal areas in the current field (strategic thinking); for example, raising customer retention rates (tactical thinking) can be thought about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on increasing activity participation (tactical thinking), consideration can be considered how to set up the right activity KPI to achieve the right activity objectives, such as raising target customer participation, activate high-value silencers, precision and pull new; to consider whether current growth is healthy and sustainable.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the house broker that a factory in the town of Yao Yao, Zhejiang Yu, decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu made a deposit of $200,000 on the details of the purchase of the plant and the family of the owner of the house owner, which was transferred by the bank.
Lin was signed as a payee on the "Standing of the Factory" and "If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit is to the seller, if the seller is reluctant to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned twice as the seller, and the parties agreed to sign a contract for the sale of the plant within a week. "
However, the parties subsequently failed to agree on the main contract terms such as the sale of the plant, the payment modalities, resulting in a delay in the contract for the sale of the house ...
Given that the parties failed to reach consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the $200,000 deposit to Mr. Lu.
It's hard to look at the house, the deposit is ready, the house is ready to sign the contract, and the seller won't sell it, which makes Mr. Lu angry.
To that end, Mr. Lu has prosecuted Lin to Yu Yao City People's Court.
The Court held that the parties had ultimately failed to enter into a formal contract and could not be attributed to the accused and should be reasonably presumed as a consultation, so the case should not apply the law, and the accused would not have to assume double liability for the return of the deposit.
After the trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the Court of Second Instance maintained the sentence.
[Lawyer reminds] Be careful with the necessary due diligence in the course of the transaction.
In the signing of a contract, the buyer is required to take due diligence to the necessary obligation, for example, verification of information on the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and to clarify the specific time, place of delivery in order to prevent dispute between the parties in the performance of the contract.
After Friday, the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a speech on Saturday (11 December) that the United States organized the " Leaders Democratic Summit " , which "initiated the democratic tool, weaponization, weaponization, false democracy, in the name of democracy, incitement to division and transfer domestic contradictions " .
The Chinese Government believes that " for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value philosophy on people, promoting " democratic transformation ' , to indiscriminating unilateral sanctions and the "colour revolution ' , with catastrophic consequences.
Democracy has long become the "weapon of mass destruction" of the United States interference in other countries.
The summit was a campaign by Biden to fulfill his campaign commitments.
Two-day meetings were conducted on video, with 111 leaders worldwide invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States on the eve of its own democracy, claiming that the United States was not eligible to host such a summit.
There are also questions in the international and United States, such as criticism of invited leaders, such as leaders of powerful dictatorships, such as the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some doubt that the true intentions of the Biden government are not organizing the summit for democratic purposes for geopolitical purposes.
The new German Prime Minister Scholtz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday stated that " today's American democracy is manifest, money politics, identity politics, political parties, political opposition, political extremeization, social torn, racial contradictions, rich and poor " , and that democracy in the United States is a "rich game based on capital."
In his statement, President Biden stated that " as the leader of the Government, we have a duty to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, transparent accountability governance, and the power of the buffer and shock of dictatorship, and those who want to pursue power naked before public interest ... "
He stressed that democracy was not for course, " We must constantly update it among every generation, and in my opinion, this is a decisive challenge of our time ... "
Biden also said that democracy and human rights "in the face of sustained and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend."
The United States has committed itself that a one-year action will be launched after this democratic summit, including an $424 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States wants countries to make specific public commitments before the real democracy summit planned at the end of 2022 to improve its democratic system.
Biden said, " Let all our countries implement our commitments and report on our progress next year " .
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.

Educational thinking: how the university exam makes the "student" "Scum" with its own -- Xinhua Network.
Three students from the University of Transport, Lanzhou, wrote to the school leader, reflecting confusion about the university examination and proposed the difficulty of the examination, changing the examination to make the examination really reflect the actual level of the student's claim.
Indeed, for a long time, college exams are a hot topic.
On university campuses, students come from the four seas of five lakes, with different levels of capacity, with different levels of learning, and learning is different.
The examination of groups with such a diverse identity, there is a different feeling, and it is inevitable.
Of course, if the test is single, high repetition rate, too simple, it's bound to create another very different feeling.
Students who don't have to work, they may pass the pre-test assault, and if you think of another way, it's possible to do it twice as much as possible.
So, there's a "scum" that doesn't usually get through, even high points; "schooler" never falls, homework, notes, and the exam is not much high.
So, Lanzhou's senior students reflect the problems in the university exam, and believe that this situation is not just in Lanzhou.
In that sense, I'm gonna give you a compliment to the three students who write straight.
In fact, people who went to college know that the assault test was to "set" from the teacher's office, to get the scope of the examination, and it's not surprising to get a "focus tutor" before the exam, even with a little copy in the exam, and it's not surprising to ask for a teacher to raise his hand.
In the view of the author, as a quality assessment orientation of teaching, measuring the eligibility of a university examination is more about teachers' full understanding of teaching and learning, and scientific propositions based on this basis.
In the undergraduate phase of the university, the profession begins to be broken down, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt whether to have a full knowledge of a discipline is the content of the university examination.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically basic theory and basic common sense, and from the knowledge point, the space of change is not very large, basically fixed.
As teachers say, " Basic knowledge of mathematics at university 20 years ago, is still learning, or focus ... "
But the knowledge point is largely unchanged, not the single test type, the question is repeated.
In many universities, examinations usually form a group of topics, and then a joint group of senior teachers in the subject, and the examination papers are also involved in all teachers of the Section, so that the repetition of the test can be overcome to some extent.
But a set of subjects that are consistent with the practical teaching and learning, subject to the overall study of students, is difficult to be distributed properly, and a comprehensive analysis of the level of student learning, thus making the examination difficult, dynamic, both highlighting basic knowledge and capacity-checking, and innovative design of the subject.
The exam is the command stick for university education, and what kind of examination is, and students will have the corresponding preparatory programme, which will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The students' advice letter, Lanzhou has given high priority to the school and has deployed a modified programme throughout the school.
The teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and courses to conduct self-censorships, development of examination papers and related systems, while strengthening the monitoring and inspection of examination papers and audit sessions, detailed results and strengthening the comprehensive appraisal of the curriculum.
The problem of addressing the single type of test issues in the mechanism is the subject of the subject that the university examination needs to be faced, of course, but kung fu is expensive, requires a comprehensive knowledge of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but to eat the student's learning, and teaching and learning will be better connected, and the examination will be more realistic, so that the "student" and "slag" will be more realistic.

48 hours of nucleic acid negative, with a "buffer zone" and the State Council Joint Defense Mechanism sent a message calling for strengthening the control of the epidemic in the port city - Xinhua Network
Xinhua, Beijing, 11 December, the State Council Defence Mechanism issued a circular on strengthening the control of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring recent departure from the land border port city (except those connected to Hong Kong, Macao) to hold 48 hours of negative certificate of nuclear acid detection and at least one nuclear acid detection after the arrival of urban personnel at the land border.
According to the notification, the time frame for the above requirements is to determine the scope of the port city from the provinces and municipalities, until 15 March 2022.
In addition, the notice suggests that conditional port cities can study the establishment of an epidemic-controlled buffer zone in the jurisdiction.
The head of the National Health and Health Commission on Disease Prevention and Control introduced that cross-border border trade is the main local economic pillar for some port cities, with frequent transactions between the two sides.
The introduction of a divisional differential management policy, which is transformed from a control spill line to two lines, is expected to achieve a front-of-the-clock shift, compressing the risk of epidemic spills, with minimal social impact and maximum social costs to achieve the greatest effectiveness of epidemic control.
Recently, there have been a number of local concentration epidemics in the country, which are entered through port cities.
The above-mentioned notification states that this exposes some local epidemic monitoring warning in time, non-implement management of high-risk post personnel, regular nucleic acid detection flows to form, and that cold chain items are not in place, and that there are insufficient management of quarantine sites, and that the emergency treatment of the epidemic is not sufficiently scientificly accurate.
The notification requires that nine aspects of the improvement of the prevention and control of the epidemic in the port city, the sound of the early warning system for epidemic monitoring, the implementation of border control measures, to accelerate the weakness of the short-board control of the city at the port, without relaxing, scientific precision, and the protection of the security line.
The circular emphasizes that cities at all sides need to synchronize the epidemic control with the human life security work, the simultaneous deployment, publish and access to the public life security hotline, regularly check the seed risks of basic living supplies, prices, etc., and to address and respond to prominent issues reflected by the public in a timely manner.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include open land roads, water roads, air ports in the county (city, district, flag), city (land, state, alliance) and municipalities directly under the jurisdiction, which are determined and announced in accordance with the needs of epidemic control.

The pipeline video started 20 years of bloodthirsty killing the truth - Xinhua Network
(Video source: pipeline)
On December 11, a microdocument of the pipeline platform called "The Killing Machine" was a widespread concern.
The film describes the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forced the export of American democracy through war, 20 years of poor soldiers, bloodthirsty, killing innocent people and commit anti-human crimes.
Abuse of drone air strikes hospitals, schools, etc., distortion of humanity and establishment of homicide teams.
For 20 years, the U.S. Army has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. Army has set up a "black prison" to torture the suspect, and he's humiliated.
A crime against humanity has provoked more Afghan hatred.
As the video says, the more anti-terrorism war in the United States is more afraid.
The war did not bring the Afghan people to peace and democracy, hope for prosperity, and only the country and countless killings.
Put the video together to expose the truth about the bloodthirsty killing of the United States in the name of "terrorism" and the false face of American democracy!
I didn't mean to see the following article, from a commercial perspective and a period of preservation, why the client wants to do the tank in the tax zone, although cans are deep-processed, not within the scope of the insurance logistics company, which may explain why the client wants to do so?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers, and I went to a lot of milk powder production lines.
Actually, the bags are exactly the same as the milk powder they're wearing, and there's no difference.
Then you will certainly ask: Why is the bag warranty period a year, and the hearing is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is the price of listening to the bag so much?
In fact, many consumers, or mother-class, think it's a lot better because raw materials are different.
It's like raw materials. It's just that people think it's good.
There are consumers who react after eating this mentality and say that the taste or taste of the hearing is different!
Now I'll start with you why you're listening to the expensive.
Why are their raw materials so different?
Because most of the manufacturers at pricing, considering that if the bag is too high, consumers are difficult to accept, which means that the manufacturer produces low profits, or without profit, what does the manufacturer survive?
So they have a big increase in the price of the hearing suit to guarantee their profit space.
So most manufacturers push listens, not bags.
And you think so many manufacturers cost tens of millions or billions of dollars a year. What's the cost?
You know what you want.
So as society develops, market outreach costs, such as market promotions, mall display costs, product grants, advertising costs, etc., are increasing.
So the manufacturers are increasing new products, and they're listening, and the prices are rising, but it's a new product with market costs.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, but their raw materials will not cost up to $3,4.
There are also some brands that, to promote their products, whatever they can, to connect to hospital doctors, to assist in the promotion of the product, from 30 to $80 in the hearing.
China's laws are absolutely not allowed to operate, and it's actually a trap for consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder in the cans, which will save costs, while increasing the preservation and sealing of milk powder and no impact on children.
And don't think that the quality of the hearing is longer than the bag, and if you listen to the same quality period after the bag is opened, it's just that it's not easy to save after the bag is opened.
The food is late, the food is cold, it's dry and hard.
And the soup was spilled.
Cancel immediately. He must be cold.
I never took it!
Say you're not going to get it.
We called.
If you don't refund, I'll call the police.
I've been using a lot of times, and this is the worst experience today.
It's totally unacceptable.
Okay, okay.
But also remind the restaurant and the rider.
Avoid next time.
I want to know exactly the time of delivery.
That time was delayed.
I don't know when to wait.
If you cancel the order, can you return the money?
How can I pay the rider's service?
A rider was confirmed over an hour ago.
I don't want to wait anymore.
Don't scare people at the start line.
When you go to the book market, you can feel the fire of successful books.
Many of the successful books today are "best principles" -- assuming or imply that you can "do" and then tell you what you need to do.
It's like saying, "How to do it" is the most important, fundamental link.
And that's why these books have a common feature -- either just do the best or just do nothing; or 100, or zero; or you're going to Tarzan or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" that makes anyone think of "right," but 99% of the people are scared before the start line.
Because this theory is a path of "you have to be determined, re-emerging, a 180-degree shift," which is exactly the deadly weakness of many.
For those who keep the rules, who follow the old, refuse to change, you're going to shout "You're going to change" in his ear, and you're definitely lying to the bull.
Most people will be afraid in front of the word "change" and will not be determined; or with a moment of impulse, "change" and bravely take the first step, but often it's not long, and it's not going to last, and it's hard to lose for a while, and it's hard to see continuity.
Mr. Malli's famous "starting tomorrow" is the most sacred classic of "general humanity".
The biggest problem with the best principle is that the threshold is too high, and it often goes beyond the limits of ordinary people, making the vast majority of people look at the door.
Maybe, the principle of the second is a way to get more ordinary people on a relatively successful path.
The core of the Second Principles is "low the threshold" – it encourages a theory of "small wins" that only one if it can't be 100: because one is always greater than zero; if you don't get to Tarzan, it's just a little sand dunes at your door, because it's always better than it is.
Anyway, as long as you do something, you're better than not.
Because the threshold is significantly reduced, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to insist, and the probability of success will increase if you insist.
It's just the path to success of the Second Principles, and it's just a little longer.
In short, the "best principle" , although it is a flag that makes everyone succeed, it eventually inspires, actually a few; and the "sub-prison principle" can effectively inspire more people and benefit as much as possible.
So, do I need to reorder now?
No phone.
I'm not delaying.

Qinghai Lake Naked Wall Resources have increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Network
On December 11, Xining, journalists from the Agricultural Rural Department of Qinghai Province, learned from the Qinghai Province Agricultural Rural Office that the latest monitoring results show that Qinghai Lake Naked Wall resources increased by 0.71 million tons over the previous year, reaching 10.8 million tons, an cumulative increase of over 40 times compared to the early days of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake's naked carp, a precious species of fish in Qinghai Lake, has a significant role in the safety and biodiversity of the conservation and biodiversity of the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, factors affected by the growing degradation of the environment in the waters of naked walls, the number of naked walls in Qinghai Lake was reduced, with only 2592 tons of resources in the Blue Sea Lake Naked Wall in 2002.
In 2004, the naked wall of Qinghai Lake was classified as endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has been using a lake-covered fish, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual to the main rivers and streams of Qinghai Lake and Lake, which prohibits the sale of naked walls and their products.
Meanwhile, measures such as the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passage" have continued to increase protection through artificial proliferation and clean up the Qinghai Lake ' s main entry into the lake river lanes.
According to Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agricultural Rural Department of Qinghai Province, the Naked Wall of Lake Qinghai has been cumulatively implemented with nearly 180 million tails, with a contribution of over 23% to the recovery of naked wall resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Qinghai Three Rivers are important ecological barriers and water-based areas in our country and Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification east of the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment in the Sanjiang and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife and maintain biodiversity in the Qingxi Plateau, and since this year, Qinghai has released a circular on the Yangtze, Yellow River, Qinghai Lake priority waters, and has built a comprehensive ban management system for the "A River One River One Lake".

Only one bag for me in the restaurant. It's cold.
I'd like to ask you, is the takeout in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
Want to know if it's leaking, or we're someone taking it, thanks.
It's been an hour. It's not even delivered yet.
I just saw a fake article. It's too long.
Give the male Cope I don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first routine leave one day during the age of 13-15, closed around 50.
Then you'll be more regular once a month if you're healthy.
But it's not a regular prediction, but about a week's bus, it needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes the luck difference goes over.
The length of time, blood, pain varies from people, some people for three days, some for a week; some people are bleeding; some have no reaction, some people don't react, some hurt to ambulances, and pain changes over time, and it doesn't hurt forever.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours in a few days until the end, only with sanitary towels or tampons to prevent the flow of the clothes chair.
The pain is mainly because of prostate, and the time of the physiology is that the time to eat Broven effectively to ease the pain of the month, and it's no use eating after the beginning of the pain.
Before the biological period, it was too high to release the womb and prostate, and it was easy to get a stomach.
If it's about the cycle, it's a little bit of a tummy, basically a period of menstruation in two days.
The sanitary towels should be replaced in two or three hours, or it's easy to feed bacteria, and the worst is to replace six times a day, seven days a month, 42 pieces, and if you add the advance, it may not be one per month.
(Reform here, the tampons don't have to change, about five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Menstruation may be more restless, and the ovulation period will also be unstable because of the instability in the body, and it's bad for the body to make a trip.
But official crime rate data can see that women have a high ability to control emotions, and they don't make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood, it contains a broken womb.
The end of the menstruation is thinest, and then slowly thicker, as the womb is a house, and every month the house is ready to meet the guests, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests are not coming, and the guests didn't come, and the guests didn't come, and the guests didn't come, and then.
Menstruation is not convenient, decades in a row, bleeding 24 hours a month, and a stomach pain. Who wants it?
But a man was born because his mother had a period, and the menstruation was to prepare for your first time in the world, and you would like to thank her mother for his regular health.
A lot of women used to be crushed, society brainwashed women as dirty, shameful, and people thought it was like that, but the times changed.
If anyone feels sick of menstruation and feeling that the woman's body is sick of preparing for life, it should not be said in the public, the girls stand up, stop thinking, never experience it, and the men who don't know much, don't be so ungrateful, how can you be so mean to face their mothers?
Finally, the sisters try the tampons. It's really working.
It's winter to holiday. It's a disappointment to get wrong.
I'm gonna order another meal for the kids.
I hope the shop is busy to check the product.
Did the bath bubble hair leak?
The choice of the right bath can play a good foot therapy, and today's editor of the country will answer this question and hope to help friends.
As people's health awareness increases, the bath is increasingly popular with consumers, and a large number of different products are emerging in the market, ranging from a hundred to thousands of dollars of foot baths, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the relevant data surface, health-care household electricity such as traditional household electricity is hot, but the foot tub does not have a special industry standard, and there is a certain security hazard.
"It's too dangerous to bubble your feet in the water with electricity!"
Mr. Lee told the press that recently he bought a bath for his father for his father, but his father felt so numb when he broke his feet.
Mr. Lee initially thought it was a vibration function of the bath, and he didn't think it was a vibration function, and his father felt a numb.
Mr. Lee tried with a pen, and the pen was lit, and Mr. Lee was surprised to find out that the water in the bath was carrying electricity.
He contacted the merchants, and the merchants were doing well, and Mr. Lee was still upset, despite the drop of the bath.
Because he found that this already popular bath is now at the highest temperature set, which is applicable to what population, and there is no clear and detailed industry regulation.
But in general, the bath is not subject to electricity, but it does not rule out a few products that are not strictly closed when they leave the factory.
So, when you buy it, you choose the split bath.
Water and electricity separation, no security risks.
And you can take the pen.

The sheep's twilight, born in the sheep's moon, the sheep's grass, is suitable for sheep's grass, and it's called Uncle Sheep.
Because of the publication of the "Thai Alien" series of "The Inhuman Code" series, "India's Insight" "Japan's Insight" and "Korish" in the industry, calling himself "good at a regular nonsense."

"Suspicious" sheep have white hair and accumulated millions of best-selling books!
The original Chinese alien, the new work after the foreign code, the same author, the same lead, continuing the story of the "Thai Insight" "India"!
That's less. You need money for a McLea chicken sauce.
You asked the restaurant to bring it up.
I just don't want to go downstairs to buy something to pay for takeout.
Ting Ziu: To friends.
I am grateful to your friends for the humanitarian assistance that has been given to over 30 years after our family's murder, especially since I had sent humanitarian assistance to friends in the country and abroad in early 1994.
Most of the parents of the victims are now grateful and the dead have grown up to work.
It's the most difficult time you've ever had for our families.
The new coronary epidemic is currently raging globally, and most donors have retired annually.
So I sincerely ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation of the mother of Tiananmen, which should have been perfect.
I will always remember your love and believe that your deeds will be remembered for history.
For all reasons, I can only express my will in this way. Please understand!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
The pottery press: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the history of 32 years of humanitarian assistance by the IFCS and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the course of humanitarian assistance, the National Science and Technology Association is two organizations parallel to the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation, with the implementers of the project often cross-cutting.
(Apple Daily: Tiananmen Mother's website is in charge of pottery.) Pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
The relief money is often not successfully delivered to the six or four difficulties.
In 1994, Mr. Xin Ding suggested that a special group was established by Mother Tiananmen, which integrated and responsible for receiving and distribution of rescue funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "Six Four Orphan Education Fund" and 11 years later, after graduation from all six or four or four or four or four or four orphans, MCDF has established the "Six-four-four-four-year-olds' Special Support Fund" and has been in place to date.
These projects are funded mainly from campus and social contributions in the 64th year, from individual generous contributions and supported by the Brothers University Democratic Foundation.
Since 2018, the Labour Research Foundation has also been supported by the Labour Research Foundation.
Until last year, 31 years later, the six-four victims finally received a portion of the donation raised in Hong Kong in the name of the year in Hong Kong.
In the meantime, "Human Rights in China" is also independently implementing their humanitarian assistance projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding has called for the suspension of the six or four donations, and we are really retired old people, not as well as before retirement, thanks to Mr. Ding's "to friends."
We will respect the decisions of the victims, terminate the project within two years and recover immediately if needed.
Thank you and respect for those who have been generous for years and risk delivery of humanitarian assistance.

This studio is really great. I strongly recommend all the little friends!
From reception, makeup, costumes, lights, photography to the end.
The make-up artist is particularly delicate, and you'll fit your makeup, and makeup is a big brand on the line.
Mr. Tanyang doesn't have to say that photography is quite professional.
The whole studio is artistic and two little cats play.
We work in Beijing, and Beijing's better cinema needs to line up six months ahead, and colleagues are in Beijing, and we're looking at it.
I'm looking for this studio, a place with soul attitude.
Our facial face management is worse, and it's a short version of most people, and photographer Liang will catch and record the moment of nature.
Make-up, photographer, late design, a good team.
We're all here and everyone around us.
I've recommended my best friend's past, and my best friend just saw the negative.
I hope a studio like this is not buried, and more people find ta, and they're their own style, not a thousand.

How do I pay?
The meal that's been delivered has been delivered.
No rider receives it.
Now the restaurant clerk calls me.
A programming white that wants to share personal experience.
If you're planning to get into this industry, you can choose to go to a place to train, but if you don't think about it, it's better to learn yourself, after all, and it'll take six months to study.
But if you're planning to get into the pit in this industry, training is a very good choice, especially those who are self-control and their weak, training is a very good option.
If you're more self-contained, you can choose to learn yourself, but it's tired.
It's important to choose a good training institution.
First, it depends on the teacher power of this institution, and if teachers are not strong enough, this training institution is meaningless, and of course some new training institutions are not particularly strong.
Second, look at this training institution before choosing, it's better to look at the students from this institution, after all, only students from the institution know what the institution is, and the course is good or bad.
Hello, I don't know how to answer that question, because it's not a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with the personal situation.
Professional, age, language that wants to learn, even in which city you learn or want to be involved in the industry you want to do.
If you're a student and you haven't graduated, or a computer profession has graduated, then if I have enough time for self-learning, this is the lowest efficiency and cost, and many offline training institutions are actually very good now, but a high learning cost, with more time spent, basically three to six months.
But if I'm talking about this, it's easy to learn, and many learning resources on the Internet are free now, or there are many training resources to go to station b, and if you don't find resources, you can also contact me, get free resources, or detailed advice.
There are also more classic books that can be studied in combination with video.
If you're not a computer professional, but you can also pay for a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it's recommended to train institutions to study, so that it's not hard to learn, teachers are detailed, and there are questions that are specifically answered, and help in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions sign employment agreements, with internal places, and they recommend companies after learning, so that there's a lot of things to find a job.
That's some of my views, and I'm not sure if you don't know your situation, it's probably not detailed. If you have anything else to consult, you can contact me for communication.
I said, by 1:00, I saw it at App.
What do you mean?
I'm not done yet. What are you doing?
I, take over various types (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted water heaters, water purification machines, washing machines, air conditioning, toilet, stoves, smoke machines, lamps, glass polishing, professional sutures, domestic services
Thank you for the people who have given me a little bit of a compliment.
Life doesn't fail every man who works. Watch me if you like. Thank those who are silent to me.
That's life, people just look at the results, they're alone, and we're just gonna have to go back, but we can't go back, but we can't go back, but we can't go back.
Cleaning is work and duty, life is beautiful because of service, service is good for heart.

If you can't hide, you can't face it.
The more you fear, the harder you get down; if you're in trouble, the problem will be solved.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public service management - Xinhua Network
Xinhua Kunming 12th December (Reporter Lin Bei-sei) to continue to help promote rural revitalization of rural public service management policies to help fully advance rural revitalization.
The relevant heads of the Yunnan People ' s Social Council Office described that Yunnan currently developed 4483 million rural public interest jobs for the placement of rural hardship groups, such as the poverty-deficit labour force, and to play an important role in helping people to achieve employment gains, consolidate the results of poverty eradication and effectively enhance the capacity of public services in rural villages.
The new regulation was issued jointly by the seven departments of Yunnan People's Society, Rural Renewal, Finance, etc., which provides uniform norms on the scope of recruitment of rural public interest posts at the grass-roots level, financial management, job development, job management, etc.
In terms of job development settings, the new regulations are clearly set up in accordance with the principles of "Standing, Security Management, Total Control" who develops, who uses, who is responsible for "one person, voluntary public, unified management".
The recruitment process must be conducted in accordance with steps such as announcements, declarations, clearance, publicity, recruitment, pre-school training and placement of induction.
In addition, the new regulations clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development sector of rural public interest jobs, the criteria for subsidies and subsidies for rural public interest posts, which require regular monitoring of the subsidy of rural public interest posts.
Wrong address.
Hello.
Can you cancel the order?
I'll reorder it.
Did you cancel?
Two, while the right has a time of ambition in history, it's not long, it's short because it's bright to give a little sun, sweat with a little water; you're gonna have to look at it, and it's a little bit of a shock.
But to be honest, the right have played a positive role in social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing community should not be denied from the definition of truth standards, the development of the economy and the promotion of administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantees.
Three, for me, although I don't fully agree with Li Weidong's statement, I care about his statement and respect Li Weidong; because he's serious, he's serious about China, and he's serious about China's social problems.
But I object to his anti-communist theory, and I think the anti-necessary revolution, the revolution must lead to social unrest, the loss of the population, and the political group's fish dragons are mixed with the mud, and then foreign countries.
Four, change or improve China's patience and responsibility for the people of the country, political speculation is trying to get chestnuts in fire, that's not right, asshole.
Talk left.
Left, it's a bunch of times and politics.
If the right is positive for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right words and analyze their minds when they need it, then the left is not made, because the left is the worst that the Communist Party throws away!
Five, I've been seeing some friends fighting the left, and I think it's not necessary.
Don't try to be reasonable with the traitor and left. It's all a little bit of a twilight.
And don't try to prove we're right, let alone let the traitors and the left-hand admit it. Why?
I told my friends that when the traitors scold you 50 cents, when the left scolding your right dog, it's just proof that our middle path is right!
Many teenagers have ideals, and when they're old, they forget ideals, or pursue ideals, but they become paranoid.
And the ideals are getting away, even the dragon-killing young man will be a dragon.
I think it's generally binding and freedom, and China's congenital genes from historical culture lead China to be left-handed.
And right-wing in the country, focus on efficiency and development, left-wing regulation, more equitable and safe.
Now society wants to be more equitable, while China and the United States are competing, and it's positive, and it's estimated to last for years.
I can't read it. It's over.
I'm not saying anything. That's how flowers are.
For the last two years, the American Emperor's blockade and siege of the Chinese chip has not only put China in unprecedented distress, but also caused the American business to suffer a huge loss.
The US-Turkish China Chip Industry requires their own businesses and allies to block our chip industry simultaneously, and the direct consequences of the global chip supplier's orders and profits are affected, resulting in reduced research and development inputs from chip production enterprises and declining capacity, resulting in a shortage of chips supply chains worldwide.
Now, the lack of cores has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies, mobile phones, and almost all the industries that use chips are affected.
To master the ownership of the chip, more and more technological giants in the country are moving towards the path of "deminization".
In order to control global semiconductor control and hold the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, the recent frequency of action in the old American movement has also hosted the Chip Summit; it was also an invitation to establish semiconductor alliances and to support the American native technology giants, such as the American old technology giant Intel, to take back its leading position in the chip field, to build two crystal round processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and open up chip substitute operations.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on the build-up and it's likely to take the power-building job.
So sure because Intel, as an old American technology giant, has been able to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat the power build.
However, with this decision in Intel, the founder of the power supply, Zhang Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zh
At the "Master Think Tank Forum 2021" in April this year, Zhang Zhong Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zhong Zhong Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng Zhuang Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhu Zhud the think of the library think was a great place for the world of the world of the project that was a great place to build a chip factory.
Zhang Zhong Zheng was very ashamed of Intel's entry into the crystal circle because Zhang was still obsessed with a grudge against the front desk for over 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the American manufacturing industry, and was the top of the world's semiconductor, the world's semiconductor.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips had been mastered by a few powerful people.
The semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was designed, made to sealing was done by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that time.
But this model makes small businesses vulnerable, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face a huge cost of line construction.
With the call for market demand, after the 1980s, the chip industry began to develop a division of labour cooperation, and in 1984 Zhang Zhong-chul heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, it was possible to establish a plant dedicated to crystal circle manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhong's vision became a reality, and the power generation was born.
The power is targeting the main business at the single link of Crystal Circle Processing, not designed, but only for crystal round manufacturing.
The power that was just created was small in front of Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhong-chul was looking for Intel's investment, but when Intel heard that power was only made of the chip industry, apparently some of them were very self-righteous, despised power, and decisively refused to invest in the build-up.
Zhang Zhongxiang also found Intel despised the crystal circle service.
I didn't think the giants who despise the crystal circle manufacturing service, but now they're going to start working on the crystal round.
So, Zhang Zhong-chul thinks it's ironic to enter the crystal rounder.
The market value of power is now more than Intel.
Intel is naturally afraid to stand himself in the face of a strong attack on the power.
Today, the power has been sprinted to a 3 nm chip, and Intel is still staying at 14 nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
I'm not waiting.

Look at some weird hot search today.
What's normal?
Randomly select three hot searchs: February 2nd dragons rise, good friends rise, and pull-up events, spread into waves, and then [index drops] (sliding curve) eventually dispersing, and if a sub-life love will appear again.
They seem to be different from the Internet network's evolution model.
What's unusual?
Randomly select six hot searches in the same event, showing [sone peak], [saw teeth], [crawl].
[Lone Peaks] is human heating, fast-tracking hot search, causing public attention; [saw teeth] is cyclical heating to ensure the hot search list; [crawl] is collective evacuation, which is "functional" and received a new mission, heading for the new battlefield.
Figure 9, the heat peak of an event happens to be the valley of another event, and the time must be a unified batch of sailors to start a new round of offensives.
The professionalization of black public relations is visible: dozens of hot searches, which attract eyes, which are responsible for Cope, which are in charge of the war-making, which are introspectives, what influence, what are the misleading judgements, which are inciting emotions, which are incible decisions, which are in the middle of the black account, the fine-tuning of the sub-nodes, which take into account almost all the elements of the spread of the spread of the public.
Dissemination is a science that leaves the position, all the subjective factors of emotion, from objective data, and black public relations are invisible.
We'll dig it out when we walk, and we'll dig them out.
Data source: Hot-search time machine.
For the first time, such countries such as Mauritius have discovered cases of infection in the Omikjong drug plant - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News, Beijing, December 12, Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency, reported that Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection of the new coronary mutation virus, Omik's poison plant.

At first, friends introduced it because of trust, so I chose to see my budget for 70,000 basic renovations.
I'm starting a series of tricks to come to the store.
I just showed them my family map, and they didn't measure the house in the field, and they could offer me that my 135th house was 70,000, and probably showed me their materials and didn't know what they were.
Their second trick is that you'll drag you to the deposit if you get to the store.
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they invite their so-called manager to tell you how much you can give the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I'm an example of a living being tricked, paying over 10,000 downs when my mind is impulsive.
He gave me a lot of questions that did not include hydro-renovation, excluding any doors and cabinets, bathrooms, and these three are the cost of the base.
Besides these service points, they're higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company, and let me sign the contract without saying anything.
When I went to them to return money, they showed a very experienced look, with a special team against you.
It's a client's problem with a bite anyway.
There's a lot of details, and I don't want to say it, and don't choose them, because my friends find their houses that are not of good quality, and it's a lot of money later.
Dad, they're the original liars, and now they're beautiful, like they're closed and they're different.
So don't choose the renovation company like this.
We'll look at these consultations when you choose because the renovations are not small money.
If you want to ask the business, please log in or register first.
The publication of various forms of business points is strictly prohibited.
The public reviews the Kunming Renovation Design Channel to provide you with up-to-date business information, such as the U.S. 360 integrated home addresses, telephones, business hours, etc., and find the renovation company, and get a public comment.
So scary, please cancel the order in 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? Like, change the address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation, and if you don't refund me for five to 10 days, you'll have to hold it.
I asked 15 minutes to cancel.
The saliva chicken should be ripe, but it's raw meat.
The stars are about 14 days of the twins.
Xinhua Tianjin, 12 December, an expert in Astronomical Science, presented as the last massive meteor rain of the year, the twin-seat meteor rain of one of the three meteor rains in the northern hemisphere will be a great event on December 14th, and friends who like the meteor rain can be observed in the late half of the day.
Beijing astronomical lovers, Angu, were shot in the Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the meteor rains are a periodic comet, but the parent object of Gemini meteor rain is 3200 asteroid Fae, an Apollo asteroid.
Gemini meteor rain is also known to be the second meteor rain that is not born by comets.
The director of the Astronomy Society of Tianjin City, a Astronomy expert, introduced him that, like a big movie, the twin-seat meteor rain usually appeared at the end of its age, and the "showing period" could last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor rain is known for its high flow and stability, and is known as the three meteor rains in the northern hemisphere, together with the walrus storm.
A significant feature of the twin-seat meteor rain is that the meteor is slow, colorful, and a lot of fire stars, both suitable for vision and for astronomical photography.
Tianjin City astronomical lover Yang Zheng, shot in Tianjin State on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecast shows that this year's twin-seat meteor rain will be at around 15:00 on December 14, at a great time, and that ZHR (in ideal observations, radiation points are above the top of the head, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour) is 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommended index map.
Last year, the twin-seat meteor rain of the "Landing" was impressed, but this year's twin-seat meteor rain would be disturbed by moonlight, and a little discount.
14 November, November 11, the moon is a moon, and bright moonlight can interfere with observations, so that the moon will fall in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the twin-strip rain will rise to a higher level.
Friends who like meteor rain can observe the hours behind the next night, but be careful to keep warm. "
How can more meteors be observed as far as possible?
"No observation in cities can be selected in the suburbs or villages with a high altitude, small light, northeast, and then patiently until the moon falls, to see the observation.
It's important to note that Gemini meteor rains are flowing in all directions, and there's no need to keep staring at the radiation point of the twins.
Friends who like photography want to make a beautiful meteor rain film, better choose a wide angle, a big light lens, use high ISO and maximum arctic.
Based on stability and continuity, tripods, backup batteries and fast-door lines are also essential ... "
Shui Li Peng warned.
What are the differences between laser television and traditional television in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional television is supposed to mean LCD TV, while the difference between laser and LCD TV is market positioning, with the following two main points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the big screen market.
Laser TV is clearly more focused on the big screen market than the full market of LCD TV, or laser television itself is a product of a large screen.
Currently, mainstream LCD television is more than 55 to 65 inches, while laser television is generally over 75 inches, the largest of over 100 inches, fully meeting the user's needs for large screen colour.
In recent years, laser television has been increasing in global deliveries and sales, accounting for over 60% of the total television sales in 80 inches and above.
According to China Yicon, by 2020 the laser television market will grow by more than 14 per cent, continuing to grow at a high rate.
The reason for this good performance in the big screen market is due to the excellent performance of laser television in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television reflection, the light from laser light sources does not directly into the eye, and the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the irritation of the eye is smaller than the back light of LCD TV.
The Chinese Institute for Standardization of Electronic Technology, Sexi Laboratory and Beijing Association and hospital eye experts, have produced 144 test data sets of test data through the same conditions of the population.
Data confirm that laser television does have a strong eye-protective, and even some improvement in specific areas.
At the moment where visual health is increasingly valued, laser television has attracted more and more users with eye protection, but also opens another breakthrough in the colour market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on high-end markets.
Contrary to LCD TV prices, the price of laser television is now mostly over a million dollars, and prices have risen with the upgrading of size and light sources.
Why is laser television so expensive?
It must make sense.
With the evolving level of light sources and technology, laser television has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot be achieved.
With ultra-short focal range projection technology, laser television projection distance is shorter than traditional projection equipment, capable of achieving 100 inches of screen experience within a short distance, with small space required, and the mainframe is small and small.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser television can reach more than 2,000.
The heat is lower, the equipment is low, the television has a longer life.
Besides, many high-end laser televisions carry a number of front-line technologies such as real 4K super-high-resolution paintings, artificial intelligence systems, biomimic screens, which can bring more shocking audio-visual experiences to users.
It's not a false demand, but a product of demand breakdown, about the quality and input output ratio, laser television is not a video player's food, but to balance the screen and the environment, and try, everything is good and bad, and you're afraid to hear the word.
In short, the super-wide angle near-focal projector -- laser TV, had to use expensive super-wide angle lenses and mirrors, which is not the best optical design.
To block some environmental light, using microstructures of Finnel curtains, expensive, 80 inches of prices can basically change 65 inches of liquid crystal.
And one thing, I hate projectors to use a good spot for the eyes, and please, the light on the screen that can see is a direct light for the eye, and you can't see it on the ceiling, and your eyes are not visible, but it's a "direct shot" than the real LCD TV, and it's also on the TV ceiling.
And, if it wasn't a reflection, it wouldn't be like it.
It's just that the heat spots of the high-benefit curtains are ignored, and it's hard to reflect a lot of light in a certain angle.
The quality store at the Visual Aesthetics. There's no branch for now.
With the date of the micro-credit appointment, the little sister sent me the options, and the response was more timely.
I went to see the film at the store, more outdoor wedding dress, it was beautiful, and it was a lot of style.
After that day, I had a simple exchange of his thoughts with my little sister, and patiently tried two sets of style clothes I had to get in touch, and finally finalized the makeup. The photographer would set some props before the photographer shoots, guided the moves, and they were more sophisticated about the details.
But maybe it's not the style I want, but it's supposed to be a nice twilight.
After taking it, the photographer will help pick pictures, communicate later style, feel very careful.
It's about half a month, sitting and waiting for the effect.
The second time, the real king's dinner event, most of the clothes can choose one shot.
Finally, a black dress was chosen to experience different styles.
The whole shooting takes about two hours, makeup plus filming, and the photographer who's in charge of 95, feels a little bit green, hoping to give more advice after the customer's action guidance.
The visual aesthetic studio's preferred quality store.
It's on the front page. Let's see Queenie.
You're gonna have to fill out your name phone and pick the dress, you can choose the dress, and you're patient with three or four sets of clothes, and you've been able to make up for a long time, a service attitude, and then you'll teach you how to make it, it's a big face, it's a half month, three or four days, and it's like it's nothing different from the original film.
[Environment] The whole thing is fine.
There's a lot of clothes.
There's almost three makeup positions. It's a studio inside.
[service] Very passionate and careful.
The modeler is patient.
The photographer will teach you how to move.
If you're not satisfied, the photographer will offer a re-shoot.
[Experience] Maybe it's a little over, and the eyelids were put on three eyelids.
The eyebrows are shaved, a little awkward for the day-to-day non-brows.
The photo was given for 10 days, but the P chart was not very satisfactory, and it felt that those were still obvious.
Because it's not clear what it's going to do, try two sets, and pick it out, or she picked the black dress, and the little sister says it's a little bit more like a Hepburn retrospect.
When you pick your clothes, you start making makeup, and the hairdresser and the make-up sister are so patient and they're doing it very well.
I've been taking pictures after making makeup, and the photographers are in charge of my position, and the process is easy and harmonious.
After the film, I picked four of your favorite as a fine brother said it was a very happy ending.
No reply on 3 days... because your system cannot identify my credit card, I can't join the .PRS_ORG's monthly fee scheme!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every payment.
I'm always paying for the freight.
Can you get my monthly fee after your investigation?
Small umbrella for insurance, okay?
The umbrella is an Internet insurance broker platform.
In terms of setting conditions: According to the "insurance broker regulation (revised in 2015)", three keywords must be met: shareholders, sponsors have no significant record of violations for the last three years, with a minimum limit of 50 million yuan to be established, and must be agreed by the China Insurance Board.
These three are actually very harsh, summarizing the power, and by the approval of the national authority of the Silver Insurance Board (supervising insurance companies, banks), shareholders must have a good style, as a small umbrella insurance for insurance brokers, and the insured is not too much to question whether small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are three thresholds, not any insurance company.
It's good at that point. It's trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' stars are sold on this platform, such as the latest shelf and the Thai Super Mary 5 heavy risk, the compensation and the insured are both Thai life, small umbrella insurance is a third-party broker, without questioning its spectroscopy.
From the payment model: Internet platform products, because of the cost of operating sites and the cost of business staff, the Internet product is more expensive and flexible in providing monthly contributions, reducing the debt pressure of the insured, while maximizing the leverage of the insurance.
That's still very good.
You can think about it.
In terms of the professional level of operators: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very demanding industry, and many Internet product clients can insured themselves, and there are many errors, and in health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when insured, feel healthy or consistent, so that there are many risk of a settlement that can be denied.
I've been selling insurance phone calls myself, very responsible for telling you.
Internet insurance is real, and it's true, it's human, Internet channels don't have professional practitioners, and there's a lot of misdirection.
For example, $6 million for insurance, insurance for mobile phones, which are free of charge, and these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they're light, and they don't tell the insured person, 1st month, and the next month is a normal fee, dozens to 200, and many clients buy it for a year or two years.
Thought I could spend a dollar, and the insurance company paid $6 million.
Free phone delivery is sent by special policy sections like 6666,888, and if the winning text messages are sent, they don't exchange, and no one's warning.
This is another pit for the insured person, which is free of charge, which is short-term, if it's only this, no other business insurance, if there's a serious illness, 60,000 can't solve the problem, and life will start running naked.
The country is also severely hit by misdirection of Internet insurance sales.
So, in general, the platform is no problem, no product, and the problem is the professional and professional conduct of the operator.
The main theme is carefully considered, but many offline insurance brokers have wider products, and clients can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are more expensive than Internet products.
I've helped 59 Internet clients myself, under-line products, and the premium saves 2000-3000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, you're welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
I: Mingya Insurance Broker, with three years of experience in corporate management training, served nearly 1,000 business users, working with over 100 insurance companies, and before I insured, I would customize the insurance products for clients, and in insurance, in insurance, three customers, trying to get the best nuclear insurance results for clients, after insurance, to sort out the client's policy, to keep the client safe.
Growing up with every client.
I hope my answer will help the question!
According to the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is the insurance business that the insured person can do all insurance processes after clicking on the insurance link.
In the process, the insured person does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be done by the insured person.
Although Internet insurance insurance is not too much "certitude" and may not even have a print paper contract, it does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of electronic contracts.
This pattern, it's kind of like a "telephone sales" flow line, but there's a fatal problem with such insurance, which is -- the subsequent service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades, and should we think about it when we buy insurance, and should we think about this "intermediate" that we choose, not a "insurance broker" who can be with us for a long time, who will serve us many years later?

No problem. Remember not to arrange a re-transmitment. I've bought it, I don't want to waste it.
Thanks for your help.
I've been against any form of contempt and scolding, and I can't accept such physical attacks.
In civilized society, we can accommodate everything, but we can stop this villain.
If you don't look at political parties and sects, it's the uncivilized style.
Since you started sending Facebook and friends' requests, and then I've published a tactful post, and I've been trying to post my home place and father's name on social media.
You've been trying to keep me on the frequency of six meals a day, and you're still talking about some hidden, humiliating statements, appearances, body, well-born, bed-bed strawberries, or messages like that, and I'm...
I've been sent to a lot of friends about your Facebook friend's account on your photo and sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep quiet anymore.
After the news that I called the police, you were completely unsettled, but you were more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, and whatever identity you are, in our society, they need both sexual respect.
Yes, you can continue this kind of flirting, hidden, humiliating, insulting speech, and you can continue to say that you're just caring and watching me, and you can continue to think it's not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it's not your map or continue to make all offensive statements.
Yeah, I can't, I can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and my body doesn't need your head.
I don't even think any girl would let others humiliate themselves for fame.
My friend asked me, are you okay?
I said yes, you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl will be so bullied and say she's okay.
In work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic character can choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe in justice.
I cut some messages to judge you.
You can't pretend to be you with your own sticker.
I can only say you're a public enemy of civilization.
I'll laugh.

The latest satellite images show that the three American carriers are gathering around China; the most powerful weapons of the United States have rare access to Guam 2022-01-17, and the Chinese Communist Party media multi-dimensional report: The latest satellite images show that the three American carriers are gathering around China; the media also discloses one of the most powerful weapons of the United States Navy's weapons bank to visit Guam, releasing important signals from allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank, the South China Sea Strategic state perception platform, on January 9, the satellite discovered the American Army carrier near the Barabak Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South Sea and the Sulu Sea, which is the strategic element of the West Pacific First Island chain.
The platform expects Carl Vincent to deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the carrier Carl Vincent was deployed on the F-35C and the CMV-22 Fish Eagle carrier.
The American carrier, who is now upstream in the Pacific, in addition to the Carl Vincent, has the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier from the United States on January 3.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which is part of the 314th United States Marines.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the United States Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan carrier in Japan.
The carrier combat group also includes the "Shangpuran Lake" missile cruiser, the Stokdar missile destroyer, etc.
On January 17, 2022, the U.S. San carrier gathered the most powerful weapons around China, and on January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform released the latest satellite picture showing that the three American carriers are gathering around China.

The U.S. three carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China rarely visit Guam, and analyses that this is a signal to allies and enemies in the growing tension in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first time that the United States ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second public visit since the 1980s.
The three American carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China rarely visit Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South Sand Islands in recent years.

Talk to friends about the recent drop of Meta by 26 per cent, market value evapo, $251 billion, and Zuckerberg responded to "a unprecedented competition."
Meta is essentially an advertising company, mainly from advertising, and today's money-making advertising company has a flow channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., whatever functional location, is Meta's traffic channel.
Not only that, Meta is the largest advertising union, many App ads that are outside Meta, and through Meta's advertising platform is a realization.
But the times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple privacy policy, Meta has difficulty getting user data information, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's privacy policy is user-friendly, and it's obvious that users allow App to access their own information, and most people's normal reaction is certainly not allowed.
And then if Google stabbed another one, it'll have a bigger impact on Meta's income.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in the income growth of Meta was weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but that's not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's income comes from China, mainly China's companies that make sea operations.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about hundreds of people, and there are a few major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand the overseas market, Meta is a desperate advertising channel, and most of the money that burns give Meta.
Interestingly, now the byte TT is one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from bytes in the first two years.
All agents in the country are helping bytes to advertise in Meta, and Meta is doing a great job.
I haven't been familiar lately, but it's not better than before.
The Chinese company's phase of massive burning money abroad is over.
Third, new traffic channels are not going well.
Facebook is getting older, new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets are not just looking at income, but more importantly, but what future expectations are.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg told the universe.
The universe should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the future cycle of the universe is longer, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the two or three years.
So the next two years, it's supposed to be a tough time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook, and it's worth $100 billion to $200 billion a year, and Facebook is now in a very crisis, and there's no safe moat than other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his social software is now high and mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., there is no confidence in Facebook, Facebook, Facebook is blinking.
And the promising concept of the universe, which has no hope for success in a short time, so Facebook is very dangerous, and that's why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company, and it's the root reason why Zuckerberg is looking for a new track, but I think his track's choice is wrong, and it's a way to go back to some of my thoughts, for information.
