Civil rights groups issued a travel warning against Missouri.
As a result of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Promotion of Colored People (NAACP) warned the colored people who were preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Consulting, which came into effect on August 28, 2017, called for a series of suspicious ethnic events in Missouri, all African American travellers, tourists and Missouris should pay special attention and take extremely cautious attitudes when travelling in Missouri, in particular, "the group ' s statement claims.
NAACP notes that a recent Missouri law has made it more difficult for people to win discrimination proceedings, and that law enforcement in the state has to some extent targeted minorities, which have prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were beaten or killed by parking questions for colour, "The Kansas City Star, President of NAACP, Missouri.
"We have received many complaints, not previously. "
This is the first such warning that the organization has issued in the United States against a state.
The organization quoted the racial defamation of black students by Missouri University and the death of a black male, Toly Sanders, 28-year-old Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Saunders died in suspicious circumstances.
The consultation also noted that a recent report of the Attorney General's Office of Missouri showed that "the possibility of black drivers in the state being checked by parking plates is 75% higher than whites."
Chapber said, "The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri."
"People need to be prepared, whether they carry bail to Missouri or to let their relatives know they travel within the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime report programme, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the crime volume, the state ranked 16th in the country.
Travel warnings are also a response to the new law in Missouri, which will make it more difficult to prosecute housing or employment-discrimination enterprises.
Previously, the U.S. states passed immigration law enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to detain immigration violations, and the United States Civil Freedom Union (ACLU) indicated that this would increase the number of racial proceedings and issued travel advice against Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but recently, advisory groups have taken this approach to certain laws and trends in the United States.

BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: making foreigners feel "living in a new era."
On January 18, the media reported that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming a modern charm city today.
The capital of China has an amazing Internet, with sophisticated technology such as face recognition software, and has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has invincible international energy, one of the most exciting cities for foreigners rich in exploring spirit.
According to BBC website on January 16, the German immigrant Clemens Seshi said, "If I can succeed there, I'll succeed anywhere." He quotes the singer Frank Sinatla Song to celebrate New York City.
Seshi, who was the creative director of the Traveler Archives magazine, said, "If Sinatra survives today, he'd probably sing cities like Beijing." He said that living in this city would always keep up with the tide.
The old home is in England, but Simon Norton, who recently lived in Beijing, published an article on the personal blog site 4Corners 7Seas, saying, "There's a feeling that people are generally in the center of something big, which is hard to say, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it's gonna be and want to witness it with their own eyes."
Reports say that the city's high-quality, high-speed Internet and technologically friendly environments make daily life easier than ever.
From Manila, Andy Penia Fuelt, currently as Deputy Editor of Beijing Children, said, "Beijing is rapidly transformed into a cash-free society, integrating traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions."
According to reports, but smartphones are only the beginning of the technology ambition in Beijing, and facial recognition software is already widely available, and many mobile phone applications use them for bank transfers and payments, allowing people into apartments and offices, even using it to verify the identity of the Internet driver.
Beijing recently announced plans to build an artificial intelligence technology park at a cost of $13.8 billion, where more than 400 companies will be built, and will focus on developing artificial intelligence technologies from biometric to auto-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in China, and participation in these celebrations is admired by foreigners, spring Festival is the most important social and economic festivals and one of the most vulnerable festivals for foreigners.
Seshi said, "I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year's New Year's Eve, cleaning the apartment and the red spring union with New Year's blessing, and on New Year's Eve, all family members would have to gather a big meal, and then watch until midnight, to meet the New Year with a bright fire. For foreigners, it is an opportunity to integrate this night with friends and family."
According to reports, the number of foreigners in Beijing is growing, but Chinese language barriers and the convenience of communication between foreigners is easily an excuse for their incomplete integration into local culture.
Seshi said, "Some foreigners have lived in China for years, but there's hardly any experience in their host country. If your initial contact with the Chinese is not successful, then you can feel easier to live with other foreigners.
"In these so-called "foreign bubbles" ( "foreign bubbles" means foreigners are mixed only among foreigners, without contact with locals and local cultures â€” translators), foreigners hugging in their own communities, eating in Western restaurants and only foreigners among friends.
The simplest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin -- it's easier than people might imagine.
Seth said, "A single hour or two hours a week or an introductory radio show should be suitable for everyone's busy schedule."
Even a few classic short sentences will help shopping, order meals in restaurants or chats in taxis.
Reports say that stubborn air pollution is also a fact in everyday life, but in recent years the government has worked to contain some problems.

Norton said, "Beijing is a Chinese city that can find the most important art and music activities, a night life of love, historical wonders, super-modern business zones and ancient hype."

Google hasn't commented on it right away.

A picture of the legal status of bitcoin around the world.
Summary: In addition to the natural price shift of speculation properties, the decline in digital currency in this round is not related to the "host" - regulatory risk.
From visual maps, the attitude of Eastern countries towards bitcoin is more conservative than the West, and countries that account for global subjects are still watching the legitimacy of digital currency, representing the risk of the Black Swan.
* This is from Wall Street, editor Wang Mu. For more wonderful information, or download Wall Street to see the APP.*
With the regulatory storm in major markets such as China, Korea and the EU, the global digital currency led by bitcoin has been washed since this week, bitcoin prices have fallen $10,000 in psychological integers on Tuesday and the largest single-day drop in three years.
In addition to the price of speculation properties naturally triggered, the fall of the digital currency in this round is not related to the constant "host" -- regulatory risk.
At this important level, the visualization of the big data site HowMuch.net produced a map showing the legitimacy and regulatory status of bitcoin in countries around the world.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legitimate market of bitcoin; oranges represent neutral markets, although not publicly legalized, but there is no major use restrictions; light pink represents restricted markets, i.e. local government attempts to use digital currency through red line policy or regulation; deep pink represents the illegal country; grey is an unrated country.
(The above figure is from the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15th.)
The article states that the distribution of non-green colour blocks in the chart can be seen that the traditional Eastern countries are more conservative towards bitcoin than the West.
Russia is the largest country currently defined bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets in bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that is not yet rated and has not yet introduced the policy.
North America and Western Europe are the most acceptable areas of bitcoin, namely, the distribution of green blocks.
The views of the Middle East and Latin American countries about bitcoin are clearly divided, and the distribution of colour blocks in the above-mentioned areas is more mixed.
Of these, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are legal bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, etc., with some restrictions on their transactions and use, and more American countries have not spoken to bitcoin.
The synthesis of the above data is known that 99 countries (or 40 per cent) of the world-based countries (or 40 per cent) do not limit the transactions and use of bitcoin, namely, green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) are restricted markets (light pink), with 10 countries (or 4 per cent) defined bitcoin as illegal (deep pink), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) have not treated digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that countries that the global subject (53%, more than half) are still watching the legitimacy of the digital currency headed by bitcoin, and also represents the "black swan risk" of bitcoin, as some of them may eventually make legislative decisions that limit digital currency.
The article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the emerging category of digital currency and may be the main reason why most countries have not made a statement.
Although Bitcoin's "human" has grown at an index level since last year, does not represent interest in all countries, some countries may fear that local French currency is threatened or more worried that digital currency is being used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news on bitcoin since last week, including China's central service platform and mobile App, and Korea is still considering closing the digital currency exchange, and the EU believes that bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warned investors of the risk of "recovered to blood."
Wall Street saw the editor-in-chief, "Reading the Queen of the World's Day 2018: The Year of Digital Currency" was mentioned that from any point of view of regulation, acceptance/critical, it would be the digital currency year of the global central bank.
Russia and others criticized the legitimacy of bitcoin, which is also intended to give the official digital currency a way.

What else is sacred?
Now the White House in Trump is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most certain sign of regime change is when they started attacking the statue.
So in 2003, Saddam Hussein of Baghdad Paradise Square was carefully pushed down.
Stephen Miller, one of the key think tanks of the Trump government, in a violent debate with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposal to strictly restrict legitimate immigrants, he must know what would happen to cut a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
If he does, a group of cruise owners and liberal followers will swallow him alive.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when Emma Lazarus was carved on the base in 1903.
As Miller called Acosta, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is like the symbol of America's freedom to light up the world...
The poem you're talking about, which was later added, not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Actually, Miller was right, but, as he said, it's not really about history.
This involves a modern echo of Lazarus, and the only country seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also invites the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowd is eager to breathe freely,/suffering people refuse your crowded beaches."
There is no "suffering people refuse" to become more obscurant on our screen.
Miller didn't do literary reviews, and he made it clear that these people would not be welcomed in the United States of the Trump era.
This conflict about statues is part of the broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the spirit of the United States.
Lazarus, and her, after her death, carved her poems on the foundation, know that their actions are highly political.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the link between French and American Republicanism by the femaleization of the goddess of liberals.
Lazarus changed that: in her poem, the image of a woman is no longer abstract, and she's going to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: Mother of the exile.
The poem combined with this painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American nativeism.
As Lazarus changed the statue, the right wing always wanted to change it back.
The great speaker Rush Limbaugh, a temporary baptism from Trump, believed in 2010 that liberalism was not inviting anyone, and he was now an early neoconist who brought the wisdom of America to the foolish world: "The Statue of Liberty is brave.
She was meant to bring the torch from America to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the road to light up America. "
It's unusual that Limbo was actually moved by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive angle.
When tired, poor but promising people will see it after long and often terrible journeys, they can see it on the deck.
On the surface, it involves the perspective of people who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives in the world.
Her statue conveys to them and needs hope and welcome.
Of course, that's not what Miller and Trump wanted to admit.
They're not just about lighting the road, but to light up their only source of hatred.
In 2006, Sa's top joined the world record with a unique music style, became the first Chinese to sign with the British headquarters around the world.
The 2017 World Championship: Neil Black highly commends the Scottish team on the British National Team.
Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scottishs on the British National Team.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the British Association of Fields, said that a team of 16 strong Scottishs in the World Championship would make a huge contribution to the National Team.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the 2017 London Track World Championship, which was opened on Friday, was the most historic.
Blake thinks, "Scotland is getting extraordinary development," and British track athletes must learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will continue until we succeed " , Blake says.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Academy, and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish track athletes think it's about their actions.
The British Association of Fields and Fields thinks it's about their actions.
Even street people think so.
Whatever it is, it's brilliant. "
A number of Scottish track athletes are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be low at 5,000 meters with Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain by the team.
"Arid's a little modest.
Her captain's speech is incredible." Blake said.
"Many track athletes, whether they are Scottishs, or wherever they live or trained, are proud to walk out of the door.
Eric's natural passion and true feelings are very good. "
The Commonwealth silver winner who will attend the 400-metre cross-bar game in its fifth World Championship says that 16 Scottishs on the British National Team, which is "unbelievable".
Previously, the number of Scottish track athletes who participated in the World Competition was up to seven, the number of contestants in 1983 and 2015.
She's got five British records and two European records in the past year.
She's going to the 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who was in the 1500-metre project, was another Scottish player of concern, before she had a good score in the season, winning the pre-election and Olympic anniversary in the British countries.
Doyle remembered her first World Championship, when the only Scottish on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said that she was proud that many of her fellow citizens joined the team, but in some cases, they would challenge medals and compete for the finals.
"The special thing about becoming captain of the National Team is that it was elected by other members of the National Team. So, knowing your teammates voted for you for a very unusual achievement, and it's a great honor for me."
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottish players.
It just shows how far we're going.
And they're all old track athletes here, and they're about to move towards the purpose of the winning stage.
How was my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's great.
I was just looking at the fact that in this case, we were very lucky because we had the World Championship on the home.
So, it's really important that we have been able to build with home support and to return to the Olympic Stadium.
I'll get a second chance to compete, and the atmosphere will be amazing. "
In 2016, China had a total of 180,000 employees, with an employee cost of 121.8 billion, an increase of 21 per cent over the same period.
Block critics on Facebook: If you can't stand voters' blame, don't run for public office.
Our father knows the bad media.
The Americans love Washington, but soon after, the major newspapers began to criticize him, from domestic policy to political principles, and none of them.
He's upset about these criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn't whisper these critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, " Freedom of expression is deprived -- we'll be slaughtered in silence and ignorance like lambs."
It reminds me of Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people because they put their views on his Facebook official home page.
The U.S. Civil Liberty filed a lawsuit earlier this week.
The governor's staff think the lawsuit was hasty, and online reports are full of their strong resistance: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
This is particularly important because people like Hogan are facing people.
This is a Republican who is governor in a democratic majority state, and he's also very popular.
Of the 50 governors of the country, he's got a second rating.
Hogan's not a retardant.
He's in charge of Maryland, strictly following the rules.
He's also very good at Facebook as the main way to communicate with voters, and he's showing his vultures on the home page for the first time.
So the people who blocked the Governor's home page are completely unnecessary and eventually dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Shas, defended the governor's behavior that she thought that blocking their comments were just trying to restrain them.
But they're too hasty described it as flood beasts or cynics who swept the network.
The Washington Post spoke to face to face with people blocked by Hogan.
They're just ordinary people talking to their chosen leadership: they're teachers, small business owners and priests, not a flood beast.
They're saying they're deep, respectful, not dirty.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and called on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
The chief lawyer in Boy, Maryland, Lakhimi Salma Ramani, is not cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.
She wrote in the Washington Post news story review, "I politely commented that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crime and other recent news events.
I also don't like a group of people who comment on the same subject, because these people will be ignored directly by some people who think they are so-called psychology, not as citizens of a group of poor people. "
The governor's staff called "intensive garbage information bombing" might be "sustaining" in others.
Facebook makes it easier to change a message, just to block a critic or delete a negative comment.
And it was much cleaner than the past, and the same effect had to be sent to send staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical statements or arrest or silence protesters.
But that's what's happening now, but at the digital level.
Hogan wasn't the first public official to be accused of whispering on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being prosecuted by Twitter because he blocked them on Twitter.
Last week, a landmark ruling in Virginia was about such issues.
According to James c. Cacharis, District Judge of Alexandria, the Lauden County Supervisory Committee blocked voters from her Facebook home page, in violation of the First Amendment.
The Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin (R) was also visited by the American Civil Freedom Alliance for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet have similar influence.
The number of news newspapers tripled between 1776 and 1800, and someone wrote anonymous letters to criticize his leadership.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous flood beast against him.
People write to the newspaper with false names such as Yurikra, Valerius, Belizalu, Bogus and others to strongly criticize Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper online project, his office was flooded and criticized for his attitude on His Majesty King and the United States of America's friendly, commercial and navigation treaty with the United States of America.
But he didn't make them sound.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
And the real leader needs to accept that.
The wind blows in the city of the building, which is touching people's sensitive nerves.
The limit is a tough bar for many urban real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jenan introduced a provision that undergraduate students had a six-month continuous social security policy and had access to the same housing purchase policy for local permanent household residents;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that the university student graduated with a diploma and employment certificate for three years.
Then the policy added, and officially stated that "university students can buy a house below 20 per cent of the market price";
In July, Chengdu introduced a rule that young people with undergraduate and above in field universities can apply for residence in Chengdu with a diploma.
Besides, there are cities or regions such as Quinshan, Shanghai Port-au-Prince have introduced policies to reduce the threshold for talent purchases.
Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually the competition for the population, especially talent, and that is the most important meaning of these real estate policies.
Some even think that this means the time for the city's "limited purchase" has arrived.

Ronan Lafferty looks forward to enjoying home at the Renaissance Club.

The athletes will see the best face and best state of this field.

He's a keen champion of this game and proud of what he's doing here.
This is the best stage to show this field."
England Ils looks forward to the first crown, although in his 32-year career, he has won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
This Sausport athlete said, "It's really special.
I didn't defend the Estremadura Open, because the game was cancelled in the second year I won.
It's amazing to come to this place.
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's memories emerged, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was of a special meaning to us.
It was a special memory, and we'll always remember. "
Back to the home race was Gary Al, who was only 50 years old earlier this year and then went to the European Changqing Tour.
This is his first Scottish competition since the Scottish Golf Open in 2013.
The Helensburg Al said, "Go home town always makes more sense.
You want to do it; but you can feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again. I've been playing golf.
I'm satisfied with the current situation. "
The three-person team joined the former master's winner Ian Wousnan and Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNetti.
There were six Scottish athletes, Al and former Leed Cup captain Sam Torrance, two of them, and the other four were Andrew Odcon, Stephen McCallister, Bill Rumu and Ross Drummond.

In August, the Director of the Environmental Inspectorate of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, introduced 57 cases of continuous penalties throughout the country, which was implemented in early this year with a clear addition to the environmental enforcement of the Environmental Protection Act in China.

In August, in August, a total of 335 cases were seized throughout China; 177 cases of cut-off, total of 177 cases of cut-off; 189 cases of administrative detention and 166 cases of alleged environmental pollution.
Of these, Henan has seven continuous penalties, and China is currently being embedded from the end to the entire process, fully increasing environmental pollution management.
Although the pressure of the economy is emerging, the Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously made clear that China should properly address the positioning of environmental protection in economic development and enhance the "green power" and the less economic growth, the less it can relax and play a good role in environmental protection for the economy.

Zhejiang Province has been promoting the spirit of the Red Boat with firm action to make work ahead of the times.
The new water samples just finished, and Liu Ri and his colleagues were busy.
While day-to-day monitoring
This year they're trying to attack the intelligent management of rural sewage.
How to manage it well, then it's actually a very serious challenge.
The Institute of Eco-Environment of the Zhejiang Qinghua Triangular Institute is located in the spirit of the Red Boat.
From a decade ago, nothing to now.
The Zhejiang Qinghua Triangular Institute has developed three national-level priority innovation platforms, with nearly 400 overseas students in the regional innovation gathering of Zhejiang.
The spirit of the Red Ship is a force we have to follow and understand. Innovation is difficult.
Every innovation in this.
I feel like you can't solve the extent, and you're gonna keep walking.
So the people came to the door. Now it's up to the bottom, so that's what it means.
To do something for the people.
So far, in this way, the Xiao Mountain has collected a total of 5,955 problems, of which $3,86, and the problem being processed is 1,4906.
We have a word for our cadres.
Geographical advantages are not as good as cadres, policy preferences are not as good as service, and the dedication of the red ship spirit can make us move forward, and it's going ahead.
Be brave enough to fight.
Recently, the Chinese Federation organized a group of representatives of the arts and arts community and prominent artists to travel to Mongolia, Heilong River, Gansu, Shanghai, Guangdong, Guizhou, etc.
They went deep into Inner Mongolia, the grass-roots mass art gallery, local colleges and some higher education institutions, and the new cultural mission for 19 spiritual Chinese artists.
I'm so proud and happy, I'm willing to sink and sink again, and write down the fate of the small people of the great times.
What good advice can be made in this grass-roots culture development?
There's a little bit of a popular art.
The best work of the times is constantly being launched.
It's supposed to be a grass-roots, deep life, and then it's a certain cultural thickness, positive, with a constant artistic charm.
Twenty-eight, with an area of 15:200 million acres, with 11:100 million acres completed.

It is expected that the national contracting authority will be largely completed by the end of 1808
In the future, the Ministry of Agriculture will explore the results of the right.
Our first star in the space science satellite series is also the world's first dark matter particle detection satellite Goku.
In the last two years, four scans were conducted in the full-scale area, detected over 3.5 billion high-energy particles, and the most accurate in the world.
This result was published in the international academic journal Nature.
In space, we have observed a new one that was observed before, which was not explained and explained with the existing theory.
The results of this study are multiple, and most importantly, it shows the cutting edge of Chinese scientists.
The ability to create scientific instruments to detect a very difficult scientific problem.
Looking for toilets with noses. It was a century of memories of Chinese toilets.
It's also integrated into more and more human design.
I'm impressed by a lot of tourists.
You don't have to look for the bathroom anymore.
It's not just about changing hardware.
The tourism sector requires that the area toilet should be equipped with toilet paper, handwashing fluid.
But in some areas,
Is it possible to stop this people's service because of the uncivilized behaviour of others?
The managers everywhere made their choices.
On the one hand, through civilization to advocate for savings, on the other hand, technological innovation is being made.
Public toilets in Jiangsu Nanking, Cebu, etc.
You can get a toilet paper free of charge for three seconds, but it takes 10 minutes to get doubles.
Avoiding abuse of public resources
It's a habit that some tourists really want to put paper back, but on the other hand, we have to reflect.
Is it the next toilet that our tourists are going to enter, so that's what we're saying in the new three-year plan?
We're gonna have to solve this unbalanced piece.
The toilet revolution is about thinking more about what the crowd thinks.
There must be a third bathroom to facilitate family escorts with old people, children to the bathroom.
We brought the baby. We're embarrassed to be in the bathroom.
The girl's toilet kid is so small as she knows a little awkward. That board is particularly comfortable and convenient for us to bring kids.
And while people feel civilization, they become civilized builders, and in the countryside of the Guangxi River pool is building new flush toilets in their homes.
It has been a great deal of success that actively promotes the toilet revolution not only helps people stay away from disease, but also to bring economic development gaps to narrow regional development gaps.
This toilet problem is a problem with an outline, a node of social problems.
It's a national civilization project that leads to layout from a national perspective and then solves small social problems from different degrees of participation.
So we'll get all our short-terms.
With the construction of the project in the Jinxi district of Heilongjiang, 14 new water projects have been launched this year.
The investment is $900 billion.

Poverty and death in gold in Indonesia
Badtina Dejay doesn't have a stove when he cooks.
She doesn't even use pots.
Her cabin is located in Enarotali, the capital of Pania, Indonesia, where the housewife usually puts a potato -- the locals called "nota" directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burning potatoes were taken out by a pair of unwashed hands, and they swallowed them.
Dejie sits on the mud -- she doesn't have furniture, and this is where she does routine family groceries, like washing clothes, washing clothes, all from the nearby swamp.
A room without a roof with a bucket, which is the outdoor toilet.
She's the youngest one of the four wives of her husband, so she's not separated from the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, it's dangerous to work late: most men in the village don't work and many of them are drunk, and there's a lot of soldiers here.
She said, "No one dares to walk in the village after 5:00 p.m.."
This is a rare glimpse of daily life in the Papua Heights, once a Dutch colony, which was incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, but the referendum was controversial, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote before the army occupied here.
The movement against Dutch rule quickly directed at the Jakarta government, as the government has imposed high pressure rule over the region, isolated foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province officially divided into Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controls the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is in a remote position, a waste of smoke; to come here, we need to take 90 minutes from the province to the province to go to the Bere, then rent a car for five hours, and it's all over the stomach.
There's no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the cabin is surrounded by bamboo fences, wrinkled iron roofs are all kinds of brown cover made of rusty.
Few Indonesians come in, let alone journalists, and there are few foreigners.
Before the Christian preacher arrived, the Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god named Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here.
Dejie said, "We're not dressed in these clothes." She means her beautiful hand-weaved turban, dark shirt and a nice half-dress.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line, and the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also the gold continent of Indonesia.
Pania County is located on the same area as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The largest and most profitable gold mine Glassberg is 60 miles from here, owned by Philip McMolan Copper Gold, based in Phoenix.
In 2015, Philip was here to exploit about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has a rich timber resource, estimated at $78 billion.
But these rich resources are also the source of the Papua tragedy, and Indonesia's powerful military forces have been able to suppress them.
A 2005 survey by The New York Times shows that Philip paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, and that one official alone was $150,000.
The Papuans' demands for independence are increasingly strong, threatening the gold lord, and they have suffered cruel treatment.
According to defenders, over 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, thousands of people raped, tortured and detained by Indonesian troops.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass massacres in Papua tribal heights in the 1970s have escalated to genocide.
The Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year alone.
A 2016 report, "We will lose everything" in the Catholic Brisbane General Church, which included proofs of the terrible acts of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture â€” another report claims that rape and electricity are particularly widespread â€” and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
Human Rights Watch Indonesian researcher Andreas Halsano said, "Violence is happening every day and it is therefore difficult to calculate the number of victims. "
Papua's resources are being recruited to a large number of immigrants outside Indonesia, and oppression begins.
83 per cent of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but Muslim economic migrants have changed their demographic structure from the densely populated Java, Garimandan, Sumatra, Sumatra, Sulawesi.
Java's snack stand sells fried chickens and vegetables mixed with peanut butter.
The locals are trying to fight.
24-year-old Pania local Apos Yu moved to the provincial council Chaaprah to find work, saying, "The immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market at lower prices than the local Papuans.
This has lost their market for the local Papuans, the Papua women. "
Indonesian President Zoco Vidodo (commonly known as Zokovy) vowed to address Papua inequality and abuse of authority at his 2014 campaign.
The former carpenter's road to the Jakarta presidential palace was supported by 27 of the 29 regions, including Pania.
But Papua didn't change anything. Today, the locals felt betrayed.
And he said, "We've broken our heart, and in 2014 we voted for Zokovy, hoping he will fulfill our wishes and restore justice."
In fact, only two months after Zokovy took office in October, Pania had the worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotali sang Christmas hymns in front of the bonfire, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly came in on a motorcycle.
The scared kids told them they should turn on the headlight.
According to local priest Avette Tebai, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses say these drunk soldiers hit the kids chasing them with their guns.
And then one of the soldiers shot the kids.
16-year-old Ulynus Yemer was unconscious because he was beaten badly.
A few hours later, the nearby government agency election committee building set up a fire, and the next day the incident escalated.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of local police and military command centres to demand justice.
They danced the watera dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe -- running around and imitating birds.
Some protesters started throwing stones at military regular posts.
According to an official document that was seen in Times magazine, when emotions continued to provoke, soldiers received orders through internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, he will not be released to the local media."
56-year-old Jeremias Kayamu, the leader of the Enarotali Kego Koto neighbourhood, felt dangerous, and called on the crowd to calm down and begged them to go home.
But nobody's in the mood to hear him.
He stood on the porch of his colorful cabin and told Time magazine that when I came back, my left wrist suddenly got shot."
Kayam still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he said the bullet came from the soldiers who gathered.
He said, "It was crowded, they fired a lot of guns."
According to the cousin of the local Olfius Yul, he witnessed the shooting and saw Olfius Yul shot three times.
Yuhanes sadly told the Times magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if it was him,
I found him dead and I kissed him."
Chief Inspector Yuji Mende of Papua police told the press that his subordinates were just "protecting" police stations because the police station was attacked.
In 2015, the police spokesman for Papua, Police Chief Pgio Sulistio said, "We must defend ourselves when someone threatened to kill us.
It's about life and death. "
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and more injured.
The next day about the killing was passed slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi gave a voice and a strong speech in Chaapura, expressing deep sympathy for the victim ' s family and vowed to address the abuse of authority left behind in Papua's history.
He said, "I hope this case will be resolved as soon as possible, so that this will never happen again."
In October 2016, Minister of Security, Verando, stated that he was going to establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuses to take off are almost ringing.
He said, "Most of the violations took place a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but this requires a process ... "
Then on June 5, in Jakarta, Verando was in a conversation with the Times magazine, saying he had no plan to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be settled in accordance with the law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Verando on more than 1,000 deaths in the bloody independent vote in Timor-Leste in 1999, but he said that 11 human rights violations in Papua region had been resolved, including the Pania incident.
The family of the victims of the Pania incident snuffed these words.
Yuhanes said, "I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't made any progress."
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army and afraid of being shot."
His brother Yukabbs also thinks the people of Pania are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said, "When the body was buried, the military came to me."
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deay County, Pani Ai.
One construction manager refused to help transport a coma man to the hospital, in conflict, one person died and 17 others injured, including children.
The 24-year-old man Lavianus Dow drowned while fishing by the nearby river and died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's live office.
Police say the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police shot.
But the rioting force (Indonesia paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and one was killed.
The 29-year-old Doming Valley Buddy told the Times magazine that "We were panicking and now we were afraid they'd get revenge." "He lived near the hospital and saw the wounded being sent to the hospital in a hurry.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deyi Parliament has called for the police involved to justice and to evacuate the rioting forces from the area.
Pania has always been a place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has grown the grievances of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribal peoples, scattered in the central highlands of Pani Ai.
Many people joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army claiming to protect the rights of Papuans through decentralized attacks and raiding Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Pania, including Tadiius Yuji and Daniel Yudas Kogoa.
As a result, thousands of Panias have been arrested in recent years by the military under the cover of "maintening State sovereignty" and deliberately detained.
Some people never showed up again.
In the eyes of the Papuans, Pania is a "forgotten tragedy".
Poverty grows disgruntled.
Enarotali's selling rice is pathetic, and the locals can't afford it.
Bread is far from reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly potatoes and some fruit and leaves.
Cultivation is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five potatoes.
They usually use most of the harvest as writers, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten potatoes are worth 10,000 Indonesian rupees.
Over time, economic inequality has been pulled out of local Papuans and new immigrants, and the number of migrants has increased significantly since the new route to Nabyre airport has increased significantly.
The small amount of work available usually falls into the hands of better educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans rarely have funds or necessary skills to operate competitive companies.
John Gobai, President of the Pania Tribal Council, said, "Young people don't want to stay in this village because there's no job and no money here."
Papua is isolated.
In addition, the restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escodi and Basel Lungshan were deported from Papua because they were "not working with the relevant agencies", even if they had rare access to film authorization.
According to Felim Kane, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch for Asia, Zokovi withdrew the electoral vows of reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development.
In a statement, he said, "If foreign journalists try to report Papua and West Papua, the easternestly disgruntled provinces of Indonesia, they are at new risk: denial of visas and blacklists."
No media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's neighbours.
In March, 6 Pacific countries â€” Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands â€” requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate Papua ' s "general human rights violations", including the Pania shootings.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Almanata Nasir, was completely concerned about the group, and he told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still in a democratic system and media freedom, and the evidence of human rights violations is difficult to hide. "
The locals want more foreign governments to value.
According to a source, on May 4, when Dutch Human Rights Ambassador Keith Van Bar led his delegation to Chaaprah, the local people broke the silence and cried, and we wanted freedom. "He also attended the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold the next presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they're unlikely to vote again in Zokovy.
The tribal council president Gobai said, "Zokovi's intentions are good, but he's surrounded by the Pania shooting."
He wants Zokovy to know that the Paniai people live not only under the threat of greedy armies, but have nothing in the area, and that there is little education and lack public health care.
Gobai said the people of Pania thought they voted to Zokovy the votes he had to pay.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Pania shooting took their last symbolic resistance: bury a victim's body opposite the military police guard post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let the culprit forget their crimes.
Yukabbs bowed and said, "My family was killed,
What else can we do?"

The fire swallows the Dubai Torch Tower again.
On Friday, a fire was in the world's highest residential building in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee this super-high building, 337 meters, 79th floor.
This is the second fire in two years to sweep the high-rise building, which happens to be a skyscraper called the torch.
The building has been evacuated and no injuries reported, and no cause of the fire has been found.
"We're sleeping, and then we woke up and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to run off the 50th floor, "A resident named George told Reuters.
According to Dubai's civil defence authorities, the fire department extinguished the fire around 4 o'clock in local time (GMT) and was working on cooling the building.
The Government has expressed its efforts to provide shelter for affected personnel.
This accident could again raise concerns about the safety of outer wall materials in high-rise buildings around the world.
A survey conducted by the management of the Torch skyscrapers after the fire in 2015 found that most of the damaged objects were decorated and insulation of the outer wall.
The British police have indicated that they believe that the problem of the insulation and panel system of the Glenfield Building in London may have caused the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
Williams also suggested that Martha might return, although he had announced his retirement.
On January 9th, only a month left from the opening of the Pingchang Winter Olympics in Korea, the winter atmosphere in Korea was growing with the transmission of preheats from south to north and preparations.
Korean public opinion looks forward to this long-standing Korean talks that will bring a "colour egg" to the countdown of the Ping Chang Dong-O for a month.
On November 1, last year, the Ping Chang Winter Olympics arrived in Korea.
The heat of the fire is directly reflected in the sale of tickets to the Pingchang Winter Olympics.
Just more than two months ago, the sale rate of tickets for the Ping Chang Winter Olympics was only 32%, and the winter Paralympic ticket sales rate was only 4.3 per cent, and the low-profile ticket sales rate once caused the outside world to be deeply concerned about the people of the Pingchang Winter Olympics.
But as Lee Hee-fan, Chairman of the Pingchang Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, recently predicted to journalists, "As the Winter Olympics were passed all over Korea, the winter Olympics were getting hot, and believed that the sale of tickets would soon improve."
According to Korean media reports, as of 3 January, the sale of tickets to the Pingchang Winter Olympics had reached 64 per cent and the winter Paralympic ticket sales rate exceeded 50%.
In order to encourage foreigners to the Korean Games, the Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on 8th day that foreigners who would visit Korea to watch the Pingchang Winter Olympics will be extended to Korea for a maximum of 120 days.
The investigation found that over one fifth of American travellers were boarding with prohibited items.
An investigation against aircraft passengers found that over 20 per cent of passengers had deliberately or deliberately carrying illegal goods through the U.S. Transport Safety Authority checkpoint, of which at least 6 per cent of whom were not deliberately carrying prohibited knives or other blades.
Less than 1% of passengers claim that they found the wrong traffic with guns, ammunition or explosives.
This survey for over 1,000 people was conducted by the charter service company Stratos Jet Charters Inc., and the survey also found that young travellers were more openly ignoring the rules.
Of the respondents who had tried to carry TSA prohibited items deliberately, 19.7% were the millennium generation, compared to 15% of the X generation.
The most common items of TSA security officers are food and drinks.
More than 3% of the people admitted that they had deliberately carried blades for security checks, while 2.2% of women respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also indicated that they had deliberately been boarding with prohibited drugs.
The company claims that the investigation was to understand the number of passengers who had accidentally carried and deliberately carried out the aircraft board.
It's not surprising that the most likely person who's ever had an embargo - intentional or unintentional - are those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guide is a little complicated and difficult to understand.
People are usually not sure what and how much liquid can be carried.
So it's not surprising that TSA has the most seized of prohibited liquids.
It was once thought that TSA might have considered books as an embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed.
The Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Prout, changed his mind about the Obama era's emission reduction regulations.
One day after being prosecuted by 15 states, the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Prout changed his earlier delay in implementing the Obama era's decision to reduce smoke air pollution emissions.
Prout proposed this change, as the Environmental Protection Agency can respond more quickly to the needs of environmental regulatory state institutions than the previous government.
He did not mention the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former position.
The focus of the controversy is to set the deadline for the state to begin achieving the 2015 ground ozone standards on October 1.
In June, Prud announced that he would delay his performance for one year to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan to avoid "interrupting local decision-making or blocking economic growth".
Before President Donald Trump was appointed by President Donald Trump, the Attorney General of Oklahoma, has long opposed the strictization of environmental regulations.
Since arrival in Washington, Prot has repeatedly stopped or postponed regulations against the chemical and fossil fuel industry.
Wednesday's sudden reverse was a latest legal obstacle to the Prote regulatory return agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency had crossed power and tried to postpone the implementation of the Obama administration's requirements for oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Prot proposed his attitude towards ozone standards, expressing his commitment to strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency and cooperate with the states to adopt complex procedures to achieve new standards.
Prout said, " Under previous government management, the EPA usually does not meet the specified period, then wait for radical groups and others to prosecute and agree to determine the designated schedule through the agreement. " He has initiated a dozen prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, we take the deadline seriously.
We also take laws and authorities seriously. "
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Prout may again use his "extension authorization and all other legitimate authorizations" to ensure that the provisions are in line with "good policy and best available information".
Republicans in Congress are promoting a broad rewriting of the ozone layer regulations.
The House of Representatives Act approved last month aims to delay the 2015 rule for at least eight years.
This measure has not yet voted in the Senate.
New York State Attorney Eric Schneiderman led the state coalition sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this week, claiming that it intended to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said, "The reverse of the US EPA -- after we filed a lawsuit -- a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with over 11 million American communities directly affected by smoke emissions."
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Iowa, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and Columbia.
Ground ozone is formed by common pollutants from automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources that react to sunlight exposure in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths every year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered for the amazing transformation of Prout.
Lori Ann Byrd of the Biodiversity Center said, "It is disturbing that this common sense measure is under great pressure from the heads of departments who protect the air we need to breathe. "
" We must fight the idea movement of the Trump government to accommodate polluters and special interests ... "

Moor Beach tragedy: activists re-emerged racist lynching and justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car crossed a group of viewers in Monroe, Georgia, heading towards a little Moor Beach Bridge.
The car contained four black passengers and a white driver, who blocked the car's way forward before the bridge arrived.
The head of the mob -- a middle-aged man in a fine strip suit -- took a deep cigar and looked at the windshield.
The passengers in the car are full of fear.
"We want-- Roger!" The man shouted.
"and drag him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged down from the front row passenger seat and screamed to break the silence.
Fortunately, July 22nd, this terrible scene was just a re-emergence.
But when Roger's neck was covered, almost all the viewers were really breathing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moor Beach Bridge, and two black couples -- Roger and Dorothy Malcolm -- and George and Mere Dosie -- were hanged by the three K party in 1946.
No one was charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, although we saw them in the community, none of them have been arrested over the years, which is incredible," it's incredible to help organize the re-emergence of Tyron Brooks say.
"This is the stain of history, the burden of our soul."
Brooks, 71 years old, a former member of Georgia and life-long rights defenders.
For him, re-emergence was a remarkable call to remind people of the Menro community every year that injustice never was corrected.
"We want to sue, we're closing the case, we're gonna heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he says.
"Unless we have justice, we will not be cured and reconciled ... "
On July 27, 1946, the coroner was covered on the body of a Mor Beach lynching victim.
According to the FBI files obtained by the National Broadcasting Corporation News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of involvement in lynching.
But none of them were prosecuted.
Although suspects have been in a state of impunity for decades, civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for lynching is well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first election later that summer.
According to the FBI, at about the same time, black tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed white landlord Barnett Hearst in a fight -- looks like a woman.
Brooks said that the town's rumor was that Hearst slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and her baby wasn't her husband's.
The FBI claims that on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord Roy Harrison spent $600 on bail from Malcolm.
Dorothy and cousin McMerry and George Dorsey went to prison.
But when they came back from prison to the Moor Beach Bridge, a bunch of lynching thugs surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder," a FBI report concluded.
"It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, not only in murder, destruction of evidence, but also conceals the identity of the witness ... "
Brooks is very concise.
He said, "It's a voting tragedy."
"They were killed, and the killer sent a message to the black people in this community: "If you register and vote, you'll have the same ending."
For almost 10 years, Cassandra Greene has been responsible for the annual re-emergence of the Mor Beach lynching.
Her performance is very visible, with a deep racist background, and many want this racism no longer exists in the United States.
It's hard, it's harder, but Green says that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because lynching makes us face the ugly face of everyone," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me or not hear me tell my experience, I can't build a relationship with you."
This year's show started in June, with nearly 30 actors -- a dozen whites, the rest of them -- in one room, listening to Greene's rehearsal.
Wade Marbo is co-director of Green.
He's been playing the K-party for years, but he says it's never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbo said.
"But I think it's important to keep this history alive, because we don't want to go back to that time. "
In the room, the actors of Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hearst, Darios Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, are rehearsing their lines.
At the beginning of the show, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hearst and was angry with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my place!"
Rascona's back on the road.
And then they fought.
And then everyone had a laugh.
Green smiles the best.
"What's wrong?" Rascona asked.
He's scared, confused.
Did I play too much?
"No," Green smiled and said.
"I just think white people don't say "ah."
"Yes," another black actor played fun.
"Your tone must be strong."
That's it. The energy in the room has changed; the feeling of friendship drives the discomfort.
Everyone tried not only to perform this play, but also to commemorate four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, Rascona said the word "aah" and he was so sharp and powerful.
No one's laughing.
It's over with a strong and quick re-emergence.
Screams, shots, and then, a silence.
A woman in a funeral black suit stood by the actor and sang Billy Hallede's condolences, "The Strange Fruit".
Her voice has overdoing other words.
A hundred yards away, about 40 people are rubbing sweat and tears.
Blacks and white people in the audience are almost half the same.
There's a couple of people from Isaka, New York, and there's a lot of people living near the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm and Dorothy's cemetery, almost eight hours away, and everyone was suffering from Georgia's in a uncomfortable sense of wetness.
Until then, the murderer was still a fan, but now, on the same land where lynching happened, there was anxiety in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer to the bodies that the actor played.
The kids bow down, watch fake blood and bodies, whispering each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbling, as if they were reminding themselves.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the crowd and then the show is over.
Actors dump the lynching ropes and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugged Marbo, the man in the third K-head suit.
Nick Rascona hugged his colleagues and cried in their arms; the emotions in the show eventually infected him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that's not what you're inside.
You're doing this for a reason. "
After that, the audience sat down and had dinner with the actors.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta talked to a black couple they just met, talking about re-emerging.
Dennis Duprinky is hard to find a word to describe her feeling after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those terrible words and behavior that people like you say it and do it because they look like you," she said.
"It really makes me think that lynching is still going on, "She adds, "Now this is just called police shooting."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat by the table watching, tastes and re-emerging civil rights.
He said he's already planning next year's show.
"Re-emergence is an inspiring way because it describes the horror we've been through, but it's also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, this may happen again.
Those who don't study, who don't know their history are destined to repeat the same. "
For natural gas market reform, the importance of reform in the "net independence" is self-evident, but resistance and controversy are also greater.
The journalist was informed on 7 days from Hebei Kai-chul Group that an explosion occurred at 11.25 a.m. on 7 hours a.m., in the ancient metal zone of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, with 13 operators trapped.
To date, one out of 13 people trapped, one of the 13 people trapped, was rescued in a hospital, and the remaining 12 were in a tight search and rescue.
It is understood that the site is now blocked, local public security, fire, medical care, etc. are being rescued on site.
According to witnesses, it was loud, and a mushroom cloud was empty.
According to the member of the Open Group of the On-site Organization, Tangshan Kae-chung (Group) Chemical Company, located in Zhao, Dongshan City, Hebei Province, is the State-approved civilian blast equipment production company, founded in 1958, formerly the 6O2 plant of the mining authorities.

After a year and a half, Jayon finally arrived in Beijing yesterday, giving people this first work after his father, and the 14th album of his music career, "Jeren's Pre-Story Story" in his music career.
American media: Chinese Air Force Engineering University scientists study laser satellites for the removal of space waste
On January 18, the U.S. media reported that Chinese scientists have proposed a bold and innovative proposal to clean up the volatile Earth orbit with large lasers, destroying old satellites and its sky trash.
According to January 15, researchers from the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Research on the Tian-based Laser Clearing Small-scale Space Debris Transforming Model", which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers by using the space platform lasers, which can be irradiated into smaller debris, which is not so dangerous.
Reports say that space trash has been a concern for the International Space Agency for many years, and NASA has considered a variety of options to track, detect and remove artificial debris.
The way to clear large-scale space debris includes giant networks used to clean and collect waste, and magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted laser simulation studies, reaching the following conclusion that this will be an effective way to clean up Earth orbits.
The paper's summary states: " (simulation research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal technology on the T-SP platform. "
A 2014 study by the United States defence giant Lockheed-Martin found that there are about 200 threats a day for satellites operating along orbit.
High-speed debris along Earth orbits is considered a serious threat to future space missions, described by European Space Agency experts as "a deadly series of threats". Every year, high-speed debris has continued to increase.
And according to January 17th, the monthly American Journal of Mass Machine, space is basically empty, but it's getting crowded next to the Earth's space. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris that runs around the Earth, and over time, these fragments will pile up.
The more debris, the higher the chance a satellite that is still functioning is hit by debris, and then damage or destroys a millions of dollars worth of investment.
According to reports, all space agencies have developed plans to clear space trash in the future.
NASA is considering reducing the speed of debris using jet gases and get them out of orbit, and Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large network, capture debris, bringing back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electric chain.
Now, China has also proposed a solution to space trash, which is to hit floating space trash into less harmful pieces with a large laser.
According to a group of researchers from the Chinese Air Force Engineering University published a paper in the German Optical Monthly Journal, a laser will be installed on a satellite enough to clean up space effectively, at least according to the simulation.
The report states that the only way to confirm effectiveness is to test and there are no arrangements for such tasks, but maybe someone will install lasers on the satellite and send them into space sooner or later.
Once we do it, we can finally start eliminating space trash once and for all.

Updated results of the Swedish asylum age assessment test
Swedish asylummen tested the latest method to assess their age from medically, and the latest results show that over 80% of the testees were found to be over 18 years old, but not everyone believed in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Center for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmedianalverket) began the test earlier this year.
After being unable to accurately assess the age of refugees claiming underage, the Swedish Immigration Service (Migrationsverket) designed these tests to conduct more accurate age assessments during asylum.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Service has sent 6880 testers, and the Forensic Center has now published the results of a total of 2481 testers between March and 31 July 2017.
80% (2002) was determined to be 18 years or older, but in 25 other tests, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine decided that the subject of the test "may be 18 years or older".
In 432 tests, the result is that the person may be under 18 years of age.
The test is only for people who have questions of age.
According to John Grantson of the Forensic Center, these results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
He told The Local, "These data are not very different from the data of the previous few months, and the numbers are very consistent."
The higher proportion of cases determined to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that these asylummen lied to their age.
In May, the Centre published 581 test results and stated that 442 cases "which indicates that the person tested is 18 years or older".

X-ray tests of intellectual teeth, MRI scans of joints, then analysed by dentists and radiologists, which are also questioned in some areas.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, a endocrine scientist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they experience adolescence before or later than normal age.
He told the news newspaper Metro, "I have reason to think that, and I don't think the way the measurements are used.
In this way, the physical age is inaccurate.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it."
But Grantson of the Forensic Center defended the accuracy of these tests: "It is generally a very low risk of determining a child as an adult. "
The biggest risk is that this person is just under 18 years old, and this is about 10%.

What is the impact of the financial rules of the football community on Neymar's transfer to Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending at the European Haomen Football Club does not prevent Nemar from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the Paris St. German Football Club (PSG) in Paris, France.
The result is that the European Football Association Alliance (UEFA) has further downgraded the St. Germain Football Football Club in Paris.
The 2011 FIFA rules for the Financial Fair Competition mean that the Paris St. Germain Football Club must eventually prove that Nemar's transfer will be funded without causing a huge loss.
The Barcelona Club has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to pay the Brazilian player's cut-off, while Nemar's salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Nemar's transfer to France.
Considering that the team is funded from the rich Qatar rule family, the Paris St. Germain Football Club can certainly sign Nemar in cash and incorporated him into other star cloud teams.
Clubs can spend a lot of money buying players, but they have to use legitimate sources of income to compensate for the huge amount of money that they spend on football-related business.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules were proposed by Michel Platini after being elected President of FIFA in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs that are built to pursue success, if banks or everyone withdraws their support funds, they are actually cheating and putting clubs at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the Rules focused from club debt to club loss monitoring.
This change means that Roman Abramovich used the business model when buying Chelsea Club in 2003, it was to buy a potential club and then spend a huge investment to improve the team and build a global brand, now facing a more demanding situation.
In the three-year "rule" assessment period as of 2018, the club could lose 30 million euros.
Although Abu was devalued by the then President in 2015, Aleksander Ceferin, his successor, was still committed to preventing excessive spending.
Of course, the rules are not valid, and we will certainly strengthen the future regulations, and Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the Paris St. Germain Football Club will pay Nemar's buy-off terms once, it can also allocate amounts for accounting purposes within the duration of the contract.
Nemar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee may be shown at Euro44.4 million in the next five years of annual accounts.
The first wave of "rules" sanctions imposed in 2014 have given the highest sanctions to the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Manchester City Club under Abu Dhabi.
The Paris St. Germain Football Club was fined 60 million euros (US$82 million at the then exchange rate), and then reduced to 20 million euros and asked for a reduction in the team to 21 players in the 2014-15 season, not the normal 25 players.
FIFA is staring at clubs that try to increase income by linking club owners to deceive financial regulators.
Although Qatar companies can sponsor the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, if the amount of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price, FIFA will not consider it legal income.
This is what happened in 2014, and FIFA ruled that the amount of the Qatar Tourism Board sponsored the St. Germain Football Club in Paris was exaggerated.
Nemar's income from St. Germain's football club in Paris may be paid from the 2022 Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee.
But the Paris St. Germain Football Club and the organizing committee denied that Nemar would be Ambassador of the World Cup, which was easy to do such an initiative for the OSCE regulators.
The recent sanctions against the St. Germain Football Club in Paris mean that FIFA will be more vigilant about any attempt to bypass the rules.
According to Thursday, FIFA did not pre-examine the transfer of Nemar at the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.
The above-mentioned persons only contacted the Associated Press as an unknown person because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.

The accounts for the previous accounting year have not yet been published.
The Paris St. Germain Football Club predicts that Nemar's union will bring the Gospel to sponsor activities, concessions and the sale of jerseys.
The club expects to grow by at least 30 per cent of the post-end collection in Nemar.
Apparently, seeing the most famous players leave, the Spanish Union was angry, trying to block Nemar's move and claimed that the St. Germain Football Club in Paris violated the rules.
The President of the Western Jas League, Javier Tebas, told the Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of a financial stimulant" that the club and the country are the same as Qatar, which has final ownership of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.

"This is the consequence of ownership, and this has completely changed the whole ecology of football for the last 15 years " , and Winger said on Thursday.
"If the country owns a club, everything happens.
It will make it very difficult to comply with the rules, because for a country, there are many different ways or interests to require large players to represent a country."

Nostalgic infectious market -- "Hara Summer Camp" and Detective Twin Hung.
This story is to miss the age of actors in the '80s and the waste age of the 1990s (David Wayne and Michael Shuwalt for MTV before and after the sketch comedy "country"); and the memory of the nostalgia itself in 2001; before that year, many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Luther had not yet emerged.
As a cultural art, it is a imitation and expression of permanent memories of our Facebook age.
But as a series, it feels like time is not enough.
The first day of the camp was a strong reaction, but it wasn't just because of its ridiculous humor.
The play doubles the core laughs - middle-aged actors play a child at the age of real trouble - which makes it a funny part of the past.
Ten years later, adults really play adults, and they're not too deep-rooted, imitating and more scattered, including improvisation for the 1990s, like "the hand to push the cradle."
At some point, a character was trapped in an apple notebook, some straight skates and "some other things in 1991".
Many core stories are the same.
Mr. Honey is now a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie.
Victor still has a virgin.
There was another dangerous conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Shuwalt), which was abetted by George H. W. Bush.
As always, the best part of this series is interpolation.
It's particularly interesting to see this young Mr. Luther, who showed off Matt Dillon's soul patch in the movie "Singleman" and Andy in the former campus giant now feels like a giant.
This is a random crazy moment, and it might be a dynamic film, like the re-entry seven years of life, until it comes to the logical conclusion that I think is: "Hala Summer Camp: 20 years later," and its last act was to show the Cass to the premiere of the "Hala Summer Camp".
Meanwhile, Amazon's Detective Twin Hung said different nostalgia: Cold War Renaissance American Dreams, the "The City of the Cold" and even the "GLOW: The Glory Women Wrestling Alliance".
This comedy, created by Brian Gatwood and Alexandria Field, was pushed on the TV screen by director Reese Thomas: a hard-core comedy film, which was set in Romania in the 1980s, telling the story of two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheistism and Marx Leninism.
The main role - the hard Grigor and the idealist Essef - played by Florin Pierszi and Cornelius Ulich, respectively, whose dialogue was played by Chanin Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon Levit in English.
It's a wonderful idea.
But it's not just an idea.
There are some good visual twilights.
And there are many famous speakers -- including Jenny Slet, Nick O'Fman, Mahs Sarah Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevini -- built a wonderful voice event.
But Detective Twin Hung is so committed to building a loud, real propaganda comedy -- a killer in the play with a Reagan mask -- and it usually plays that role.
This six-long television is slightly dragged and comedy effects are not fast or frequent.
Detective Twin Hung is edited more stringent, and there was a better ironic effect when Gregor and Essef repeatedly visited the American embassy, because there were always two fat men in the lobby of the embassy who swallowed a bunch of burgers.

Journalists have recently interviewed that the benefits of industries such as steel, orbital traffic, ships, mechanical manufacturing in the northeast region were generally declining, and even losses.
Some experts believe that, in the current situation, the new cycle of revitalization of North-East industries is not only about the national economic recovery, but also has an impact on the long-term development of our manufacturing and international competitiveness, and therefore needs to be adjusted.
The general decline in the benefits of enterprises in traditional industries has lost and the significant decline in the manufacturing of the raw materials industry and heavy mechanical equipment, which is the primary performance of the industry in the middle-east industry in the current round.
In the economic downturn, mainly low end, primary products were affected, but in this economic volatility, high-end industrial products were affected.
The Saddle Steel Group (Weibo) started with the restructuring of the product structure, focusing on high-end plates such as container boards, steel tracks, board and civilian power plates, but the sales of these varieties have declined significantly this year, especially the sale of boardboards by 50 per cent less than last year.
The saddle steel shares (Hao Qingsoon, Director of Metallurgy, Liaoning Province, introduced that metallurgy is the third pillar industry in Liaoning, with 60 million tons of steel production in the third place in the country.
In January-May, Liaoning Province produced 21.5 million tons of crude steel, and the national policy encouraged that the production and marketing situation needed for projects with a large number of local governments, with a higher market competition and a higher decline in products, which is another feature of the Northeast manufacturing industry.

Bank of England will maintain 0.25% interest rate.
The Bank of England will announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged, and that the weak economic growth and loose inflation have broken up.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue to be weak while strengthening household income austerity while controlling interest rates.
The decision makers of the Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain 0.25% interest rates with a vote of 6-2, while a few members called for an increase of interest rates, even if weak economic growth had weakened the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced the growth projections for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6 per cent, respectively, and warned that household income austerity would continue, while inflation would rise to nearly 3 per cent in the fall.
But it indicated that in the next few years, an increase of interest rates will be required to contain inflation from de-Europeans, while borrowing costs may require a greater increase in the expectations of the financial markets.
A year ago, a year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented, and members voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the suspension of the regular financing plan and will start providing cheap funding to banks next February, although the bank claims that, according to the scheme, the Bank currently needs to add  Pound15 billion to an additional Pound15 billion.
In the record of the interest rate decision-making conference, the Bank of England stated: "In the core projections of the MPC, GDP (GDP) remain weak in the near future, as the real income austerity of households will continue to suppress consumption ... "
With regard to interest rates, the line repeatedly reiterates the need for "a certain monetary policy austerity" to suppress inflation and need to be "more" than the market expected.
The market is currently expected to achieve its first growth in the third quarter of next year, to achieve the second time in 2020.
But the line emphasizes that any increase would be slow and restrained.
The Bank ' s growth projections are declining this year and next year, compared to 1.9% and 1.7 per cent in May.
The Bank maintains a 1.8% increase in 2018.
The pound is falling from the dollar exchange rate, and the euro follows.
The pound sterling fell by 0.5% to the United States dollar, reaching 1.31, and the euro fell by 0.4 per cent to 1.11.
Before the decision to remain unchanged, the growing expectations of rising expectations were broken because of recent unoptimistic growth data.
The line says that growth in the third quarter may remain at 0.3%, although it will rise slightly at the end of the year.
General households are hit by inflation surges, while wage growth is insignificant, and the recent inflation report of the Bank of England did not give them a good news, as the line claims that austerity will become worse before they get better.
And it's called monetary policy "not to prevent the impact of income in the next few years, but wages are expected to recover at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, because of the devaluation of the pound sterling, demand for British goods has grown significantly, and the economy will be stimulating and offset some of the low consumption.
The year before the decision was set, the shocking EU referendum had dropped the pound sterling and the interest rate was down to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to have a complete impact on prices and the British economy.
Before the line announced its latest interest rate decision, the interest rate was not over the ear, because inflation had already made normal families under pressure, while three decision makers called to raise interest rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month inflation returned from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank of England claims it was expected and will rise again in the next few months.
The line is called its 2% target, and the more part is already completely weak at the end of the pound.
Andrew Monterrey, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said, "In view of the recent decline in interest rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more competitive again, because lenders strongly call for more business and look forward to a perfect sentence this year.

The British National Medical Services System (NHS) controversial HIV drugs are green.
After the High Court's dust that provided drug funding for NHS, the patient will be able to obtain "transformation" HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure preventive drugs (PrEP), a drug that could be taken before sex, has proved to reduce the risk of infection among high-risk populations by about 86 per cent. Health services will now provide the drug to 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary test.
It agreed to finance the experiment after the Court of Appeal supported the High Court's decision last year. The decision stated that, although NHS claimed that the local authorities should finance the drug, NHS had the right to pay the PrEP costs.
The move announced on Thursday was called a major new intervention by the CEO of NHS, Simon Stevens, while the National AIDS Trust Fund (NAT) described it as a "critical moment".
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first sexual health clinics registered by people. In October, more clinics will be joined, and then fully implemented in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure preventive drugs (PrEP) is a drug taken before sex to reduce HIV risk.
The experiment shows that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission of people at risk of infection.
The use of PrEP before sex means there's enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This drug can be taken two hours a day or before sex.
Those who are eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexual men, transsexuals and positive HIV carriers who have not been treated.
The clinic will determine eligible and agreed to test participants, including men, women, transgender persons and whether their sexual partner HIV infection status will be treated for unknown persons.
Persons living in England and registered general practitioners may also be enrolled in sexual health clinics in their local areas.
The plan will cost Pound10 million, while the NHS England branch signed a contract to purchase these drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The experiment aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how to locate, absorb and implement them on the basis of large samples.
Mr. Stevens said, "This major new intervention should provide a broad and increasingly successful complement and strengthening of HIV prevention.
This is another milestone in action that deserves progress in addressing the main human health challenges for over 30 years ... "
The British AIDS Trust Fund (NAT) CEO Deborah Kim said, "This is a critical moment to fight AIDS.
If it does target people in need and at risk, pre-exposure drugs provide the possibility of changing the AIDS epidemic in England.
Starting in September, the high-risk population of HIV will be funded by NHS, which has been launched in England, to obtain a new tool that can be truly implemented alone without consultation with sex partners, which will bring improvements to many people's lives.
We're in favour of this announcement. "
Ian Green, CEO of the Trentes Higgins Trust, said, "The first task is to ensure that the experiment is to be pushed rapidly throughout the country, and none of the people infected with HIV can fall.
Now we've purchased PrEP test drugs, and we're ready to protect over 10,000 high-risk people with HIV. "
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgeson claims: "After months of delay and government drag, PrEP's initial trial started very popular and should come earlier.
Evidence suggests that as part of our approach to preventing HIV and the spread of this deadly infection, what kind of change can be brought about.
This experiment will make us more aware of the advantages of PrEP.
It is important to launch this experiment throughout the country as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and help us to further end the spread of HIV in society ... "

High-quality life: applying attic and clever design to build a small apartment of the Count's Palace as a large home
Joanne Ray was a banker who was very interested in remodeling the house, and in 2014, she moved from the Grand House in the Knight Bridge to the Count's Palace apartment.
This apartment is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne-style balcony -- Joanne didn't pack and sell it, which is a strong proof of the new design.
"before that, my ex-boyfriend lived in a bigger house at the Knight Bridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for the right house with the offer.
I saw this apartment at the Count's Palace, and it's got a high ceiling.
I'd like to propose an offer that day. "
Since the first time I saw the room, this 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overhauled.
This apartment was originally a complex single room -- which needed through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- Joanne wanted to increase storage space and attic to make full use of the ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's what I asked, "She said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azadi from Duck & Shed Construction and Design Studio (in Mount Nottingham) to use this 12.5 feet tall ceiling to build a home.
The ceiling is not enough to increase two up and down space, so the building challenge is to create a high enough stand-up attic.
Elvan has to think creative so that it can solve this problem.
"The steel structure is complicated," he explained.
"We must arrange space to make it up and down and down and not need to shrugg your shoulder bow.
Not only is it as simple as building a simple platform, but also to start these steels at the right height of achieving functionality ... "
Through this arrangement, Elfan can get two high rooms in this space -- many interesting elements.
The attic uses a retrouvius brand retro-cooked window that can look over the charming area of life.
Gold furniture with mirrors, silver small furniture and Sergei Mouille retro-light laid the whole style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing atmosphere, space and light.
Put a mirror on both ends of the short corridor that makes it look longer.
In the kitchen, the splatter with mirrors is like a window to another room.
At the gates, the little grid with mirrors provides Joanne with storage space for the storage of dishes and glassware.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space that can put the kitchen away when the kitchen is not used.
The folding kitchen is not new.
But the unique thing about this folding kitchen is a garage lift door.
"This is about some engineering," Elvan explains the steel band reinforced the MDF door.
"This is the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
Because of the clever use of space and stocks, Joanne gets an extra 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, you sell the size of the house -- or your property valuation is based on the size of the house," Elvan said.
" Basically, real estate agents will walk into the room and calculate according to the size of the floor ... "
They'll try to increase the space and use of quality materials, thus bringing luxury to this space.
Elvan said, "The material is your choice and therefore helps create emotional ties at home."
"You won't love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't hold your heart."
It turns out that the standard apartment can be shaken by good design and additional area.
Actually, you might choose to live like Joanne.

Two brothers are playing $500 million in the real estate empire.
Forty years after his Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers were worth over $500 million, and one of Victoria's largest real estate empires fought for a war.
The former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lived in a mansion in the Tucara district, while the three doors were located at his brother Paul's residence, who brought him to the Supreme Court on the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has been hoping to leave the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have been arguing about the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mothers have 38 real estates worth over $500 million, which were accumulated since 1973 when the family bought Smith Street in Colin Wood.
There, the family created Westco Jeans and gradually developed it to 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold at $85 million.
The money was then put into real estate. Currently, the De Rutis family's asset portfolio includes city office buildings, Brunswick and Sorento Development Project, Gold Coast and Bler Hill Apartments, and the suburbs shopping mall.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, who was called the "main promoter and dominant figure" of his brother Paul, had about two thirds of the corporate assets, while Paul accounted for about one third.
Documents submitted to the Tribunal stated that the property value of Colin owned by $316 million, while Paul had a property value of $176 million.
Paul came to think that the division of real estate and cash was proven to be a negotiated problem.
"The proposal for the division of property by Colin left him the best property I thought " , and he wrote in a 2015 first court oath.
Last Friday, after several mediation failures, the Supreme Court held a hearing for the first time.
Now, these two brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
Colin denied it and accused Paul of being unable to manage certain real estates.
In the early oath submitted by Colin, he expressed his desire to settle the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines the most important option for the family. My Italian origin determines that the family is the most important thing."
The cost of the case is rising and there are hundreds of pages of oaths, e-mails, and company reports submitted by companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both sides.
Ms. De Rutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who started running popular restaurants and deliries since the late 1950s and bought a store in Brentrick in the early 1970s.
They bought Colinwood property with collateral, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I read three years old," where he founded Westco," and Paul was young."
Anna De Rutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to pass the property to his son in peace.
"Luggy used to say to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court " , she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the De Rutis Group, and Colin paid him $10 million when he left the company and paid $26 million to Luke.
Paul said Luke and Mark were "satisfied with their property division."
According to the biography published by the TV star Eddie McGuire to the 2015 biography, although Colin was a member of the former AFL Club, he kept low profile.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul on Friday, and their lawyers.
But only Colin responded by text... and he said, because the case was submitted to court, "I can't really say too much."
"My brother Paul chose to sue me and brought our family affairs to court, which was very, very sad " , he wrote...
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
He said, "Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I finally have such a dispute like this, and adds, he's still having hope for the settlement of the dispute."
Friday, this hope seems to be broken.
"Our problems will be resolved through court in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President's media time.
Others tried, but they all ended in failure.
John F. Kelly may really be able to do it.
If that's true, he's the first.
According to Politico, the new White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the media report, with a view to ensuring that the boss is more stable.
Here is a message taken from journalist Josh Dowsy:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly started working with senior officials on his first day, he pointed out that he was going to solve a major problem with President Trump's entry into the White House: bad information in the hands of the president."
Kelly told these officials that receiving excellent information would help the President make better decisions, so that information would require his hands â€” in writing or briefings.
Kelly's diagnosis seems to look like it, but others have tried to tame it by watching Trump's media time, but eventually ended up with failure.
President Trump's TV addiction has been a long time -- now in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still deepening.
In February, Sam Naberg, former campaign consultant, told Politico that, "If candidate Trump was frustrated by unfair reporting, then he knew that he would be very useful to have positive coverage in credible channels.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote, "In the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of controlling Trump Twitter is to ensure that he has received a certain praise in media information he receives personally. "
It's totally fine.
But Trump's Twitter habit was ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know -- that if it wasn't for their intervention, Trump's Twitter would even be more angry.
We may never know the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff can save him in the fire, even if he's only a few times, their efforts are worth it.
But no one can stop Trump from being controversial.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing groups, people promote their worldviews, and flowers drive their career by submitting reliable or unreliable information to Trump.
Politico -- all about this story -- reported in May on consultants' hobby of providing suspicious information to the President.
This is an example of the journalist Shane Goodmancher:
"The current and former Trump officials claim that Trump's reaction to negative news footage is like volcanic eruptions, especially those that are destructive information leaks, and he'll be madly trying to find out where it is.
At the end of February, there was a malicious copy of an article from the Internet inciting Charles C. Johnson website GotNews.com to the President, which accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh as the White House "the source of a lot of information leaks", and that was what Trump did.
Even if Johnson was permanently banned by Twitter for harassment, he had not provided any specific evidence, and he blew up a lot of miscontrol and later publicly denied it.
Trump read the article and started asking officials about Walsh. "
Goodmancher also said that the then Chief of Staff, Reins Pribas and White House Secretary Robert Potter, "it tried to build a system to manage and record the documents received by Trump."
And what happened?
Kelly's gonna do the same thing, three months later.
Maybe he can prove himself as an efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his assistant is still competing for influence.
These eternal influence factors make Kelly's mission difficult.

Recently, the Zhejiang Daily Press Group, hosted by the Zhejiang Daily Press Group, shared the "Sing Town x Future Artist" shared and "The Poetry Zhejiang? Town" was held at the Zhejiang Province Exhibition Museum.
"The town of the wind has the beauty of art, the temperature of life.
The town's style is the original juice, the original, the original, the original, the pure of the original ecology.
"The Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, Department of Video and Animation Arts, Director of the first-line video advertising director, Sheung-seok, and the director of the Chinese Institute of Arts and Communication, told the cross-border stories of small towns like "The Small Village Renovation of Small Villages in the Camera."
Zhejiang has a deep cultural resource, and the new town from South China City, has read the country's painting of Nancheng on the scene.
The Gangnam Water Village is popular with ancient book painters, and now Nan Yugu Town has worked in depth with art colleges like the Chinese American Academy.
The tourist town needs to be nice, tourism elements, service elements and environmental elements.
In this case, tourism services and environment are also important.
If you pass a timely umbrella in the rain, it'll make tourists better experience the town.
In this shared era, the hottest shared umbrella company, when the Zhei Group Tourism All Media Center joined forces, customised a group of shared umbrellas of the poem Zhejiang edition, hoping to advocate the concept of "shared? Green" to raise the sense of civilized tourism and public faith of tourists and small town residents, creating a good tourism environment.
This is a bright spot in the 2017 Zhejiang Touring Town promotion season.
I'm looking forward to it.
To date, Zhejiang Province has issued the first 21 provincial tourist town creation lists and 115 provincial tourist town development lists.
As a priority area for the 13th and 5th period of rural tourism, the town of Windy will eventually build a tourist view area above 3A level, becoming a new model for tourism products, with significant tourism benefits and a win-win industrial integration.
The key to the tourist town is attractive to its original juice.
The beauty of the tourist town is not only from the small bridge flow of smoke and rain, but also from a long cultural tradition; rural revitalization is derived from cultural confidence.
Throughout the International, the Dutch town of Lise, the town of Halstadt, Austria, the town of pumpkin, the French pumpkin town, is attracted at the core of tulips, salt and pumpkins, attracting a large number of tourists around the world every year, and tourism helps the small town economy.
For the town of the wind, the focus of "showing features, keeping home sorrows" gives town a clear personality and soul, and to provide cultural leaching, carrying local connections and highlights the country's civilization.
The tourist town, with cultural and home-based ties, humanities and landscapes as carriers, and then four-party tourists, allowing traditional style and culture to be inherited in shared and innovative.
Essentially, the tourist town is a complex open tourist view area, and should be shared by local and foreign tourists and residents.
As the main battleground for future tourism growth, tourist towns may not only change rural ecological face, economic and social development, but also the direction of industrial elements, but also the important force to eliminate the capital divide in urban and rural areas and awaken the recovery of rural culture.
In the wave of accelerated revitalization in the countryside, the town of Zhejiang Tourism will play a more rich and wonderful story.

RVs negotiate the ditch and return to Rich Street.
Some of the richest owners in the West Midrandz region and the determined RVs have once again, who consult on a ditch that government digs, demanding the return of land outside the mansion.
The RVs parked their 20 trailers on an empty ground outside the luxurious Soliher Street, which is called "The Rich Street".
The RVs were holding horses, hugging babies and led the RV fleet, returned again after they were expelled in May, and the city's digging out did not stop them from entering.
This smooth team found a gap in the defense line, although there was no roadblock suitable for passage, their vehicles were squeezed through the gap.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council, saying it was "very bad in dealing with this problem."
A resident who doesn't want to be famous said, "They arrived there on Monday night, before they came to Bentleyath Street and threw stones to the past passers.
The committee should be ashamed of what they did, because they were nothing to deal with the problem.
The RVs came here in May, and then they were driven away, and now they're back.
There were a lot last night, and there might be more today. "
She added, "The Birmingham City Council knows how to protect its park by implementing a long-term ban.
I live on the Streetsbrook road, and if the council can't stop this, I'm not willing to continue paying municipal taxes.
A local resident who doesn't want to reveal his name says, "This is ridiculous. We just saw a group of RVs gone, but it's easy to destroy the other batch.
This time, the number has increased, and some even saw horses eating grass on the park lawn. "
A female spokesman for the Soliher Committee said, "We know that someone has been camping on an open ground on Sjutzbrook Road, and now we work with the Soliher police and take the necessary legal action to move them away as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is important that as many local residents can report any antisocial or criminal acts to the police by calling the police.
This helps us to clarify the profile of the situation when we submit cases to the Court ... "

Italy ' s strong attitude towards the NGO Immigration Rescue Ship
Italy warned against non-governmental organizations operating immigration rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they would not continue to implement relief without signing new operational management norms.
In an interview with the Turin Daily News, Minister of the Interior, Marco Minnetti, said, "If NGOs do not sign new codes of conduct, it's hard to see what they think will continue."
On the day before Minnesota warned, the Italian official detained it for suspected that the crew of the German Aid Organization Youth Rescue was actually collated with trafficking and assisting illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operated for only one year and refused to comment on the specific subject of allegations of Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Caltocio.
In a social media statement, the organization said, "For us, saving lives is now and will be the most important thing in the future, so we regret that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at this time."
"We can only assess all allegations and situations after all information are collected ... "
Italian officials have been watching the ship of Youth Rescue since October.
Its crew was suspected of carrying the traffickers directly transported by small ships and allowed smugglers to flee and reuse the ship.
According to the prosecutor's documents, at least one such meeting occurred at sea 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, which was published by the Italian media.
Its crew was suspected of openly ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which supervised rescue operations in the area for humanitarian enthusiasm rather than any other motivation.
Under the code of conduct, ships such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer to monitor their activities on board.
Currently, of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations, only three have agreed to comply with the code of conduct, namely: Save the Children ' s Association, based at the Malthian Immigration Maritime Aid Station and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new provisions, although not necessary, were acceptable, as they did not bring any "critical changes and obstacles" to their rescue operations.
The organization who refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning doctor (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minnetti claims that the number of immigrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks shows that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast escort and the joint local mayors have begun to work.
The minister said, "We've been seeing the dawn at the end of the tunnel in recent days."
He announced the plan for the in-depth talks this month: to discuss economic development activities with the Libyan mayors and discuss with Chad, Niger and Mali how to reduce the number of immigrants who want to leave these countries to Europe.

The new North Chemical School is located in Changping Nanguchi Town, covering 1,800 acres, 40 km from the city, and is one of the priority works of Beijing to resolve non-capital functions.
The new campus is in three phases, and the current phase of construction is complete, and the second phase is expected to be fully launched at the end of this year, and the plan will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduate students, graduate students and teaching staff.
And when we looked back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and the two groups of the stars were an important part of the movie's expected audience.
Today, at 1710 hours, the 119 command center in Shaoyang City was warned to fire the tetrahydrofurans stored at the Hongxiang factory in the city of the city.
The Shunyang Fire Branch immediately sent five squadrons 20 fire trucks to the scene with heavy protective clothing, anti-cleaning vehicles, etc.

Michelle Carter was sentenced for texting Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging boyfriends to commit suicide through text messages and telephones.
Michelle Carter, 20 years old, will serve 15 months and can be transferred to probation after expiry.
Carter was convicted of unintentional non-premeditated murder of Conrad Roy in June, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the Thursday hearing, "My family is sad.
My son is my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free during the appeal.
She's facing up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyer group thinks she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
In the verdict, Carter stood up, wearing red pants and rice shirts, tight hands, tears with eyes and eyes.
"She killed Conrad Roy." The prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life for her life better.
She was not responsible " , the prosecutor said.
"She doesn't have any regret."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence, she felt very sorry."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he didn't find her "age or maturity, and even her mental illness would have any significant impact on her behavior."
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, saying, "I don't have a day to lose my beloved son.
I hope he's proud of everything I've done... and I'm trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain, and these pains will accompany us forever " , saying...
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "smuggled" because she realized she was never able to attend her brother's wedding or become his child's aunt.
"The loss of a man who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and the rest of my life will be with this pain." She said.
This case seems to have created a legal precedent, as Massachusetts law does not provide for encouraging others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found to die of carbon monoxide poisoning in the car; in this year Carter was 17 years old.
Carter's text message revealed that after she encouraged him to commit suicide, the case raised national attention.
"Standing, jumping, stabbing herself, there are many ways... "She said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family.
And the time before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You need to do it, Conrad," "All you have to do is start the generator and then get freedom and happiness."
Judge Moniz said Carter had taken attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are differences in legal opinion in this case.
There are few people defending Carter, Amanda Knox, one of them, accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and was declared innocent two years later.
In a column article published in the Los Angeles Times, Ms. Knox said, "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment."

Reporter learned from the Lassard Net Basketball Club on 2th that the Lassard Youth Team won fourth in the finals of the National Youth Basketball League in Beijing.

Automobile manufacturers are under shock. Audi will modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles.
Audi announced the day before the retrofit, the BMW said it would provide software upgrades to over 350,000 cars.
The BMW Chairman said that BMW believed that "drive more intelligent options than restrictions" means that the major European cities -- including Munich, the headquarters of the BMW company -- consider prohibiting or limiting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it would be modified to 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
No company claims to be recalled.
European automobile manufacturers have been promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emission requirements.
But nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic substances and could cause asthma.
The cost of the installation of equipment by automobile companies to offset diesel tail gas emissions is also increasing, and it is therefore difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As German auto manufacturers face censorship, Prime Minister Angela Merkel's government was accused of over-reflection of these powerful automobile companies and ignored signs of this problem.
These automobile companies are trying to avoid repeating their use of so-called failure devices, adjusting emissions in car testing to comply with the regulations and restore normal under normal driving conditions.
Several mass executives are accused of the United States, and other executives are under investigation across the Atlantic countries.
Last month, the former head of thermal mechanics in Audi Engine Research and Development was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachelo Giovani Pamio was Italian and therefore not protected by extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the public, and the German government accused Audi of installing systems to escape European emission requirements, expanding the scope of investigations that were previously limited to the United States.
Audi's investigation could have a significant impact on the public: luxury car manufacturers have a share of the disproportionate profits of Volkswagen.
A film from preparation to show, and it's common for a year or two years.
The animated film "The Great Fish Seagull" announced that it would be released on July 8th, from preparation until 12 years!
The original author of the Great Fish Seagull, 21 years old, founded the other side with his friend Zhang Chun, and won a million dollars in venture capital in 2008 and launched animated film virgins, "Big Fish Seagull".
The film has won many awards at home and abroad at the creative sample, and was recorded and praised by the French Centre for Contemporary Art in Pompido and praised as "one of the most outstanding works of art".
Because of the six years of creativity to production, the film was called the pit of millions of fans.
The Great Fish Seagull tells a story of the Chinese, and with the release of this pre-schedule, brings new expectations to all the viewers.
Liang said, "This is only done in 12 years, and now it's turned from a dream to reality, and I'm nervous and excited."
Zhang Chun said, "I'm always trying to use one fifth of the budget of others to make the same image as everyone else, and I'm driving the team crazy."
The world factory, who used to rely on material processing and a large number of common workers, is looking at high-level talent that can lead the city to reposition.

Provence lavender is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is now bad news that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is failing because of the continuous drought and the presence of insects with the virus, which makes scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Institute in Provence, said, "The lavender in Provence is facing a huge threat, as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, and spring rainfall has been significantly reduced, while the fall is raining.
It affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller individual, a leaf that can spread tiny bacteria, which will appear in very dry weather ... "
The point is that it's huge.
The elegant lavender field, in addition to attracting vacationers, lavender oil is also admired by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Chase says, "In contrast to the plants that can open many flowers, with long valleys, we have small, less developed, missing or weak.
So we have less oil."
Solutions under study include the adoption of better irrigation techniques and mitigation of evaporation of soil moisture, the spraying of clay and water protection mixtures to plant plants, and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
Compared to science fiction elements in movies, the two leading players say they're more attractive to the story of the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, Washington City journalist interviewed a number of prominent people in the world, and two performing artists, and amazingly, they were almost consistent.

Mexico is dangerous. Journalists were killed.
All employees of the Riodoce Weekly usually gather on Wednesday to review their reporting plans for the Sinaro riots, which were caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today, the shadow of tragedy is over themselves, and they gather to discuss security.
It's important that they're told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what was safer: whether they should take their children to the office (the office was attacked by grenades in 2009) or should we leave them home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals and allies.
They let these reporters name in each column -- no evidence, observation and instinct.
There are doubts about drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government list, or cartels, which are dangerous for Mexican reporting.
Violence has been intermittent, and there are more and more journalists: according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Penia Nieto took place in December 2012; 589 journalists were protected by the Federation after the attack and threat; and at least seven journalists have died in seven states so far this year.
The last one died was their editor and inspiration, and the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Waldiz Kadnas.
Valdiz wrote a lot of books about drug violence, and in one of which he wrote, "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."
You can feel he's gone, although he's everywhere -- a huge picture hanging on the front of the "Rodoce" office building, Valdiz was in the middle, with the word "Justice"; Aaron Iwala and Miriam Ramirez, who also showed his smile on his 30-year-old T-shirt, wearing glasses or his landmark Panama straw hats.
The seminar was held less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and polyseptics.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the Office sued only two.
Most of thousands of crime cases involve drug trafficking and organized crime every year, so it is rarely brought to justice the killers of journalists.
In "Ridoce," they insisted on reporting on the violence in Sinaro, although they're heartbreak, although the land is full of holes.
Ivala said that without information from the killer, without justice, it's not very useful to hold a security seminar.
He said, "It's stupid to waste time at a seminar like this.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15th, Valdiz left the "Rodoce" office in Culiakan.
His red Toyota Carola was stopped by two men only a few blocks; they forced him to get off and fired 12 guns, guessing because of the newspaper's name -- translated into the Twelve Rivers.
The criminals drove his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdiz is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two grown-ups.
Curyakan's rumors are four words.
But about Valdiz, there's actually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited the United States in January, Sinaro has become the most bloody battleground in the country, with hostile forces killing crazyly.
One or a few people are shot every day on the streets of Sinaro, and the cemetery is filled with two-storey mausoleums, which are common.
For the time being, it's time to forget that there's only one cartel that controls this beach state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even if Valdiz knew the dangers of the job, Ismail Pohoque, co-founder and director of the 60-year-old Riodoce, was guilty for not protecting his friends.
He believed that two mistakes caused this tragedy.
First, an interview with Damasso Lopez was published in February, leading a cartel group fighting several sons of Guzman.
This report may provoke these sons; the newspaper was bought by suspected gang members as soon as they were sent to the press.
The second mistake was that another newspaper that reported the same story had not been confiscated and forced Valdiz to think of leaving Mexico for his safety.
Valdiz is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great importance to Mexican violence against journalists.
His spirit is long, his friends and colleagues believe he's always with us.
In 2003, he was a senior journalist for Noroeste, who joined five colleagues to start "Rodoce" and sold $50.
Pohoqui said, "In Sinaro, "The news industry can't deal with drugs."
As time passed, the newspaper won a good reputation for bold and honest reports, and sales and advertising have increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish direct-to-attack investigations without having to worry about censorship, and readers like newspapers to publish stories that others can't tell.
"Rodoce" won the Maria Moscabo News Award five years after its inception.
The same year the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdiz International Freedom Award for his courage to pursue the most real Mexican drug coverage.
He's scared to be honest.
When the Society for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said, "I want to live."
Later in late October, he said in an interview with local television station Rompeviento TV, "In Sinaro, drug trafficking is a way of life,
You have to take on your shoulder as a journalist -- either or deaf.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done to face so much death... why are you not talking about what's happening?"
All the employees of Riodoce miss Valdiz, and miss him like a dock worker, and miss this friend who never stings and recommends, and miss this teacher who knows how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar across the office, always sitting on the same table.
Now they ask, "Is his daily habit causing his fall?"
His death also made them think about how to do their job and live.
Bohoqui said, "They don't like you to get in trouble with their women and children, and you don't like your legitimate company and the secret airport for drugs.
It's all crossed their bottom line."
The result is that even in the safest time, you have to maintain a high level of self-censoration and self-protection.
Believe in your instincts.
If you smell dangerous breath, stay away.
The editor of "Rodoce" Andres Villaril said the question was, "The breath is a feeling of being deceived and then something like Javier."
He and others said that the previous rules were no longer applicable to Sinaro -- just like it is no longer applicable to Tamullipas, Veracruz, Grero and other states, which are very profitable, while institutions are weak, government officials are corrupt, smoke.
The situation is changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees were involved in security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed; a few days ago, only sold to government spy software had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two cops were cold in the shade, avoiding the temperature of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They're from the state government to protect Riodoce's offices, in a four-storey building in the Central Class block of Culiacan.
Some reporters are joking about whether they're gonna belong to 50% of the governor's own letter.
The journalists have been in the mountains for months, where drug trafficking groups are under actual control.
The week's "Ridoce" reports three big things.
Among them were killed by the great ex-boxer Julio Cesar Chaves, a great former boxer in Sinaro.
The government funds from the governor's home town are also disclosed.
And the kidnapping in a expensive restaurant in Culiacan, which is only a block from the prosecutor's office.
The official did not issue information about the object and kidnapping process, so it needed to be careful and careful when writing what the city knew: that this restaurant was a place where drug dealers and officials loved it.
A journalist learned from the public file that the restaurant was registered under the name of the ruling Revolutionary System Party (PRI), which dominated the political classes almost throughout the previous era.
Recently, several revolutionary system governors were accused of corruption in several highly valued cases.
Veraril asked the press to write about what happened at the scene before the incident, including a son of the Mexican drug lord Guzman, who escaped the military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would look at Valdiz' column and looked for the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
46-year-old Villaril was called "skinny" because of his thin body, and he said, "We knew what was going on before.
Now all our sources of communication are strangled.
Valdiz' office is now used to store the logo and stickers of protest against the killing of journalists, because the employees became the way they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a sign out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to attend a march related to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdiz was killed in the state of Michoken in the west.
The official found a burned body and said that according to DNA tests, this is his body.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more frank, and they organize protests and paint the words "Save the media" on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, director Bohoqui is not in Washington, and he's trying to do justice for the Valdiz case and for international support.
The day after Valdiz was killed, at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaro, Ramirez accused the official spying of journalists and killed them because they told the truth.
Given her anger has affected her objectivity, she also asked to resign from government matters.
Valdiz has continued to reiterate that Mexican journalists are being organized, constricted government officials and indifferent societies.
In his last book, "Drug News", he wrote that journalists were not only disabled by drug trafficking groups, but also on the list of politicians and security forces that were contaminated with the organization of crime.
The media surveillance group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the press attacks last year to the police and public officials.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die to shut you up."
Apparently, these murders are chilling.
No one forgot six years ago, the blogger Maria Elizabeth Marcias died on the border north of Tamuras.
There's a note next to her body allegedly signed by Zetascatel: "I'm here for my story."
Her head was cut off, with a computer keyboard and headphones.
After Miloslava Brech was killed in March, some of the newspapers chose to close, like the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chivawa.
Others continue, and the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo was killed in 2014, but they were still going on.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke openly with a front-page news, entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their home or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful on the streets and be vigilant.
Sometimes they're arrested, and in 2015, photographer Rubin Espinosa was killed three months after fleeing Veracruz with four women.
For those who stay behind the scenes, it's a daily step in high-risk decision-making.
Ivala wanted to be a poet, and he admitted that he was afraid of reporting on the drug trade.
He said, "Mexico is becoming hell, so I became a journalist."
Last Friday night, the latest edition of the newspaper had been printed, and the editors of "Rodoce" sat on the walkway outside the office drinking beer, and suddenly their phones were ringing.
A series of gunfights and security forces near the beach resort city, Masatland, have confirmed 19 deaths.
The war is still being upgraded, as a series of cartel information found in the area.
They uploaded the news on the "Rodoce" site by the side of the road.
The headline of the next day had to change.
The siren was ringing nearby -- another battle for death and death in the area.
Pohoqui looked at the police standing there to guard and see if they were alert.
If they're scared, they're not showing it.
The founder of the newspaper has been killed, and in his large portrait, his middle point to the place where Sinaro needs to look, and all the staff of "Rodoce" followed his pace.
Bohoqui said, "How can you even want to close it? On the same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street for the report."
China's self-driving tourism market size or hundreds of billions of yuan in 2020
[Summary] In the context of consumption upgrading and freedom, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and a growing number of consumers.
But at the same time, the hope of breaking the trillion-scale self-drive market is also facing double challenges.
In the context of consumption upgrading and freedom, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and a growing number of consumers.
But at the same time, the hope of breaking the trillion-scale self-driving market is also facing double challenges, and the development of the self-driving industry is not comparable to market demand, and self-driving organizations such as self-drive clubs and travel agencies face a small dilemma; on the other hand, infrastructure and services facing self-drivers are also at its primary stage.
60% of the total number of people in the country, and the market size is expected to break trillions.
In 2016, 44400 million domestic tourism trips accounted for about 60 per cent of the total number of tourism in the country, and by 2020 the self-drive market is expected to exceed trillions.
According to the statistics of the Chinese Tourist Ship Association on the number of self-driving trips, the number of trips has been growing in the last five years, with the number of trips or more than half of the number of domestic tourism.
Meanwhile, the regional and national levels have shown greater attention and support for the emerging area of self-driving, and between 2016 and 2017, policy regulations related to self-driving, travel and camping tourism were intensive.
In July 2017, eight departments such as the National Tourism Authority, the National Sports Directorate, the National Sports Bureau, jointly released the Development Plan for the Development of the Automobile Self-Drive Camp; the same month, the Action Programme for the Promotion of Rural Tourism Development (2017) was highlighted in the same month.
The introduction of policies provides opportunities and policy guidance for self-drive development in the country.
The self-drive club is very profitable, and the whole chain is the key.
Although the domestic self-drive market potential is enormous and national policies are actively guided, the self-driving industry is still at its primary stage.
According to the Annual Development Report of China's Self-Drive 2016-2017, the domestic self-drive club, car club, car club, car club, etc., has reached thousands of households, but the proportion of tourists' self-help arrangements is the majority of tourists, and the proportion of tourists in various institutions such as the Friends Club, the self-drive club is about 15 per cent.
At the same time, online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies that develop self-drive products are also numerous, and many online tourism platforms sell self-driving products provided by some suppliers, and some self-drive clubs are important suppliers.
From the organization's self-drive, it covers "eat, living, living, swimming, buying, recreational" multiple aspects, high fragmentation, upper supply chain weight, and random consumption of tourists.
The founder and CEO of the Beijing Automobile Club, Lee Chongjie, believe that the self-drive club is essentially similar to travel agencies, and early major profit models are based on offline activities, with the core point of self-drive line products and leadership services.
But today, the product of the line in the field of self-driving is highly common, and the leadership service level is uneven, and the self-drive club faces the need for a new transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving is not an independent industry, but rather a cross-geographic, industry ecological circle, which is important to form a complete industrial chain.
Experts point out that experience is more important consumption, except for basic tourism consumption.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving industry, experience features should be enhanced, the development of the theme "self-drive+" and the IP of self-drive products.
The landscape is not just the road, but the car camp should not be satisfied with accommodation and accommodation.
In the face of self-driving, the basic development of self-driving is also relatively primary.
Lee Chongjie pointed out that the tourist landscape was not just a road, but needed to integrate all the elements of traffic and tourism, but the road repair and tourism were themselves responsible, and the transport sector increased tourism elements and stayed in facilities such as toilets, counselling centres, advocacy bars, and that were not very well integrated with tourism.
The experience of building is worth learning about the famous self-drive route, "The 66th Road."
Landscape design is no longer the most direct and fast path between the destination, but rather to follow the design concept of "exhaustion of driving pleasure" to provide self-driving tourists with the best enjoyment of the view of the road; the landscape can connect points, face-like tourist landscapes, both the historical and cultural values of ecological tourism resources along the line, and the organization of various thematic activities to enhance the participation and travel experience of tourists and to create economic benefits for local tourism.
In addition to the landscape, the camp is a major support facility for self-driving.
But there are few consumers who choose to stay in the camp by journalists in the New Kyoto newspaper.
They believe that many camps are biased towards infrastructure, only to satisfy eating, low-level, single product, and do not meet the need for self-driving, which contains many elements.
According to industry who do not want to reveal their names, many of the companies who were in the camp in previous years were to take the land, and after the land, the support and services were not kept up, and many of the business were in a loss, without late funding injections, and it was difficult to do some corresponding products.
Consumer groups
According to data released by the Chinese Tourist Ship Association in 2017, the self-driving group is concentrated in 21-40 years of age, especially 31-40, with a certain economic base and a high demand for personalized tourism and more for parent-child travel.
From the accommodation survey, the self-driving population is relatively more preference for non-standard accommodation.
From the self-drive type, the perimeter is the main type of self-driving, representing 84.32%.
It's a lot of people who leave the country, but it's smaller.
And as consumer demand increases, tourists who used to drive their own "visiting sites" began to change their minds, no longer "Get out of the car, sleep in the car," but more attention to the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguises to escape the enemy.
At first glance, it was terrible, but it looked like a statue.
Researchers published the first research on the size of rhinoceros found by Canadian miners, which pointed out that the fossil was preserved, so experts call it "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
This fossil is very well preserved and can even determine the color of its skin as red brown.
The story in the magazine Contemporary Biology describes it as "the most well-established armored dinosaurs ever discovered, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of knots living in the middle of the white age of 110 million to 112 million years ago.
It's very well preserved, shocked the researchers, and they described it as "real amazing."
According to the National Geographic Journal, the herb-based cape dinosaur fossils are the most well-reserved dinosaur fossils ever discovered.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered this fossil when mining the Senkol Millennium mine near McMurryburg, northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he ran into something that seemed as big as the rocks around him, and he decided to look at it carefully.
After that, the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Tyrel Museum of Biology, Canada.
It took six years to show the beast inside 2,500 pounds of earth.
After such a difficult job, the end result is now released.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," the first author of the Royal Tyrell Museum, Caleb Brown, said, "The creature is on the exhibition hall."
"It will be one of the most beautiful and preserved dinosaurs in science history - Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world."
Researchers, by studying their skin, found that this herbic creature, though wearing armor, like walking tanks, could be threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The dinosaurs in heavy armor use red and white disguise to avoid predators and use hidden techniques called "resilent" which are also used by many modern animals.
Experts say that in this way it can be better integrated with the surrounding environment, thus avoiding the enemy, which suggests that it is eaten by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, with 110 million years of history, is a member of the Zhuilong family, which became the headlines for the first time in May, and is currently being displayed at the Royal Tyrergu Biological Museum.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician, one of the team members, took 700 hours to unmask the beast's veil, and researchers now study it and named it "Borealopelta Markmitchelli".
The sample is extremely well preserved, so that Dr. Mitchell, and the international team of scientists, can record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armor on their bodies.
They found "recovery" that is a common defense in the animal world, which means that the life's back is darker than the color of its side.
Although "resilent" is common, the results found are surprising, because the dinosaurs are far more than existing animals using anti-scatters.
This dinosaur is under pressure to hunt by meat-eating dinosaurs, thus evolving in a favourable direction so that it can hide in the opposite base as a means of survival.
But most of the existing animals using anti-scatters, such as deer, zebras or thoriums, are as small and fragile as prey, which suggests that the creature is under real survival pressure.
"The mad predators of the big armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the white-skinned meat-eating dinosaurs are." Brown says.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin color is red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life clues of the creature, including the stomach content they keep to find the food that is finally eaten.
They think that dinosaurs fell into the river when they died and then washed into the sea, and eventually sank into the sea in a way down their backs.
At that time, Alberta's climate was as warm as the climate in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans could be deeper than they are now.
Brown said, "This knot dragon is really amazing because it is fully covered by the skin of the preservation and is kept in the dimensions of the dimension so far, so that its original shape can be preserved."
"So, the creature is almost the same shape as the white twilight.
You don't have to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping. "
The white age is a period of two-foot-to-foot dinosaurs on Earth.
Although the dragon is the king of dinosaurs, it only appeared millions of years after the cape dinosaur.
They include high-thorn dragons, a giant animal weighing 6 tons, 38 feet (11.5 meters).
The latest study found that scientists appeared in the magazine Contemporary Biology believed that the Dragon was washed into the sea after death, and then formed the mummies in the dirt.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink dug the creature at the Millennium mine near McMurryburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it's the world's most preserved cape dinosaur, skin and armor in the area of the nose to the hip.
This creature is about 18 feet (5 metres) and weighs 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has two 20 inches long, the tip of the shoulder.
Researchers believe that this herb cape dinosaurs are active in the present western part of Canada, and then washed into the sea by flood rivers.
But this dinosaur is buried in the sea floor to preserve its armor.
The fossil remains of this special sample are very well preserved, keeping the remaining skin still covered with a twilighted film on the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine, this level of preservation is very rare.
The more I look at it, the more I think it's incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered on the armor that is stabbed on the skull of dinosaurs.
Its right hand is on its side, five toes up.
I can count his nails. "
Journalists learned that traditional urea can be modified in the urine production process, the addition of sea algae acid, corrosive acid and amino acid-type incremental carriers to the urine production process, formed algae acid urea, zinc urin, urincin, urincin, urinin nitrogen use of urinin is increased by 5-10 percentage points.
Environmentally friendly, crop growth has a clear potential, especially large particle value-added urea, and high-quality raw materials for BB fat.
This security staff is twice as high as the security of the London Olympics in 2012.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security connection ever.
Previously, the Brazilian Government indicated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would fight in collaboration, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police officers.
Most soldiers will be responsible for defending the Olympic stadium, while 3,000 new soldiers will be responsible for security at international airports, subway stations and streets.
The police patrol the rest of the city, including subways, bus and streets.
According to the information received, 6,000 soldiers have arrived in about Olympic security services.
In addition to the four major races in charge of the Rio Olympics, they are responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic stadium.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service industry is no longer new, and it is important to make regulation more effective and non-form.
How do radicalists learn to answer that question: "Whose street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was confused.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis was sitting in the bed and looked at the Facebook net on his phone.
She accidentally found a high school student's post.
It says, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid and the kid was lying on the street."
She found that no one else posted this message on the feed, and she was confused.
One of the users of the world is constantly sending her the Dynamic Times.
Michael Brown, an unarmed black man, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He put a picture of Brown's body lying on the street, and his body was lying on the street for four hours.
"Drazy," Ferrer thought.
But death is not new to her and her community.
She dropped her phone and didn't open Twitter again that night and read the tweets about the gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There's a police video and a picture of someone who calls Brown's father, which says, "The Ferguson Police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feeder, and a cop stood in front of a group of protesters with a bark dog.
She said in another video, another cop raised his rifle screaming, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrer remembers.
"This is not what we're used to, it can be called typical murder."
I was so cold at that moment.
I was angry and I cried. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrer and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary on August 11th at the cinema, "Who's Street?"
It's a story about survival and protest, love and loss, power and resilience from the perspective of people living in this community, crowded with street alleys asking for answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter drove to Ferguson, they discussed countless times before that morning -- "On black experience and black."
"Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their faith?" She remembered.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is wrong.
I had to take her, "Felel after that.
"What happened today is the orgasm of everything in the past.
She needs to know, see and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop well in radicalism and organization, but also to understand what we have to do to be free and liberated.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with the racist experience she had not experienced, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I think I'm hurting her."
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop in a site opposite the South Florida Road police station, and the radicals waited until Officer Darren Wilson finally did not sue, the site became their camp.
Ferrer and her daughter contacted a local corporate owner who made a bag lunch.
They've prepared a bag to pass the bag to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new type of action.
She said, "My radicalism changed completely after August 9. "She was president of the Association of Minority Nurses and Health Gaps in St. Louis, Missouri State University.
"I have no organizational experience.
It's all here."
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the film co-director Sabah Fryyan during a night parade.
Fryyan said she and her photographer Lucas Alvarado Faller "just wanted to record what happened.
"Do you want to record or find a story you can use?"
This suspicion comes from many of these cases: people -- usually white -- enter a community to gain benefits from their pain and resilience.
As Fryyan explained in his latest interview, "We heard that people living in Ferguson didn't concentrate on their voices, and we wanted to do it in different ways."
Fryyan has contacted the co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for radicalism against dead prisoners.
His involvement brought Ferrell to join the "Who's Street?" project team with six other locals, and it's been a few years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary is not talking to us or talking to us, this is our statement." Davis said.
"I focus on how these characters are presented, because it's the way I'm being presented. "
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrer's experience -- but about the leader of the savior, but about community cohesion," Fryyan said -- it turns out she's the most open of the film participants.
And then, "Who's Street?" It was surprising that Ferrell's personal life, like falling in love, walking into marriage.
"I feel naked," Ferrer laughed when I first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that doing this work and humanize blacks must be a certain degree of vulnerability ... "
Moreover, Ferrer's story reiterates and repositions the role of black cool women in the wider black life campaign.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- created .BlackLives Matter on social media after the shooting of a black teenager Trevor Martin in 2012 -- was identified as cool.
"The black cool women in the leadership have generally supported the movement," Ferrell said, "That's because we're fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women must bear all this. "
Fryyan agreed and mentioned, "The movement is really supported by black women and many black cool women."
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the core of the film, but she insisted, "This is not a positive action for things."
"She's the one who inspires this energy," she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence... because in these crossroadss, as a black cool woman, you have a lot to do.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have disappeared, but tensions between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell was sentenced to more than two and a half years of probation due to attempts to block the highway during a parade.
She described the socio-political atmosphere she called home: "It's a mess."
Nevertheless, since she walked to Ferguson's streets three years ago, she's been insisting on the holy song she's tried to remember.
"We have a duty to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing but the chains on our body."
In fact, online translation services were provided on the Internet 10 years ago, and it was a long time ago on "the machine is about to translate."
Similarity: Artists use Chelsea Manning DNA to create portraits
There are many faces in the heart of the Friedman Gallery in New York: white, black and brown, each with almost undetectable similarities, and these faces are tied down from the ceiling.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning to send her cheek cotton and hair crumbs.
Manning sent hair crumbs from Livingworth prison, which was sentenced to 35 years here for leaking confidential diplomatic telegrams through WikiLeaks.
The exhibition opened on August 2nd, entitled "Specificity".
This is the result of the communication between Duwee Hagburg and Manning for two years, and Duwe Hagburg combines his disciplines with his own technology, computer science and art, and Manning is a famous dissident who was imprisoned and completed a transgender surgery in prison.
By doing algorithm analysis from Manning's DNA and created 30 portraits of the "most likely appearance." Heatherdwe Haborg made a sharp and slightly ruthless comment. His comments were both multidimensional and the concept of identity itself.
Manning was born, Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted that he was considered a woman in adolescence. He was convicted in 2013 involving 20 allegations, including six espionage violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one picture of a particle sense of black and white self-photo, and it seemed obvious, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a wig of platinum.
In 2015, Heather Duwe Haborg had a great success in her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In that work, she created a portrait of 3D characters that may be similar to 3D characters using DNA extracted from the crumbs.
That's an e-mail from PaperSmart.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait " , Heather Duwe Haborg said to the media at the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn't visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
So the artist and her imprisoned muse became an impossible pen friend, exchanged many letters with each other in two years.
They even created a comic book, "The Repressed Head," which was drawn by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book predicted that the president would allow the privilege of Manning in the future, and she could see the exhibition in prison.
And Obama asked to release her a few days after the book was published, which may be a coincidence, when Manning spent the seventh year in Kansas Military Prison.
And there is another deep idea of this exhibition, because the current United States, the Trump government has constantly declared war on government leakers and transgender soldiers, while looking for new ways that can be fired on Twitter to incite division nakedly, and this exhibition is about to bridge this division.
When asked about all this special time, Heather Duwe Haborg said, "There's a reason for anything."
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's super-large signature is below, calling for an end to the "sex, sexual orientation and culture."
It's her linear particle DNA sequence on the opposite wall, writing Cs, Gs and As symbols with pencils.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleic acid, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Duwe Haborg wants to express at least in physical structure by describing these strange portraits.
"I hope people get out of this dilemma, and our genome will not care who we are, how subjective it is, how subjective it is." Heatherdwe Haborg said his 2007 video "false memory" is also being displayed.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 of them."
The last piece of the exhibition, in one room, came from a page of the novel in the previous illustration.
It shows that soldiers in the United States are exaggerating under the amplifier, Manning.
"When they stop your speech, they win " , the wall says.
"So don't shut up."
"These are directly from a letter she wrote to me " , the artist from Philadelphia said.
"I'm afraid again, I'm still gonna say it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition himself, as predicted in the comic book, but when she did, she would be cheered by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters at the museum center.
It's also purposeful, as all the items in the exhibition, have reached the height of the genetic single group she wrote in pencils (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"I hang them on the wall in the past, but I want them to feel like a group of people." And Dewee Hagburg spoke of portraits.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just like they were protesting to release her."
Professors at Northwestern University and Oxford University employees were wanted for murder.
Police say that a man was found fatally stabbed in the luxury apartment in Chicago, and a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee was subsequently wanted and is currently looking for suspects nationwide.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Windham Lesham and Andrew Warren, 56, were arrested for murder without bail for the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Durano.
According to the document, 26-year-old Cornell Durano died of several stabbings.
Community alerts issued by Chicago Police said the body was found on July 27th.
The police arrived at Grand Plaza's apartment and found multiple cracks on the victim.
Police say Cornell Durandro died on the spot, detectives are investigating the murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lesem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cobage, Deputy Director of School Relations, stated in an e-mail statement that Lesem was now separated and banned from entering the Northwestern University campus.
Cobage said, "This is a criminal case, the authorities are investigating and the Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation."
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
In an e-mail statement, the spokesperson at the University of Oxford Summerville College said, "We have been in touch with the British police and are ready to assist the United States investigative agency as needed. "
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he could turn himself in.
Anthony Gullemi, Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, has strongly encouraged the suspect to surrender to the authorities.
Gulelmi said, "The police have a general idea of their whereabouts, and we're trying to locate possible locations."
Gullemi said that local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search of suspects.
Gulelmi said the police received a call from Grand Plaza apartment manager who just received a secret hint saying that there was a situation in apartment 1008.
Police say it was terrible.
Gulermi said it was still unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27th.
He said that according to the security camera, Lesem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Lesem has something to do with the victim," said Gulelmi.
Grand Plaza's management team issued a statement to the residents that "The police are currently studying the timeline and the background of the victim, and is investigating motivations, including a possible domestic incident. "
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said, "We will complete the road map of the World Anti-Strigger Agency in the near future."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the remaining standards for the implementation of the World Anti-Sulsive Agency (WADA) would not take long.
"The implementation of the road map standards has been implemented at a certain stage, and RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD.
The WADA road map was updated in this regard, "Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the above statement in commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Strieving Agency Road Map, which sets out the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and recently posted on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, there is nothing in the standard that could cause Russian concerns.
He added, "All has to be announced, everything will be done.
And in the near future, the results will be submitted to IOC [IOC] and WADA. "
However, one of the criteria mentioned on the list is that the Russian anti-sgon agency must publicly accept the findings of the Russian State ' s support for the use of stimulants in their national sports.
Speaking of this, Mutko said, "We're investigating, our anti-strigger system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind this, and we will not admit what doesn't exist. "
Mutco responded to the words of Vitali Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Striking Commission.
Smirov admitted the problems of the Russian anti-strigger agency in the past, while receiving access to the media earlier that day, but he added, "We have said on several occasions that the report contained controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnov says.
After the stimulant scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to perform stimulant inspections in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WFP Director General Olivia Negrie, visiting the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, said that RUSADA was "go in the right direction" to try to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it's chess or chess, defeating humans are no longer talking decades ago.
In an interview with the President of the Croatian Foot Association, Davo-Suk, said that participation in the Chinese Cup was very interesting for Croatian football, and the Chinese Cup was very large.
We don't have to find a substitute! These 8,000 products are zero customs duties.
On 11 January, a routine press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce, the Department of Commerce ' s press spokesman peaked that 15 FTAs that had been in force to date, involving 23 countries and territories, covering more than 8,000 zero tariffs imported products.
Meanwhile, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, ASEAN tropical fruit... you don't have to buy these products at a lot of money.
Currently, we have signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and territories, 15 of which have been implemented, covering over 8,000 zero tariffs.
In the case of agricultural products, as the FTAs are implemented, consumers can taste agricultural products from different places, cheap and affordable as they are implemented.
For example, tropical fruit like ASEAN durians, twigs, spark nuts, and import tariffs dropped from 15 to 30 per cent to zero tariffs.
(b) The Icelandic salmon import tariff was reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero tariffs;
(b) Alcohol in Georgia and Chile, with import tariffs reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero tariffs;
And New Zealand's specialty agricultural products like beef and milk powder have a significant tax reduction.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, the import of some of Swiss cosmetics has been reduced to zero;
(b) The import tariff on some watches reduced by 50 per cent and will be reduced to zero tariffs a few years later;
(b) The import tariff for products such as refrigerators, electric rice pots, massages, beauty machines, etc. in Korea reduced by 40 per cent and will be reduced to zero tariffs a few years later;
And there's a significant tax reduction in consumer electronics.
At the same time, zero-tariff products under the FTA include intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of domestic end consumer goods, which have contributed to some extent to the structural upgrading of consumer goods produced by the national production.
The Department of Commerce's press spokesman peaked that nearly one third of our total imports were treated with preferential tariffs on FTAs, mostly end consumer goods, which brought real benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of customs duties on imports of consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, we have adjusted the import duties for some consumer goods to further reduce the import duties on consumer goods, covering food, health care, medicines, solar products, clothing and shoe hats, domestic equipment, cultural entertainment, daily goods, etc., covering 187 8 tax numbers.
The average tax rate for this consumer will be down from 17.3 per cent to 7.7%, almost "stopping"!
As of 1 January 2018, our country has also partially adjusted other import and export tariffs.
(b) The import tariff for some cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadows, perfume, etc. decreased from 10 to 5 per cent;
After reducing tariffs, it means consumers don't have to buy for it, let alone go abroad to buy favorite foreign products.
2018 Yiu Import Shopping Festival: Importing wine, snacks, fruit... is cheap!
Foreign newspaper: American malls at the end of the year are very different.
China New Net, December 29th.
According to the American World Daily, Christmas just passed, the tide of return.
According to ABC, about half of the goods sold last Christmas were returned.
In addition, readers have been tricked on several times, and consumers need to be careful when they shop informal websites.
Generally, large shopping companies have regular, reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts or electricians from some small shops, you must be careful.
Ms. Rolandon, on December 1, local time, bought a coat on a 60-dollar dollar, and it didn't send it yet.
She sent an e-mail to the guest service, and she didn't answer.
There were other Internet users who went to the United States last year to buy a cell phone from third-party sellers, and sent it and found out it was a box of rubber mud.
When you know, you're gonna get a full refund from the website.
But there are customers who think that the website refund service is not 100% perfect.
A Chinese resident in Northern California said that he had purchased emergency distribution services twice for a website, four dollars at a time, but neither of them were sent on time.
Then I'll apply for a refund and no reply.
Large malls or shopping malls have better return policies.
Macy's is a full refund of most of the goods for 180 days.
But the goods must remain "original" and require purchase certificates such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there is no certificate, the customer can also get a mall score that can be used to buy other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general goods, and electronics usually 15 days.
However, the return of recreational goods purchased between 1 November and 25 December 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It is important to note that the 30-day refund period begins on December 25th, which is to be returned by January 25, 2018.
The great shopping experience, the new era of business shopping development.
More than a decade ago, our country was in the seller market, with limited choices and limited demand.
But after 10 years of development, the market has already achieved a shift from the seller's market to the buyer's market, and today's consumer taste has become more difficult, and they are no longer satisfied with the simple "one-hand delivery" shopping.
So how to get consumers to a very good shopping experience is the next competitive point for real estate developers.
And among the many factors affecting consumer shopping experience, the impact of shopping malls in the business community is the most significant.
See how urban builders focus on shopping experience.
There are no identical leaves in the world, and there are no two identical shopping malls, and a famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.
For example, the world-renowned Kanyon shopping mall in Turkey, whose unique wave-shaped architectural design was inspired by Canyon, and therefore, named Kanyon, walked in the walkway of the Minister of Kanyon, as if it were in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon design, there is a large elliptical performance site in the middle of the mall, unique and often performing features.
Because open platform design allows tourists to walk down at the canyon and have the effect of moving the landscape.
In the country, Nanking Forest Moore Business Street, known as China's first forest walk consumer, combines shopping with ecology, fairy tales.
7000 square metres of Green Land Square, 3,000 square metres of roof water platform, consisting of nine single-body buildings, with air galleries between buildings, designed to sink the courtyard, and the French tree above the ground is a building skin, roof water table, and creates forest-like feelings.
Walking into the forest Moore, like I accidentally fell into Alice's rabbit hole in the wonders, climbing the trunks around the grass, the springs, bringing people into a living and dynamic forest.
And in Chongqing, the Lekabin Waterworks Circle, built by Long Lake, plans to introduce more than 50 international top-level flagship stores, over 100 international top brands and over 500 well-known brands in the country and abroad, to create a business centre for the service industry, with a distinct theme.
And not only that, the Rekabin aquarium also integrates ecology into buildings, guided by TOD public transport, fashion shopping, living services, catering, entertainment, education, sports, and leading them to the unique "water culture" of Chongqing, combining shopping with water entertainment, and leisure.
It can be found that, at present, some of the housing companies have learned about the discovery of this new urban business, while industry has indicated that this consumer experience is centred on how to combine shopping with experience will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
The business circle is not just a collection of goods, but also a complex place to integrate art culture, creative themes, but also people's responsibility for urban residence.
So, while meeting the demand for one-stop material for consumers eating and drinking and buying, maximizing the multi-level spiritual needs of cultural art and to use a liveable living demand, it is necessarily a high point for future development in the business community.
In Chongqing, the North Coast of the State is located in the north of the river, near the sound bridge, the world's business, the world's business, the world's business, the world's business, the world's big, the world's big and right, the first brand, and close to international fashion.
Here is a great step, and the world is fine.
Easthara has a better shopping environment, and Dongwon is near the South Peng Business Circle, enjoying the four-storey three-storey transport system in the west and even the country, which increases the comfort of shopping.
In addition, the garden greening of the two walking streets of Hui-Tung and Wanda Square, the landscape was upgraded, planting about 300 units of Jomu, and 40,000 square metres of the site, raising the image of the South Peng Business Circle;
And the Dragon Lake One, near Chongqing's first low-density water merchant circle, surrounded by nine parks, low density and high openness, making people more willing to stay, stay, enjoy shopping, enjoy shopping, rather than being held in the back, rush to move forward and actually achieve "walk shopping".
Today's business competition will only get more intense, how to kill a blood path in a market with a serious homogeneity, taking the reputation of the future consumer's "shopping holy place" and deserves to think carefully by all real estate developers.
It's not enough to make a difference strategy alone, only if those who really put consumers in their hearts, rush consumers, and think about what consumers think, and provide consumers with a very, simple shopping experience can laugh at the market that comes in the storm.
Of course, I'd like to end up, the people of Chongqing, have such a good shopping experience and a business circle, and no one can imagine today's prosperity 10 years ago.
The festival: Consumer carnivals cover real environmental prices
168.2 billion, this is November 11, 2017, 24 hours of Skycats' Global Mardi Gras, and Skycat users consume the deal.
Specifically, after the opening of the "two 11" game, the cat's deal in three minutes exceeded $10 billion, 6 minutes and 05 seconds over $20 billion, nine hours to break 100 billion.
On this day, the total number of payments paid by consumers worldwide reached 1480 million, an increase of 41 per cent over last year.
These consumption will bring 812 million logistics orders.
And whether it's the Skycat Net buys platform or the payment platform, it belongs to the Ali Group of Ma Yun.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the single youth on November 11th, the subculture of the Light Stick Festival, created by the self-scoffing, will be compiled by electricians to become the "two 11" shopping carnival today.
On November 11, 2009, Ali Baba first used the marketing of the Light Stick Festival: no one's in love with you, so the single dogs will buy it online.
It was surprising that the deal in the treasure shop exceeded $52 million, 10 times the day-to-day trade.
Since then, the Double 11 became a shopping carnival built by Ali Baba, from the beginning of the domestic buyer's seller to the rise of global businesses, and nine years later, the Skycat's "two-one" 100 billion deal was over 3,200 times the year, making Black Friday look at the dust.
The two-one-one promotion with the Windy Cat, and a lot of electricians, of which "Kyodong" is the strongest.
Kyodong has its own shopping festival "6.18", but no "two 11" has a big impact, and this year, the cumulative sales of Kyoto reached $127.1 billion.
And after the "two 11," followed by a similar "two 12" discount, Christmas New Year's shopping.
After New Year's, waiting for Chinese consumers to buy the annual package before spring, Valentine's Day shopping, consumption, no vacation.
The environmental problems of instant mass consumption have attracted attention to professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua daily telecommunications, at least over 300,000 tons of garbage were generated during this year during the "two 11" period.
Liu Hua, Director of Pollution Prevention and Control Project, Greenpeace East Asia Division, told the Chinese-out dialogue that this year's double 11-day cat order would generate 160,000 tons of packaged garbage.
The National Postal Service issued a report in 2016, noting that the volume of fast items during the "two 11" (11-16 November) in 2015 was about 7800 million pieces, using over 3 billion knitting bags, 99.2 million packaging boxes, 1698.5 million metres of tape, and the length of tape could be around the Earth's equator 425 laps.
And this year, the National Post Office expects to have a "two 11" fast-track operation expected to exceed 1.5 billion.
Wang, the manager of a garbage burning centre in Beijing told Xinhua that after the Twin 11s were over 2,000 tons of garbage and exceeded the treatment capacity of the incineration stations.
The Express has realized that environmental pollution caused by the courier industry cannot be ignored.
Some electric logistics enterprises, including Suning, launched recycled and reused plastic delivery boxes, which can be used as a recycling bag for shopping bags and garbage bags, but not very much consumer acceptance.
Ma Yun also called on logistics to support Green Packaging and Green Logistics in Twitter.
This tweet has received more than 68,000 "excellent."
What kind of mobile payments do Germans want?
Zhang Dong Fong: The mobile payment war in Germany is not expected.
The micro-credit payment and payment treasures have moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors haven't changed, and the battle has not changed.
Where there's a place to pay for the treasure, there must be a micro-credit payment.
According to the agreement with the German e-payment service provider Wirecard, Weibo payments officially started landing in Germany in November this year and gradually set up businesses in Europe.
The foreign country of the two "olds" met again in Europe.
For a long time, paying for treasures and micro-credit payments has been singing all the way on the path of globalization.
For the globalization of mobile payments in China, Iri consulted the China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Study 2017 as follows two: one through strategic investment, experience output, equity and support foreign mobile payment enterprises.
Second, through Chinese tourists abroad, promoting mobile payment services to foreign businesses, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of mobile payments in China in foreign countries.
Indeed, the Chinese are in the world.
China's economic development, combined with the population base, is a tempting number of Chinese tourists in Europe.
But it's also destined that this China Mobile Payment Bureau, which was pulled in Germany, is not expected.
The micro-credit payment and payment treasures have moved the battlefield to Europe, the competition has not changed, the position that has not changed or changed â€” or Chinese, and is it globalization?
The more pioneering discussion is that China's mobile payments can open land in Europe?
Take Germany, for example.
It's a magic "new retail."
Chen Zheng, Yang Kai-han: Amazon announced that it would be fun to go to the military bookshop and groceries when they squeezed into 10 retailers around the world.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookshop in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened a shop in New York and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost the same time, Amazon announced that Amazon Go was piloted, and customers didn't need to line up, and they didn't need to close the books, and they didn't need to settle, and the amount of the shopping would automatically be deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
In the case of Amazon, it's been a very surprising thing that suddenly moves on the real store in recent years.
Because as early as 2007, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon would not easily open physical stores unless the following four conditions were met:
1. We must be convinced that this new opportunity will return the investment of shareholders;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great importance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4. We must be convinced that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differences.
Bookshops and grocery stores are the most shaken categories of retailing in two entities and the first to fall after the rise of Amazon.
Amazon announced that it would be fun to march into these two physical markets when they squeezed into the 10 retailers around the world.
Is the Amazon approach contrary to the guarantee in the shareholder letter?
The other end of the Earth heard similar voices. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Clouds Congress, Ma Yun, President of the Board of Directors of the Ali Baba Board, made a keynote address.
He said, "From next year, Ali Baba will no longer mention the term "e-commerce".
The era of pure electricians will soon end, and the next decade will be free of e-commerce, replacing it with "new retail".
Underline and logistics are combined to produce new retail sales ... "
In a moment, the word "new retail" was like magic, and the industry was often in the mouth.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
If it's just a line combined with the offline, the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer followed 180 largest electricians, and then estimated that the total sales of electricians were about $200 billion, compared to 25 of which accounted for more than $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 of them have been operating online in the last five years (such as Macy's department stores, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And the Ali Baba Group has $283 billion into the Suning Yun business, and he's been looking at it.
Globally, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to a full-source retail system covering physical stores, electricians, mobile and socialized media.
Is Ma Yunti's "new retail" more than a vision for the future?
If not, then what is the difference between the concept of full channels and "new retail"?
Perhaps the key to the question is not whether it's going to be integrated online and offline, but how to integrate.
Looking back at the last 20 years of retail trade, the rise of electricians as the rise of early-year discount retailers, focused on prices and convenience.
With these two pain points, the electrician moved the highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from below the line to the line.
As online consumption habits are growing and customer experience, electricians reach their tentacles to other categories and start to improve efficiency.
In the words of Ali Baba CEO Zhang Yong, " Using the Internet's ideas and technologies to reform and upgrade the total existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, making the growing consumer demand of Chinese consumers effectively met, making the entire commodity production, circulation and service process more efficient because of the Internet, the widespread use of big data. "
So the electrician's road is a light asset, a path to real heavy assets.
"Light" means that there is no traditional retail trade, such as fixed assets, staffing, management processes; "heavy" means the need for significant input in logistics, storage, etc.
The change in logistics patterns ensures the efficiency of the electrician.
According to the Chinese Government Network, Prime Minister Li Keqiang of the State Council, chaired the Standing Meeting of the State Council on 28 April, which held that expanding domestic consumption demand was an important initiative to increase domestic consumption demand.
The meeting determined that the relevant departments had to follow up their specific programmes on the basis of scientific assessments.
(a) Some of the foreign consumer demand for domestic consumers, piloting import tariffs by the end of June this year to gradually expand the scope of tax reduction commodities;
(b) Integration of tax reforms to improve consumer tax policies such as clothing, cosmetics, and to adjust the scope of taxation, tax rates and collection links;
(b) The addition and restoration of exit-free shops, rational expansion of tax-free varieties and increase a certain amount of tax-free shopping to facilitate the purchase of foreign products by domestic consumers in the country;
Further promotion of shopping clearance and tax refunds for offshore passengers and strict implementation of the tax requirements for entry items in accordance with the law.
(b) Develop a policy to support the import of cross-border electricians and to clean up unreasonable fees for import links;
Accelerate the promotion of Chinese product branding projects, supporting physical shop development and online interaction.
Regulating market order, false and false, promoting winning and bad.
Let consumers get close to comfort and shop easily.

On January 18th, Ali Baba held a summit on the electrician poverty out of poverty in Chongqing, announcing the promotion of precision from poverty and rural revitalization by exploring the new model of Internet+ poverty eradication.
This is a new "plus" after the country strategy, the launch of the rural treasure hunt project, the launch of the Farming Poverty Alleviation Platform and the establishment of the Ali Baba Poverty Eradication Fund.
The fight against poverty is one of China's most important national strategies.
Full-scale poverty eradication has never been achieved in China for thousands of years.
"The electrician poverty alleviation is an innovative round of pro-poor development and is an important catch to achieve precision poverty alleviation and precision from poverty eradication ...
The central importance and points out that the Internet can play the role of the Internet in helping to combat poverty, promote precision poverty alleviation, precision out of poverty and to bring agricultural products out of the countryside through the Internet ... "
Ali therefore introduced a rural strategy as early as 2014, with big data cloud computing and globalization and listed Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Treasures Project to recruit Village Two to lead farmers out of poverty through electricians.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to build a channel for poverty alleviation in the economy, which is currently aligned with 13 provinces and 120 national poor counties.
There are 2118 treasure-hunting villages that Ali platform have been created.
Of these, nearly 400 appear in poor counties in the province, 33 in poor counties in 13 countries.
In 2017, on the Chinese retail platform in Ali Baba, the national sales of the treasure-hunting village reached $12 billion.
Zhang Yong said that Ali has been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing, and so on, in the face of the national strategy against poverty, and that it has been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing, etc.
Among them, the village is the main carrying platform for Ali Electricians and has a new link to poverty.
In the planting chain, village and ants gold suits jointly carry out agricultural equipment and microcredit support.
In 2017, 795 ants gold suits were served in 832 poor counties, providing easy payments, credit, etc.
The rookies solve storage and logistics, Skycats are responsible for sale, and Aliyun's big data anti-feeding guides agricultural production and further improving the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of electricians not only requires products, marketing channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali offers electrician courses through the University of Treasures to teach farmers standardized, quality and scale-scale cultivation methods, and achieves a combination of "poor + mind-resilient" to make farmers sustainable out of poverty.
These courses already cover about 92 per cent of the country-level poor counties.
And the idea of "public goods, business means" also guarantees Ali's "real poverty alleviation" when poverty alleviation.
Ma Yun, Chairman of the Ali Baba Board of Directors, said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages of poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and wealth.
Poverty alleviation is a human fish, and it's a fish-defeating, rich is to build a fish pond for farmers, so that farmers have fish.
The electrician-led industry is poverty alleviation, making fish ponds.
In industrial poverty alleviation, Ali and Shaanxikawa's poverty alleviation model, have been replicated throughout the country by the relevant departments.
Ali Electrician's pro-poor work is also recognized at the decision-making level.
The electrician company, represented by Ali Baba, has been sent to ensure that farmers have increased their production gains through offline channels.
Some village and ant gold suit employees were invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of electricians out of poverty.
Currently, the China Office of the United Nations World Food Programme has been working with the village to combat poverty in the electrician industry in Anhui, etc.
The Third New Economic Think Tank Congress, organized by the Ali Institute, China Vision, was held on January 16th, and Zhang Li, Director of the Electrician Institute of the Ministry of Commerce, was attended and spoke.
She thinks that our globalization has actually ignored the most important issue, the physical and use of globalization, and the stage of globalization.
Many people think globalization has stalled, and many developed countries and developing countries have different attitudes towards globalization in the new stages, and they are different from models.
The second concept is the issue of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what is the constraints on the medium-term phase of globalization?
It is limited to the economic and environmental base because of the changing globalization of the economic base.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment by the end of 2017, will enter a new round of growth period after 2018, and the next round of growth must be activated by raw products.
The first fresh supermarket in Kyoto has recently been officially opened and plans to lay over 1,000 stores throughout the country for the next three to five years.
Plus Ali's box of horses, the super species of Yong-hyun, Su-soo, the troupe of the troupe, the new retail store started to pile up and "board" in innovative models and even prices.
The competition for fresh supermarkets has become the subject of phenomenon in the new retail field. Where is the new retail?
"We will soon enter the country in 2018, and in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou will open a lot of shops in Beijing, Shanghai. "
The box of Ma's freshman, CEO, 10, revealed the "New Play" at the Second New Retail Summit.
"From 2018, the box horse was not just a fresh electrician, but a life-type electrician that meets the immediate service of consumers.
The core model is a flow, experience, online sales... "
It's different from the traditional mall, the supermarket, the box of horses is a funny "net red shop" in many consumers, and even the broker has the concept of "box rooms".
The online electrician platform and offline retailers have advantages and disadvantages, but consumers appear in multiple channels, so both sides are trying full-source models.
Industry believes that in the context of consumption upgrading, the stores of "box horses" in 2018 will be more and more.
And the box horse has been exploring from the first birth to more consumer areas, which predicts more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
"For example, business models that attract consumers' eyeballs, and fresh supermarkets are called "
"But these relationships are too much, and it's useless, and it's not gonna work, and it's not gonna be a good experience for consumers, and I've been willing to pay. "
In the view of the joint CEO Yuan Bin, in the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and the demand for purchase has changed.
It's pure, the line is cut off, the line is going to defeat the line, and now we're holding hands together, because consumers don't have a distinction under the line.
Capital competition has made the new retail gunpowder currently represented by fresh supermarkets.
The analysis suggests that the current competition for new retailing in first-line cities is far from the Red Sea, and there are also large two-line cities to dig, and that markets still have great opportunities and space.
Different types of industries for new retail layouts will bring new retail development into a diversified state of development.
The Chinese Institute of Financial and Social Sciences, the China Institute of Social Sciences, has combed you a dry product, the annual development report of the Chinese electrician in the Sun-Dian.
What's the report card for the Chinese electrician over the year?
What are the trends in global electricians?
Let's find out for everyone.
Total sales break the record rate back to acceleration orbit.
Since 2006, our online retail sales can be said to have been growing at a hypervelocity, probably that the Internet was fresh, and it's cool to buy things without the door!
But since 2013, the rate of retail growth on the Internet began to fall to less than 50 per cent, and in 2015, the growth rate was below 40 per cent for the first time, and the growth rate in 2016 became 26.2 per cent.
But this year, it's different, and online retailing has accelerated, and in January-September this year, the increase has risen to 34.2 per cent.
Much higher than the growth rate in 2015, 2016
Maybe we're all going around and find it more pleasant to buy or buy.
Of these, retailing online goods in kind is nearly $5.8 trillion, and service online retailing is nearly $1.49 trillion.
The share of total retailing of social commodities reached 13.6 per cent, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points over the same period.
Guys, stop sleeping. Focus. The service online retail is a great success!

Help you avoid becoming the next start-up company.
Amy Erett once wanted to investigate the happiness of her e-commerce start-up company, but the investigation didn't work.
The responses are often unknown, helpless, even worse, and even more deceptive responses.
Even if she promised to use anonymous form, some employees still don't trust the process.
Erett is responsible for managing 75 people in San Francisco e-commerce hair-care company Madison Reed, who said, "the response is not consistent and objective."
So she called for help.
A new group of human resources start-ups emerged like a spring after the rain to help companies understand how their employees feel.
They build and authorize software dedicated to measuring staff participation, thus allowing companies to conduct quick public opinion tests against specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees and in some cases allowing whistleblowers to bypass the executives to report directly to the board.
"Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company Fitbit?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Redwood Enterprise, Glint, said that the Glint software analysis tool was used by companies to measure staff professionalism.
Erett said she had more insight into the staff's thoughts and feelings with Glint in three years.
In addition to the rapid investigation and poll of specific teams, Glint also provides company hot maps, which units have the highest number of complaints, which managers approve low scores and see them -- which allows her to understand the reasons.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must be skilled in controlling the company's career culture so that they have not become the next step. A blog post before the employees described the harassment environment, which were punished by the company and then got into a scandal.
For start-ups like Glint, the company's oversight wish is a business opportunity for money.
According to the financial technology analysis website Let's Talk Payments, global governance, regulatory and compliance industries may be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a start-up company in Denver, Colorado, was dedicated to helping companies prevent and discover bad behavior, and during the loss of reputation earlier this year, they saw an increase in interest and activity.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Abby, Microsoft and Tesla.
Yu-soo recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent can send custom-made "diagnosis" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and look at the heat maps of their problem area.
Convercent also provides anonymous text messages to report bad behavior by employees.
If the chairman is involved, the complaint will be directly on the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent, said, "The Court of Public Opinion has tampered with the authority of the regulatory body.
If a company is found to be poor or immoral to employees, even if regulators do not intervene, the company may face the high consequences of consumer resistance, loss of employees and involvement in litigation, Quinlan says.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain across over 500 places and over 25,000 employees, has used Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees understand the rules of work and work, providing easy access to the company's headquarters.
Before that, if the employee wants to report the problem, you must find the company's headquarters phone number or e-mail, make a formal complaint and hope that Headquarters will take it seriously.
It's often a fearsome and disturbing experience, as Ruby Tuesday's legal adviser James Vitrano said he thought there was no good way to track complaints from employees.
But now the company uses Convercent to find and solve problems that were not known by executives in remote offices, cities or states -- such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wages.
"I can learn more closely, 360 degrees full of work experience," says Vitrano of Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation. "
Quinlan said that after the Andorran accounting firm collapsed in violation of moral norms by the Anan scandal, companies have been more interested in ethics, values and staff professionalism since 2002.
But it was not until "social media into their own world," companies realized that they couldn't stop their explosions from spreading online viruses.
"before using technology to monitor morality, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Glint and Convercent both provide their software as services and charge companies with recurrent fees for product use.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture capitalists who have supported the two start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with total capital rising to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessmer Venture Partners, with a total funding of $6 million.
Given the interlinkages between companies, culture and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
More and more research shows that today's employees have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In markets like Silicon Valley, high pay and interesting projects are just bets.
The employees want to feel they're accepted, valued, felt their time spent on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel their voices being heard, their work is useful, and they will be more committed to making the company succeed," LinkedIn, Vice President Nina McCartney, said LinkedIn, also using Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when employees are loyal and professional.
If third-party analysis tools promise to increase staff loyalty and professionalism, they'll find financial support.
According to workplace cultural experts, it is important to have data on staff professionalism.
But unless the company's administrator takes action, these data are useless.
In fact, if a company requires feedback from employees, the company can be expected to be changing.
If change is not moving fast enough, or without a little progress, it may bring disappointment and lead employees to leave the company.
Russell Ruth, the consulting director of the business management company Kurt International, said, "If you want to seek 4000 suggestions, you need to be ready to conduct 4000 conversations. "He's seen some companies over-reliance on data collection errors.
"Because if you don't follow up, the staff will think, "Did you really hear what I said?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care?"
Erett says Madison Reed is now conducting a monthly employee survey and has been able to take action on the day Glint reported the problem.
After collecting feedback from staff on their setbacks because of the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing the internal team of the company and increased communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is getting new insights into its employees, and in the long run, they want to be able to make a shift in this industry known as high talent loss to better retain their employees.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you'll lose your talent," Vitrano says.
"If you lose your talent, you'll lose your client.
And when you lose your client, you lose the company."

NCAA cancelled training twice a day and extended the day of the Bears.
At 11:00 p.m., UCLA football team members wandered around the team's new campus practice field.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts and showed up the first day of the camp who worked hard to train and sweat their backs.
For a large number of people on the team, this free minutes is a break.
The players who took the summer course will return to the final exam in the dormitory after three hours, and then the next morning, they return to the Wasserman football center to the meeting.
"The next three days is a grinding of these guys," the bear coach Jim Mora said on Monday on Tuesday.
NCAA cancelled two exercises a day (to reduce the burden of players), but actually extended their day training time - at least before Friday.
That's why the first three trainings at UCLA are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to adapt to the schedule of players who have been squeezed.
From the cancellation of training twice a day to more training, the Bears trained almost a week before the last season, and Mora trained at summer school in six seasons in Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions on August 20th, and then they're preparing for the official competition for Texas farmers in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA rule adjustment, although it would add another project to the busy journey of the players.
"In three or four days, we'll give them a huge amount of training, very challenging," Mora said.
"They just passed through... they're grinding, they're all great kids.
I think by Saturday, we'll have more time, really great."
As soon as the camp ends, UCLA will stop training. Given the clear view of the nearby parking lot and Luskin Center, it's not an easy task.
From this weekend, the Bears will be staying at the hotel, but Mora admits that once these rooms are empty in the season, there may be problems.
"We'll take security," Mora said.
"It's a really worrying question... that someone might rent a room and sit in the room to record the training scene, which is not far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures in parking lot 8.
We'll use the resources we can do the best.
I'm not worried too much about that.
We've made plans. "

Facebook will launch a fact-checking function to combat false news.
Facebook claims on Thursday that more potential prank articles will be sent to third-party testing agencies and to show the results below the original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network is trying to combat the so-called false news.
Facebook stated in its statement on its website that Facebook would start using updated machines to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to fact-checkers and may show the results of the facts under the post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main sources of the so-called false news, and many people thought Facebook affected the 2016 presidential election.
This problem has also become a major political topic in Europe, where voters suffered a false story before the May presidential election, Germany took the lead in support of the fine scheme before the September election, which would be fined if social media networks failed to remove hate posts in time.

Create a drawing novel: the story of the Castle of England.
Recently, the little Scottney Castle became the lead in a compressed music film and once became a refuge for Mrs. Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s.
But Scottney witnessed 700 years of turmoil in a comfortable position of the Bayer Valley in Kent, and now it is an inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes.
"You can see the handwriting of the ancients 300 years ago, and I found it beautiful." He said with his eyes.
"What kind of human character is to leave this letter in my hands."
Crossing the Middle Ages until Edward, the book of the "A Castle of England" records the families living in Scottney, each of which is different by British future artists like Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book on the archives as a raw material: he also wrote "The teeth and other stories of the dead in 2014, a book inspired by the British Library literature, a work he's done with uncontrollable creative passion.
He said, "I saw the thumb mark on the side of the letter that was unstoppable, written by a double agent working for Jacobs in the 18th century."
"That's his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke, because then you need to light the light.
For us 300 years later, it makes you feel like they're with us.
Oh, I like the archives!"
For those who were moved by old paper, they could get the support of the England National Trust and Arts Commission and lived in the castle for almost four months.
Roz spent days visiting Victoria's New Castle, reading files, studying many treasures and ancient games in the estate, like the hyenas hanging on the wall, and the bottles that spent centuries in the city.
He walks on the land and ruins of the old castle, with the homeless, gardeners, sometimes talking to the artist who drew illustrations for his book.
And then at night, he'll have a little whiskey and write."
Scottney's secret history is not clear, because the National Trust will only enter after Elizabeth Hersi, the last heir in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff started processing the files, and he described them as "the nobles were leaving hundreds of years ago: "Oh, put it in the attic."
The diary, letters from the British Empire, depicts the map of the borders of all nations: "You'll think land disputes are boring." Roz says, "But there will be two families who will fight for a white tree.
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in this work, which begin with castles, have led to a broader level of research on the history of England, including The Laborer, which leads by a man who left the new castle to participate in the 1381 farmer uprising.
The story of the book, "Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex" records a riot that happened in the castle in 1380." Rhodes said.
"The farmer's uprising began in that area, and I think it's a good place to start the uprising.
Maybe these two are connected?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Prince, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest during British religious reform for seven years.
Or The Smuggler, the story was the 18th century smuggler, Arthur Darrell, who was considered to be a funeral for himself by filling a coffin with stones.
The Darrells is the favorite Scottney Castle family in Rhodes: "These gentlemen seem to be scoundrel, always borrowing money and pay for what they can't afford.
A generation of Darrell men solve their debt problems by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be a bunch of handsome boys who know how to pursue women. "
As his mission ended in the castle, Rhodes began looking for other strange writing experiences.
He finished a drawing novel in the wilderness of Finland for two weeks, about "El?m?nm?nm?nm?
But Scottney has a special position for him.
"I left sadly," he said.
"It's like: 'Oh, I have to face the real life of the slurry."

The big energy companies are all "rich and enemy" and who's the best of the many energy companies around the world?
Yesterday, the famous PFC Energy Corporation announced the 50th ranking of the listed energy company in 2011, and the United States oil and gas producer Exxon-Mexon, a market value of $46.3 billion, followed by the Chinese Oil and Royal Dutch Shells.
In this list of the PFC, Chinese oil was twice in 2007 and 2009, and the top of the other year was occupied by Exxon Mefu.
Of the 50th list in 2011, three companies from the mainland of China were in the middle of China, in addition to the second-ranked Chinese oil, with the ninth Chinese petrochemical and 15th place of Chinese marine oil.
According to PFC, however, although the current oil prices are far higher than four years ago, the CEO of the PFC Energy Corporation stated that there were many reasons for the low market value, including the decline in North American gas prices and low activity in the global stock market.

The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both houses.
The American media quoted Trump saying, "This law will reduce poverty and raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars and achieve these benefits by changing the distribution of green cards to citizens of the United States to other countries.
The law will replace the current programme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process contributes to speaking English, financial support and has applicants who are beneficial to economic development ... "

And in 2017, Zhao Ray Tan said, "After next year's tour, I want to clean myself up and sink and write more new works."
To optimize the landscape environment, build beautiful South China, recently, the South China Tobacco Special (sub-company) "636" volunteer team conducted a "mounting forest, home-friendly" environmental campaign.
The event was not only supported by all the staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired old cadres, and their families were involved in environmental practices, and the young and young were working together, climbing the forest, cleaning up the garbage, and gave their own strength to build the beautiful South.
The volunteer campaign aims to protect the South Landscape Resources and promote the concept of volunteerism "Care for others, Care for Society, Care for Nature" and to allow the next generation to accept Kao-tao from childhood to pass on volunteer virtue.
According to the information received, since its inception in early April this year, 16 development members have been developing members, and has launched a series of volunteer activities such as smoking farmers to care tobacco leaves, Yaan earthquake love donations, and become a volunteer force that transmits positive energy with heart.

Sex robots are rising, but we should be careful.
Just as you don't think it's weirder in 2017, a new technology development report in the field of sex robots.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the Responsible Robot Foundation (FRR) released a report that looks forward to the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Shaki, a retired professor of robotic technology and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the nipple shape and the type of nails.
Shaggy said in the new report, "People laugh behind the back, but the major companies did launch a lot of sex robots, and we'll see more."
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots, with silicone skin, touching warm and deliberately using artificial intelligence to set up human sexual reactions.
Users can also "defined" their robots to satisfy their preferences, from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But even more disturbing, many robots with personality make "repeated wife" look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can come from definitions, such as shyness, based on the characteristics that users think are attractive.
And the Roxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, which pre-set character features, including a slightly shy "cold Fara" and "The Wild Wendy of Adventure".
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that is as much as you can," and True Companion's website is happy about this.
So she loves you, evil.
She had a little mood like normal people in those days!
She can be lazy, talkable, she can be "sexually strong"!
The rise of sex robots has caused a lot of anxiety -- not just replacing real human relationships -- but also the female characteristics of low-key knees and the hint of rape that pulls in cold (read: resistance) Fara is the most worrying.
True Companion compares Roxxy as a man's vibrating stick on his website.
The site says, "If a woman has a vibrating stick, why can't a man have Roxxy?"
But these sex robots are not a simple love, not just a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing maturity refer to the darker, deeper part of our culture: from perfect gender equality to sex with submissive options.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and although FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the edge of consumer culture.
But what's coming from the edge can show us the process of the time we're in.
Many people are not weird and aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to become so.
These fine sex robots appear in an era of threat to women's rights around the world, and the White House and a president bra bragging about sexual violence against women, which is not a coincidence.
The most chilling part of the TV show "The story of a woman" is not the real picture, not the hanging body, not the ones that were dug out, but the real imagination.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but it doesn't look far away now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to do everything possible to create the most real woman's body (although in the proportion of porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and imitate real human movements.
But frankly, their personality doesn't represent real women.
They can't break up, they can't run away.
They have no help agencies, no follow-up stories, no independence at all, no possibility of breaking the complete slavery fantasy.
In other words, they're fun slaves.
Or according to the general term of 2017, the woman.
The Great Wall tells the story of the death and death of the monster in ancient times to defend humanity to defend humanity.
The last issue of the fourth season of the fourth season of the "Run-Man" has been recorded, and the "Runny Man" was recorded, and Deng gave the audience a micro-mail interview with Shenyang's journalist, from the "Runboy" to "The Ghost of the Bad Man" to "The Bad Man" Chen Moe, and Deng gave the audience to the audience, and it's changing.
Deng said, "In the show, I wouldn't do the same thing, to keep updating."
The great work of Trump?
Make Mitt Romney a microcosm of common sense.
Political differences bring about polarization of American voters, and from a micro-point point of view, it destroys American family harmony, which is already weird for the Trump era.
Before Christmas and Thanksgiving, the major American newspapers were filled with the fear of how to vote for the Trump relatives.
Usually, we're doing everything we can to break our filter foam.
Less comment is Trump's power to bring their families together.
I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who was in a long time with the Republicans in our house, and he was coming to New York to visit me this week.
She reminded me that united against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Because of working with Trump in the White House, all she knew, even Republican relatives who had been arguing for decades, are suddenly and strangely on the same front.
If it's all at the table, it's certainly a good thing, but what shocked me is that, from a broader perspective, it's a major risk.
Although the left character has been encouraged by Trump, the warp effect of his presidency drives us all to turn right.
When we talk about normalization and Trump, the possibility of concern is that his weird behavior may stop one day.
However, there is a more worrying long-term scene that Trump's "normalization" is a relationship with right-wing Republicans who had previously opposed Mr. President's standards, and now suddenly seems to be a symbol of reason.
I found myself a little bit of a fan of the Mitt Romney version: 14 percent of the income tax on the car (but at least we know his tax returns), which seems to be too minor compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate had to be rationally qualified for immeasurable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took our kids to the carous horse in New York Park, the largest rotating horse run by the New York Central Park Management Department, and if you don't need coffee, you're the most consumer in this city.
The sound of the horse is as big as thunder, and the central cylinder is designed for glass fibres, all clowns and animals twist their heads, terror and evil looking at their shoulders, and the music is strangely ringing as a loud music.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: the landscape that looks over the high-rise building has become old, and the skyline becomes too familiar to provide too much excitement, and the reality of the city does not support dreams.
Thirty-five years later, I haven't completely forgotten that that the Swiss cabin was not a Swiss cabin, but a great Swiss cabin at the theme bar, and I can't remember, but near a intersection in northern London.
However, the carous horse in Central Park is still a magical experience, and everyone has fun for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four 40-year-old girls.
If I could judge the spinning horse, I'd give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before I brushing my credit card, I was asked to score my deal experience one to five stars.
The same goes to the coffee shop in my street corner, and you can choose to score 15% tip, which is to buy on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down the speed of neutral transactions, but also putting pressure on the waiter, adding personal factors to the unnecessary scenario.
The poor woman in this department store smiled, and I was tired, and the credit card trading experience gave her five stars.
Oscar Pistolis transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain.

On May 18th, the Ministry of Finance announced the Management of the Special Award for the Adjustment of Industrial Enterprise Structures, which will arrange a special award to facilitate the reduction of coal and steel overcapacity, with a total amount of $100 billion.
Recently, many local governments, such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Heilong River, have recently presented a reform of overcapacity.
Many of them even suggested that central finance support for its province are actively seeking financial support for its province.
One proof is that coal de-capacity targets published in only eight provinces stand to 90% of the national coal reduction program.
In an interview with the journalist, Lin Boqiang, President of the Chinese Institute of Energy Policy at Xiamen University, believes that the steel and coal industries rely on 100 billion yuan in the center, and that more funding requires local governments and businesses to solve it. How can we solve it?
The recent rules for the implementation of coal decapacity in Shanxi Province proposed the restructuring of the Shanxi Coal Group into state-owned capital investment companies, to integrate the assets and operations of the enterprise and to build a new business model.
The actual funding gap may be three times more than the subsidy, the Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, Yoon Umin, said that the initial statistics on "de-capacity" was 1.3 million employees, and the steel system was 500,000.
Reporter of the Southern Daily News (Reporter/Sheqingyu) was informed today from the Provincial Environmental Protection Department that the results of the Guangdong Province ' s environmental protection credit rating are being announced in 2012.

Does meat, dairy products and chocolate help to alleviate inflammation intestinal disease (IBD)?
The meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmare of your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: diet with meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammation.
The infertility has a life impact of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British, leading to stomach spasms and abdominal swelling, recurrent or bleeding diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington usually suggest that patients avoid eating meat and dairy products to mitigate symptoms, but researchers find that key amino acid-colour amino acid-colour amino acid acid in proteins helps to promote immune cell growth, which increase the resistance of the intestinal tract.
Dr. Marco Colonna, the chief researcher, explained that immunocells patrol in the intestinal tract to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not quietly enter the body.
The cells that cause inflammation remain balanced between cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body without damage to sensitive and fragile tissues.
When balance is too biased, inflammation can occur.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunity was found in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need color amino acid (one of the components of protein) to form the appearance of cells.
Professor Colona said, "We have a link between a bacterial species (the normal part of the intestinal microbiology) and the development of the resistant cell population.
The more color amino acid in the diet, the more immune cells they are.
He suggested that if humans use the same method, the combination of the lactation bacteria and the diet with colored amino acid could create a more resistant and less inflammation intestinal environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Baraganwas studied an immune cell that can enhance resilience when she found a group of cells that studied mice had such cells, but the other same strain was raised separately.
She suspects that this difference is related to the intestinal microorganisms of mice.
DNA sequencing of mice' cholesterol, and six bacterial stocks are found in mice with immunocells, but not in mice without immunocells.
Rats are raised in sterile environments, so they lack intestinal microorganisms and do not appear in this immunocell, and there is a ludicrous bacteria that produce immunocells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers nurture the lullella in liquids and then transfer a small amount of bacterial-free liquids to premature immunocells separated from mice.
The immunocell developed into a resistant cell.
When pure the active ingredient from liquids, it can prove that the active ingredient is a by-product of the chromosomate metabolism, known as thorium-3-emulsic acid.
When researchers double the number of color amino acid in mouse feed, the number of cells has increased by about 50%, but when color amino acid levels are halved, the number of cells is halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people, like rats, have the same resistance cells, most of us have the same resilient cells in our gastrointestinal tracts.
Is humans able to induce cell development as a mouse in the experiment to induce cell growth from the by-products of the luctella bacteria, but the genetic defects associated with chromosomates are found in inflammation intestinal patients.
She said, "The development of these cells may be the result we want, because these cells control the inflammation reaction on the internal surface of the intestinal tract.
It can be inaccurate that high-level color amino acid exists in the Lucella can lead to an increase in the number of bacteria.
JosÃ© Mulligno thinks the United has signed the Genius Nemania Matitch.
Wednesday night, after the first appearance of Netanyahu's fight, Mulligno decided that the United signed a "genius" mid-field player.
Matitch, from Chelsea, signed up to 40 million pounds, played 2-1 in Dublin's last pre-season pre-season game before the Royal Madrid European Super Bowl, winning Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira on Tuesday.
However, in the Asian Tour of Bruce's pre-season, Matic was in a state of severe condition, and only 45 minutes was completed, Mulligno admitted that it needed to be improved before the British super-season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and genius thinking -- he thinks football," Mulligno said.
"We'll help him prepare as soon as possible."
Murigno started his first launch at the beginning of the season, and like Matitch, the new signatories Victor Linderov and Romelu Lucaku started a game at the Injehua Stadium.
The independent newspaper reported this week that Mulligno still wanted to introduce three more signatories, but he insisted that the club was "work great," and he had four preferred contractors in his heart, and the club had introduced three of them.
"The club introduced three of the signatories, and I appreciate it." He added.
"If the club could introduce all four players, I'd be happier, but they've done a lot for me. "
Will China fall behind if China does not build this ship?
As the world's major naval powers recently announced a new plan for the construction of frigates, as if overnight the frigate had the focus of the major powers Navy, first Japan identified the procurement of two new frigates in the 2018 defence budget, which led to a substantial breakthrough in the Japanese DEX frigate project, and then the latest programme of the United States Lockheed Martin recently released the United States FFFG frigate program, and where would China's new frigates go?
With the water of the latest 054A frigate in late 2017, marked the construction of up to 29 of the 054A frigates, approaching the sum of the 053H series of frigates, while the construction of the 054A has been built for 12 years since 2006, the construction of 054A has been built for 12 years, even within the world, with such a large number of high-performance general frigates, except China, only the United States had built in the 7th and 1980s.
And the reason why so many 054As are simple, that's good, good, useful, plus the Navy's debt for years.
The 054A frigates have been popular with high value and good combat forces for many years, with about 4,000 tons of drainage, carrying a 76 mm main cannon, 32 units of red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missile co-launching systems, 8 eagles hit 83 and a direct-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and designed a ship earlier, its combat power was not too bad today, and it could see medium levels in the world's frigate.
But this is a ship designed at the beginning of the 21st century, with weapons on the side, and its power systems and electronic radar equipment are already very different from the current world ' s mainstream frigates, like Europe's same type frigates have been equipped with full power, small multifunctional phase-controlled radars, large-sized helicopter decks, and it's time to develop a new model.
So how China's new frigate should develop, which is directly related to its future positioning and our Chinese Navy's strategic approach.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will be completely blue water navy, and the future will be going to the ocean, with rapid deployments in areas associated with China's interest, demonstrating the existence of force, and if necessary, strong fighting to ensure that Chinaâ€™s interests in the region are not damaged, so that the new Hu Weijiang will be large and oceanized.
And look at the location of the new frigate in future Chinese naval sequences, and the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the United States Navy, and other main ships will form a carrier or amphibious attack vessel as required.
The role of new frigates should be the position of anti-submarine main and medium-near areas in future carrier combat groups, and should act as a frigate ship class in the amphibious attack vessel strike group, so that new frigates must have strong anti-submarine and good medium-range air release capabilities, as required.
Based on the above-mentioned positioning, it's a bold idea of the possibility of the future national frigate.
First, the drainage will have a significant increase in the current 054A frigate, estimated that the new frigate will reach about 5,000-6000 tons; the power system will use an integrated power propulsion system of QC280 improved gas turbines and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed of about 30 knots, and the continuation will increase significantly; as for the configuration of 76 mm main guns and 1130 close guns should be retained, but an additional red flag 10 launch system, with a 32-48 unit red flag 16 improvement and fish-8 hair-relaying system, which should be used in the back of the ship, which should be used to launch eagle 18 and new cruise missiles; the storage and docking platform should be increased, similar to the high-level radar system, which should be used for the launch of eagles 18 and new cruise missiles; and the platform will be increased, with two tons of high-level radars; and the high-level radar system should be used for the launch of eagles 18 and new cruise missiles; and the platform will be increased to a large-scale radar system based on high-level radar systems, and the high-level radar system, which should be used for the launch of eagles 18 and new cruise missiles; and the platform and the platform would be increased to a high level of a high-level radar system, and a high-level air control system, which should be used for the launch of eagles 18 and a new cruise missile;
So the overall level of the new frigate will reach the world's top level, even compared to the US FPG.
Of course, the concept is just a guess of the new national frigate, and how we can only wait until the new frigate is in the water, let's look forward to it.

In recent years, our city has encouraged enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national, industry standards and regional group standards, giving 300,000 dollars to enterprises that are the main or participating in the development of the Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and the award of $500,000 for enterprises certified through Zhejiang, which is the highest amount of the award in the province, which inspires the enthusiasm for the participation of enterprises in the bid.
The Wang Li Group Production Workshop, the head of the group's system, was packing a security door seal with his staff as a sample of participation in the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard for the marking of the standard for the markings and is ready to send it to the Sau Xing Quality Testing Centre.
Just two days ago, Wang Li has passed the field review of the Zhejiang Manufacturing Certification Group.
He said that a professional team of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations praised the group ' s achievements in the core of quality excellence, autonomous innovation, and agreed that, as long as the product was tested, Wang Li will be one of the first enterprises to pass through that standard.
Wang Li Group is just a microcosm of standard-scattering industrial transformation.

China's family debt rate is close to the United States.
In recent times, everyone has been discussing the recent changes in real estate policy, whether the real estate policy is to be untieed? Will the diversification of land policy supply subjects be reduced?
But when we worry about real estate prices, fear macroeconomic regulation and fear future trends in the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again, and last time we talked about the People's Daily comment on real estate regulation, and now the People's Daily is a more serious topic than buying a house that can't buy a house.
Today, we'll talk about the more serious question than buying a house: the loan.
First, China's growing housing debt crisis
According to the data in the text, the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Institute of Social Sciences, the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the National Assets and Development Centre of the National Assets Sheet Research Centre stated that the population sector leverage rate continued to continue to rise, from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2017, an increase of 1.3 percentage points, rising by 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The debt share of the population sector in the entire real economy has increased and the leverage rate is rising faster.
Research shows that Chinese households ' liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, or about two thirds of the population's liabilities, about twice as much as business loans.
Of these, in consumer loans, housing loans are about 80%, but short-term consumption loans are growing faster, higher than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition to this, the domestic debt rate in China has only counted the total amount of credit obtained by the family sector from financial institutions, while Chinese families have a number of private borrowing, including borrowing money from relatives and friends, with large-scale hidden debt.
Seeing such data, there are some obscurities that, according to the Suning Financial Institute statistics, the leverage rate of Chinese residents in 1996 was only 3 per cent, and only 18 per cent in 2008, but the rate of the population has begun to grow rapidly since 2008, doubleed in just six years, reaching 36.4 per cent. The number of people ' s leverage has been up to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2017.
We compare another data, last May, HSBC released a survey report across nine countries, near tens of thousands of people.
The report was visited by young people in nine countries (born 1980-2000).
The report states that young people ' s housing ownership rate after 80, 90 years later, leading the second Mexico (46 per cent) far away and twice as high as the United States indicator (35 per cent).
These data tell us a very likely problem, which is that the largest potential "gre rhinoceros" of Chinese residents at this stage are estimated to be unable to pay off their debts.
Second, why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we had previously analysed, while we've been saying that China's house prices are high, China's housing ownership is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world, so I'm afraid you have to ask a lot of friends now.
We look at the real estate market around the world, China's real estate market, because of the late start, and there has not been a large real estate crisis in addition to what we said earlier, but 10 years ago, the world's financial tsunami was the real estate crisis in the United States.
The reason for the real estate crisis in the United States was attributed to two rooms: the beauty of the house and the beauty of the premises.
In the Golden Age in the United States, real estate companies, in order to expand sales to low-income people in the United States, the real estate market was also a happy time in the United States economy, but it was not long, and as the US economy stalled, causing a decline in the income of buyers, and a large number of household consumption spending began to decline.
However, the current situation in the United States was part of the United States household assets and real estate assets, and almost all household assets in the United States were all real estate, while most of the top 20 per cent of the high-income groups were financial assets, and the higher the debt rate of the poor real estate in the United States.
One serious fact is that these people buy houses at better economic times, so the money to pay mortgages is also calculated on their better income, and when income falls, the pressure on mortgages not only did not even decline, but even because some subprime schemes have increased, so the real estate problems of these American families have evolved into a real estate crisis.
So, because of the low income, the bank started to recover the property, and when banks recover the property from the buyers who were owed loans, they would be sold at very low prices, leading to a step down in the area's house prices, which triggered a further decline in the house price, creating a vicious cycle, and when the house price fell to a certain extent, and more buyers found that their house value was even lower than their own loan, and more people stopped paying for mortgages and created more bad debts.
So, a huge vicious circle formed:
"The economic downturn - the decline in income - some people can't afford mortgages â€” banks sell down houses at low prices â€” more people stop paying back mortgages â€” banks sell â€” prices fall..."
And the problem is more than that, because the house price continues to fall, it's not that you don't have any debt after the bank auction house, and if the bank doesn't have the money you owe the bank's loan, you still need to pay back, and simply, assuming you buy a $3 million at the first payment, 2.4 million at the loan, and when the house fell to $2 million, you stopped lending the house to the bank, and you didn't lose your own first payment, but you owe the bank's 400,000 debt, and you'd have to pay back.
So, in the next vicious circle, the US economy is falling apart and eventually triggered the United States financial crisis in 2008.
So, the level of debt rates in China at this stage, reaching 46.8 per cent, is a very need to be vigilant, which is still below developed countries, but the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly stressed the issue of leverage since last year, which is a very preliminary judgment that family debt rates, if they are released to continue to climb, they will certainly trigger huge risks, so to be protected against financial risk.
So the house was used to live, not for the location of the fire, and the country was faster to build multiple main supply, multi-channel security, rental mergers, etc., to further resolve potential risks.
For our personal families, it is important to give up real estate speculation, buy a house, and avoid a huge burden on our families, and only rational assessment of our income and debt levels are a healthy path to family wealth development.

British inventors implanted chips in their own body, and waved in the car.
A British inventor installed a chip for himself, just waved to open his front door, enter the office and even start the car, become the first person in the country.
33-year-old Steven Nosham implanted a small chip between his thumb and index finger and is now providing this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, which is done by his company BioTeq through technology.
He's joined forces with Dr. Jeff Watson, a senior consultant at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, Hamp County, to ensure that the implant process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to the cat and dog chip, and it takes 30 seconds.
Mr. Nosham's company will also replace the locks of rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, which cost 300 pounds per lock.

On 10 July, the National Statistical Office released the National Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Industrial Producers Price Index (PPI).
The White House props cost thousands.
According to the military records released by the Times magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of the American manufacturing industry, at a cost of $24,000.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D is a major exhibit at the White House on July 17th.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pens and senior White House officials visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibit was a helicopter made in Connecticut, a Maine yacht, a fire truck in Wisconsin and a forklift in Mississippi.
According to the records of the first fleet of the Marines (HMX-1) of the helicopter, the White House military office requested the helicopter to appear on daily orders (FRAGO), which is only 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the South Lawn event.
The day before the event, HMX-1 commander, in an e-mail from the upper Marines Deputy Commander, said, "I just want to confirm that this event is highly valued."
This information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17th at 3 p.m., leaving after 6 to 9 p.m. the lawn was cleared.
The information also indicates that if the time from the White House is delayed, the flight is due to the second group of crews because of the time limit on duty.
The original crew was on standby by the helicopter during the operation, while security force personnel were standing by the vicinity while the plane was on the ground.
The record of the Times magazine does not clearly indicate whether the second group of crews is eventually needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record states that HMX-1 asked if the event violated the bill.
The commander wrote, "One question we asked is whether this is against the Hatch Act and was told that it was not violated."
"Speaks like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The White House defines this American manufacturing campaign as an official event and is therefore not subject to the Hach Act.
But even official activities are political.
During the event, the President introduced the issue of the Senate at the time: medical reform and was a great deal of control over government regulations.
It's not new to use Marines One or Air Force One for political propaganda purposes.
The presidents have been asked to travel on these planes.
But it's not common for photo purposes.
In February, Trump was concerned, when the presidential plane slowly slipped in Melbourne, Florida, and eventually stopped at his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was full of complaints about the former president's use of the presidential plane.
The White House Deputy News spokesman Lindsay Walters said, "The White House was so excited about the "American Manufacturing" exhibition, which showed products from all 50 states, which were made by American workers using American materials. "
HMX-1 crews often train in flight near Washington and South Lawn to practice the exact placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
During the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings in the White House.
An official claims that the U.S. manufacturing flight was included in the training requirements of the crew this month.
The helicopter troops also flew 11 hours of "non-President support mission" that day.
The White House says taxpayers have not borne any other props in the event.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not involved in organizing the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 does not retain the budget records of the President ' s flight, and therefore it is very difficult to determine the accurate costs of the event.
However, according to the hourly cost of the Ministry of Defence for the 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defence of VH-3D may be reimbursed at $24,380 per flight hour.
The troops recorded 30 minutes of flight from the base of the Quantico Marine Airport, Virginia.
The White House says the cost of operating the helicopter is much lower than that cost.
Walters says, "It's very misleading to estimate the cost of taxpayers based on reimbursable fees.
These estimated costs include staff costs, maintenance costs and many others, including the sink costs of annual allocations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Ministry of Defence could reimbursement costs do not include personnel costs, but indeed includes oil, maintenance and contractual costs.
At that time, Sean Spike, a former White House news spokesman, defended the helicopter for the event.
And it says, "The idea is showing what America made this week,
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, and they all contributed a strength to our national security, and I guess that even if there are thousands of people to rely on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of countless Americans.
So it's not appropriate to show that this is not appropriate. "
We don't know if Trump interacts with the helicopter while visiting the South Lawn during the campaign, but he did get on the fire truck's seat.
In the White House, Trump spoke to the representative of Sikorsky, joking with the company he owns with the press.
He said, "I know the Sikorsky plane.
