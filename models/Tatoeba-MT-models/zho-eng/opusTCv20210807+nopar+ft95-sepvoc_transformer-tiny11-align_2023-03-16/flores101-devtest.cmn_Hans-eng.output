Yesterday, Martelli was sworn in in in in in the new Interim Electoral Commission (CEP), composed of nine members.
This is the fifth election of the Haitian Interim Electoral Commission in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Committee recommended that the former CEP resign as part of the move towards a new election.
The committee was a response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protests have been triggered by the failure of some elections to be held on schedule, and sometimes protests have escalated into violence.

According to the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA), the new generation of air transport systems (NextGen) can reduce aircraft flight routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, not old ground radar technology, enabling air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no additional transport, and the train on the ground is in Wembley, and there's no parking lot and parking facilities.
Fear of lack of transport, the game may be forced to close without team supporters.
Thursday, a study published in Science magazine states that a new bird formed in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, reported that this new species evolved for only two generations, despite the thought that the process would take longer.
Gold can be processed into shapes, and it can be written into tiny shapes.
It's a little silk, it's used to entanglement and tectonics, or it can be stomped or crushed.
It can be thin, sticky on other metals, and sometimes it can be used to decorate hand drawings in books called "Colour Hand Copy".
It's called the pH value of chemical matter.
The color of the cabbage juice will change according to the acid properties of the chemical substance.
pH values are expressed in the number of hydrogen (pH) ions in measured chemicals.
Hydrogen ion is the proton that lost electrons (because hydrogen atoms are made up of protons and an electronic).
Smash two dry powders to mix them and rub them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hand reacts to the outer layer, which will form something like the shell, which feels very interesting.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every household have a toilet pump, which is linked to the sophisticated sewage treatment system.
Sewage systems were found in houses in the cities of Crete and Santorini Minos, Greece.
In Roman civilization, toilets are sometimes part of a mixed public bathroom between men and women.
You call people a thousand miles away, you use the satellite.
When the satellite in space received a call, almost immediately reflected it back.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and vision.
To send satellites or telescopes into space, it takes a giant rocket above 100 feet high.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way, and the wheel's greatest contribution to us is to make our traffic easier.
With it, we have trains, cars and many other transportation.
They're down to more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits, antelope to deer.
Eventually, there are a lot of small cats (including scattered pet cats), eating a lot of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to success is the Liki concept, and every cat is responsible for a special job to prevent them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most visible cats of the group, living in large groups called lions.
The lions are made up of adult males of one or three relatives, and up to 30 females and cubs.
As a sister and daughter in the family, the female is usually close to each other.
The lions behave very similar to wolves or dogs, which are amazingly similar to lions (but unlike other large cats), and these acts are very deadly for their prey.
Tigers are all-powerful athletes, they climb, swim, jump, pull five times the human Hercules.
Tigers are the same type as lions, leopards and Jaguars.
Tiger growling is not as deep as the lion's roar, but more like a angry word.
If the conditions allow them, they capture monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, and leopard cats are almost much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that leopard cats are tracking and looking for animals to hunt through smell and sniffing prey on the ground.
They have a strong night vision, they can see in the dark, and they're very secret.
When a small group of organisms (a small species) is separated from their original main species (e.g. they cross mountains and rivers, or they reach a new island so that they can't easily return), they usually find their environment different from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so new populations will require different features or resilience to become a strong rival, not what they needed before.
The original stocks have not changed, and they still need to adapt to the environment as they used to.
Over time, new stocks began to adapt to new environments, and they are beginning to become less and less similar to other populations.
After thousands or millions of years, these two groups eventually seem to be very different so that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process "species formation", which is the formation of new species, which is the inevitable result of evolution and the most important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen inhaled humans, absorb carbon dioxide from humans.
Plants get nutrients from the sun through light cooperation, and they also provide shade.
We make houses with plants, make clothes with plants, and most of the food we eat are plants, and animals can't survive without plants.
The dragon is the top predator of that time, and it's not afraid of anything but his kind.
It's full of 70 razor-like teeth, and there's a row on its jaw, which means there's no way to escape anything that meets it.
Its tongue may be fork, and we're not sure about it.
It attacks anything into the water; even giant dinosaurs like the dragons are not their rivals.
Although most of the food of the Romans is common to us, they do have some strange or unusual feast dishes, including boars, peacocks, snails and a rodent called sleeping rats.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit in chairs and eat, and the rich like to come together and have dinner.
A few centuries later, food from America or Asia into Europe cannot be found in the ancient Romans' diet.
For example, they don't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes and cocoa, and no ancient Romans have eaten turkeys.

If you've seen the movie "The National Treasure," you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But it's not. Although there's something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words on the back of the Declaration of Independence wrote the words "Initiative Declaration of Independence 4th July 1776." The text was written at the bottom of the document, which was upside down.
Although no one can determine who the author is, this large sheep paper document (size 293-inch multiplied by 241 inches) is allegedly stored when it was written.
So, it's probably just added as a label.
Normandy landed and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the French of Wishi, who entered a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, not against the aggressors, but working with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces entered southern France, which was called Operation Dragon Cavalry.
In just two weeks, the United States and the free French army liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a group of people working together, working together.
The word "civilization" comes from Latin "civilis" and is related to Latin "civis" and "civitas" (means "city" or "city" ), which also defines the size of society in some way.
The city is the predecessor of the nation, and civilized culture means the generation of knowledge, the footprint of culture, and culture can spread fairly.
Minority culture often disappears without leaving relevant historical evidence and is not treated as a decent civilization.
During the War of Independence, 13 states initially formed a weak central government under the Federal Regulations.
Congress does not have the power to tax, and because without the State administration or the judiciary, Congress can only rely on the state government to enforce all bills, and the state government often does not cooperate.
It has no power to overthrow tax laws and customs duties between states.
These provisions must be agreed by all states to be modified, while the state treats the central government very slowly, so that its state representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second successful team in the world, winning the football World Cup in 2006.

Winter movement is the most popular in the north, where Italians will be in international and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (the largest island of the state), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the many islands in Japan, Japan is often called the island from a geological perspective.
Western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when the European sailors named the island "Ilha Formosa," meaning beautiful islands.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Corporation established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, beginning to change the way indigenous people food production is produced and hired Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Great Qing Empire announced its establishment in Taiwan.
In 1895, after the defeat of the midday war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Matan Treaty, which cut Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings: Intihuatana, the temple of the sun and the three windows.
To make tourists better aware of the landscape of the complex, most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been repaired and the repairs continued until today.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is 35mm format, which is the dominant film size at the end of the film age.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, its long width ratio is applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of 35 mm format is 36 mm wide, 24 mm high, which is a little confusing.
So the width ratio of this format (except 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format series) are the same or close to this long width ratio.
The tri-point method that is often abused and mocked, is a simple guidance method when creating dynamics, and it keeps images orderly.
It points out that the most effective position for the subject is the intersection of lines that divide images vertically and horizontal into three parts (see example).
During the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was closely monitored.
Although European languages and customs vary, Christianity has been linked to them for over a thousand years.
From the king to the civilian, it's all over the 10th side affects everyone.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate pain and poverty, and the Church's Monetary Fund was created specifically for this purpose.
The central system of the Church has existed in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money has led many people to question whether they comply with this doctrine.
Shortly after the hostilities broke out, Britain began to impose a maritime blockade on Germany.
They cut off the supply of military and civilian material at stake. It has proven to be effective, although such blockades have violated international law that has been widely accepted under several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain debreed in international waters, preventing any ship from entering the entire sea, even threatening neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this strategy, Germany expects its unlimited submarine warfare to respond similar.
In the 20th century, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacistic, separatist.
After seeing the violence of the First World War, all countries are eager to avoid doing the same.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at Edison, New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had four cents, a poem, and a recommendation to Thomas Edison.
China's ancient times have characteristics; every period or every family in China is a distinct dynasty.
Similarly, it was a time of instability between small countries, the most famous of which was 60 years of three countries, between the two generations of Han Jin.
During these riots, there was a fierce war for the throne.
The three countries are one of the most bloody times in the ancient history of China.
There are also many social and political impacts, such as the use of units, from dictatorship to Republican, nationalism, believing that the country is not the only ruler but the people.
Moreover, after the revolution, the official service is open to all men, which gives the most ambitious and successful people to fly Wong Tenda.
And so is the army, because the rank of rank is no longer based on grade, but based on talent.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in many other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was very interested in things other than life. He used to go to a cave called Sheila on the Hill of Nour.
The cave itself was preserved not only by the test of time, but also brought a very vivid image to Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave is sitting on a mountain in the north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside.
In fact, even if it exists, it's not easy to find.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky and the mountains around them.
The Giza pyramid is the only building that is still standing in seven miracles.
The Great Pyramid is the masterpiece of the Egyptians in the third century B.C., one of the many large pyramids that salute the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau of the Valley of Death in Egypt (the "Giza Pyramid") includes several pyramids (the largest of which are the largest), several small graves, several temples and lions.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate Pharaoh Hoof and built many smaller pyramids, graves and temples to commemorate Huf's wives and family members.
The "top bow" symbol is like the letter V, the "down bow" symbol is like a nail or a square on the bottom.
Up there is a bow starting at the top, and down it means pulling bows from the bow root.

The mob forced the king and queen to open the carriage window completely.
In front of the scared queen, a mob waved a royal guard's head, killed in Versailles.
The war spending of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines was paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to tax the United States colonial regime to pay most of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street Bank.
Of course, the long-term exploitation of the Philippine people's high profits is the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights of the Temple, you must understand the background that prompted the Order of the Temple.
The age of events is usually called the medieval time of European history, i.e. 11, 12 and the 13th century (1,000-1300 A.D.).
The medieval era was early in the Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, and the agreement was made that the late medieval period ended around 1,500 years.
The technical decision theory is a term that covers many ideas in practice, including technological promotion, technical necessity, and a strict definition - human fate is driven by the logic behind the laws of science and its performance in technology.
Most interpretations of technical decision-making include these two general ideas: the development of technology itself goes far beyond cultural or political impact, and technology in turn has an inherent "impact" on society without social conditions.
For example, some might say that cars will certainly promote road development.
However, the establishment of a national road network for a few cars is not economically feasible, so new production methods are born to reduce the cost of ownership of cars.
Higher vehicle security also leads to higher incidence of road traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of new medical technologies for repairing the injuries of the wounded.
Romanticism has a strong cultural decision, which is derived from writers like Gold, Fisher and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, geographical-related customs and culture emerged, which are much better than arbitrary laws that are in harmony with society.
As Paris is called the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of the European era of feudal.
Its reputation as a luxury centre began around 400 A.D. and continued until around 1100 A.D.
Its position fell in the twelfth century, mainly because of gifts from the Crusades, such as silk and spices, which are more valuable than the Byzantine market offers.
It was at this point that fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the 10-11th to the 14th century.
At first, the dress was influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because cultural communication is slow, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
With the end of the Middle Ages, the Western European people gradually developed their style, one of the greatest advances at the time was the Crusades, and people started to use buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is used to produce agricultural activities that only meet the food needed by farmers and their families.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple and usually organic system that uses local seeds stored in the ecological zone, combined with crop rotations or other relatively simple technologies, thereby maximizing production.
Historically, most farmers are engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production.
Asian culture unites the same-minded individuals who feel neglected by social standards, and subculturals have developed a sense of identity between them.
Given the age, race, class, location and/or gender differences of members, subculturals may be characterized.
Making Asian culture a different character, possibly a combination of languages, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography or a variety of factors.
Members of subcultural groups often use unique style of acting to demonstrate their membership, including fashion costumes, behavior and black words.
To illustrate the importance of socialization, one of the most common methods is to use cases of a few unfortunate children who have not become socialized with the help of adults due to neglect, suffering from unfortunate or intentional abuse.
Some wild children are banned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the child is abandoned because parents refuse to accept the child with intellectual or physical serious defects.
Wild children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or left.
Others are said to be raised by animals; some live alone.
If the wolves grow up entirely by non-human animals, their behavior (as permitted by physical conditions) will be very cool with the animal, for example, to show fear or indifference to humans.
Although project learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the stub learning method goes further.
Stifler teaching is not a learning method, but a means of supporting people who have just learned to use new computer programs or start new projects.
The stairwell teaching can be conducted online or offline, in other words, a form of a stairwell teaching, just like the retrospect assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support internalization is used to question, hint and explain programs that may be difficult to handle for students alone.
Children are foster care for various reasons, neglected, abused, even blackmailed.
No child should grow in an environment without upbringing, no love, no education, but it's against wish.
We think the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
The foster care system should provide all essentials that their original families lack.
The Internet combines the elements of mass communication and interpersonal transmission.
The distinct features of the Internet add additional dimensions to their use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "interchange" are considered an important motive for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In studying the audience's response to the website, Emile and McD (1998) also used "personal participation" and "continuing relationships" as a new motivation.
The use of the video has brought significant discoveries to the interpretation of micro-expression (a few milliseconds of facial movement).
Specifically, it is said that a person can judge whether a person is lying by correct interpretation.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, "President's speech", pointed out that those who could not understand language because of brain damage still can accurately judge whether the speakers are sincere.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior could be the skills of animals like dogs.
The twentieth century shows that genetic variations have two libraries: visibility and hidden.
The mutation adds new genetic variations, while the choice removes the mutation from the expressed genetic mutation pool.
The mutation changes between the two libraries of each generation due to separation and reorganization.
In tropical grasslands, primates have a digestive system similar to humans, and existing plant resources are difficult to meet the needs of primates for amino acid.
Moreover, if this is not possible, it will have serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, eventually leading to death.
The most accessible plant resources should be proteins in leaves and beans, but primates like us are difficult to digest the protein unless it's cooked.
By contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only digestive, but also provides a large amount of protein, containing all necessary amino acids.
In conclusion, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solve the protein problem differently from the way we use chimps on the tropical grasslands today.
Sleep interruption means a process like this: wake up deliberately during normal sleep and sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
It's easy to do it, using relatively quiet alarm clocks to wake you up without being completely awakened.
If you find yourself to reset the alarm clock while you're sleeping, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room and force yourself to close the alarm clock.
Other biological rhythm-based options include large quantities of drinking liquids before bedtime (especially water or tea — well known to pee) and force themselves to pee.
The degree of calmness in a person is the opposite of physical and mental stress.
The less pressure, the more active the life force, the more you can find absolute calm and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the open horizon, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been expanded through many techniques of the universal love of Buddhism and Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple.
In Quintarini yoga, Quintarini energy was awakened through yoga positions, breathing exercises, reading and visual images.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Sky Yoga, and by making different gods image, purification energy channels, activate the cave, thereby reaching the level of awareness.
Germany is the common enemy of the countries of World War II, which promotes cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
The war lasted 40 years, and the proxy army fought in many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish line had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and adapt the army along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight, entering over 800,000 Soviet Red Armys and formed positions in Belarus and Ukraine after violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet Union ' s non-violability treaty and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, the invasion of the eastern part of Poland.
To date, shipping is the most effective way to transport a large number of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the Navy's mandate is to ensure that the State maintains the capacity of transport personnel and goods, while disrupting the enemy ' s ability to transport their personnel and goods.
One of the most noteworthy modern examples is the North Atlantic Battle during World War II. Americans tried to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy, based on U submarines, tried to intercept the transport.
If the allies fail, Germany could have conquered Britain as the rest of Europe.
The goats seem to have been tamed for the first time in the Zagros mountains in Iran around 10,000 years ago.
The ancient civilization and tribes began to tame them, eat and use their milk, meat, fur and skin.
The goats are usually planted in mountains or other pastoral areas, usually subject to goats (mostly children or adolescents), similar to the more well-known shepherds. These shepherds are still in use.
Britain built the van lane in the 16th century.
Although the Mara orbital car was only made of parallel boards, at that time, in the case of a slightly difficult road, these cars could run faster and pulled more.
Soon, a pillow was introduced for fixed tracks, but people realized that if you put on the tracks, the tracks would be more stable and effective.
It's a common practice, but iron chips make wood-made carriage wheels worse.
Eventually, the wheel was replaced by the iron wheel. In 1767, the first whole iron orbit was born.
The first known way of transportation is to walk. 2 million years ago, with the emergence of the straight-up, humans began to walk straight.
Their ancestors have no habit of walking straight.
People found a double-footing phenomenon in Southern ape fossils 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago, although the Saheranthropus may have walked with legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, join environmental campaigns, even environmental activists, to some extent reduce future disasters.
But if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root causes of the problem and completely eradicate it.
It is clear that the world has changed considerably as a result of human scientific and technological advances, while overpopulation and human luxury lifestyles have made the problem more serious.
The draft handwritten by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary-General Charles Thomson was approved by the Continental Parliament on 4 July and was then sent to John Dunrap Printing Plant, several blocks away.
150 to 200 copies were printed overnight, and now known as Dunlap broadsides.
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly in the yard of the Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and Washington read this letter to his army in New York on July 9, a copy of which arrived in London on August 10th.
The remaining 25 copies of the Dunlap single-sided print are the first version of the file that is now available. The handwritten originals were not kept.
Many ancient biologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and has survived, which we call "birds".
Many people think they're not dinosaurs because they have feathers, they fly.
But birds still have a lot of places like dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs and walk like a dragon with two back legs.
Today, almost all the computers that are in use are based on information on binary code processing.
The binary number can only account for one of the two values, namely 0 or 1, which is called binary numbers, i.e. "bit" in computer terms.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible, vomiting, and symptoms such as vomiting are widespread and therefore cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The most powerful indicator for ingestion of poison may be the container that was opened on the scene with drugs or domestic toxic chemicals.
Check the labels on the poison and get specific first aid guidelines.
Insectists use the word "bug" to call this kind of insects.
The term is derived from people's familiarity with bugs, and bugs are very adapted to humans.
The gills and bugs are nesting insects, adapted to living in the host's nest or housing.
In all parts of the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which has become the main nervous system disease for young and medium-sized people.
Multi-haired hardening is a disease affecting the central nervous system (composed of brain, spinal cord and vision).
The study found that women have multiple sclerosis (MS) twice as likely as men.
A couple may decide not to give birth for their own interests or for their children.
These couples may make adoption plans for their children.
During adoption, biological parents terminated their rights as parents so that another couple could raise their children.
The main purpose of science is to identify the way the world works through scientific methods.
Experiments are an experiment to eliminate one or more possibilities, but experiments are not the only way to ask questions and observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declines, the West is out of its Greek philosophy and scientific roots.
Many physiological rhythms and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers often depend largely on the inner life cycle generated through biological clocks and their existence.
The cyclical rhythm is not just a simple reaction to external cycle signals, which are recorded in most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustainable swing devices, and even without external tips, will last a period of free operation.
Hershey and Chase experiment is one of the main signs of genetic matter.
Hershi and Chase use the fungus or virus to plant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, one of which marked the fungus with radioactive phosphorus, the protein that marked the fungus with radioactive sulphur.
mutation has a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of affected genetic substances and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only mutation of reproductive cells can be inherited to children, while mutation of other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts tourists interested in natural areas who come to see natural landscapes, including wildlife.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and research ecosystems.
For example, visiting Borneo, filming and understanding of chimpanzees.

In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is connected in some way to and support the transport system based on private cars.
Today, science shows that this large carbon economy will no longer keep the biosphere that supports human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone is part of society, using traffic systems, and almost everyone has complaints about the traffic system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the extent of water quality or bridge collapse.
Why would the traffic system cause such complaints? Why do they fail every day? Is there a traffic engineer incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic studies are the movement between drivers and vehicles at two points, and their interaction.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study the traffic because the driver's behavior cannot be 100% determined.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour is often within a reasonable consistency; therefore, traffic flows often have a certain reasonable consistency that can be expressed in a rough mathematical manner.
To better express traffic, relationships were established between the following three main features: (1) traffic, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the first animals to fly in the air, flying capabilities make it easier to avoid the enemy and find food and spouses more effectively.

People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, copper, because they can be found in nature in natural form and are easier to exploit using original tools.
The philosopher Aristotle has suggested a theory that everything is made up of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air and fire.
It's more like four states of the substance (in order of break-up): solids, liquids, gases and plasmas, but he also put forward theory that they will turn into new substances, which form what we see.
The alloys are basically mixed with two or more metals, and don't forget, there are many elements on the periodic table of elements.
Calcium, potassium, etc. are metal, silver and gold, of course, metal.
There are also alloys containing a small amount of non-metal elements (e.g. carbon).

The work of the fissile atomic bomb is as follows: bringing together an atomic core with many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy little cart up the mountain, split the atomic core again, and release some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable atomic cores, which means they are likely to divide without little or without irritation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km thick, about 100 km thick.
The crust below the dark side is thin, the crust is thicker under the highlands.
Because the crust is thinner, the nearest side may have more dark, lava can rise to the surface.
The core of the theory of incentive content is to find recognized or interesting factors.
These theories show that when people mature to some adult age, certain needs and/or desires are internalized.
These theory studies why some people want to do what they do and what they live in the environment they do or do something.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's demand level theory and the two-factor theory of Hetzberg.
Generally, when managers start leading past colleagues, there are two kinds of behavior.
It is difficult for managers of this type to make inhuman decisions, difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, performance assessment, allocation of responsibilities and accountability.
In another extreme case, this man will become an individual that is very different from before, and thinks he/she has to change what the team does and take the results.
After all, leaders have a final responsibility for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to differences between leadership and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to stick to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are minor differences.
Virtual team members often serve as contact points for the corresponding offline team.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, because their team may arrange meeting time for different time zones, and local management may not understand that.
The existence of the real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
"The invisible team" means the management team that every member reports to it.
Why does an organization spend so long building learning organizations? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used between the functional departments of an organization, creativity and creativity occur.
Therefore, in working together to overcome obstacles, often brings new innovative processes to meet the needs of clients.
Before the organization can innovate, leadership must create an innovative culture, share knowledge and organize learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity program as a way to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiology data provide physical evidence for cognitive research. It therefore narrows the scope of the study and makes research more precise.
The relevance of brain pathology and behavior can support scientists' research.
We knew that different types of brain damage, trauma, disease and tumors had an impact on human behaviour and caused some mental functions to change.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and work of the brain, which are never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials that help us understand the process of functioning the brain.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction color, but it's actually a very important branch of computer science, researching machine behavior, learning and smart adaptation.
AI research involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and movement, ability to respond to client diagnosis and client problems, and handwritten recognition, sound and face functions.
All of this has become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, and some domestic computer and video game software applications already have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field trips are an important part of any teaching activity. Usually, teachers are happy to take students to places where the buses can't reach.

Blogs can also help students to improve their writing skills. Although students start writing blogs, grammar and spelling are often very grumpy, and the emergence of readers usually changes this situation.
Students are often the most picky readers, so bloggers are trying to improve writing and avoid being criticized.
Besides, writing blogs are "to force students to be more insight around the world." To satisfy the audience's interest, students are inspired, becoming smart and interesting.
Bloging is a tool that can stimulate cooperation and encourage students to extend learning beyond traditional school classes.
"The proper use of blogs" can make students more analytical and think better; by actively responding to web materials, students can find their position in the context of their articles and to raise their views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002). "
