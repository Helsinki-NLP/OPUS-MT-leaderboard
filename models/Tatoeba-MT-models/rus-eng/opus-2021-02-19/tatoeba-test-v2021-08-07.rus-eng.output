White: rooks per a1, pawn per b6, king per c8, black: pawns per a7 and b7, king per a8, elephant per b8, whites put the opponent in the Zwgzwang position, placing the rook on a6, leaving blacks with only two options: take the rook on a6 or move the elephant to any other diagonal field b8-h2. In the first case, whites move the pawn from b6 to b7 and put the mat; in the second case, the white rook takes the black pawn on a7 with the same result.
