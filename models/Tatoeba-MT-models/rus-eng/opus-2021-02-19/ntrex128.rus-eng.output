Members of the Welsh Assembly do not want to “like mappets”
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is dissatisfaction with the proposal to accept the acronym MWP for their name (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
A problematic solution is the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes to this acronym.
One Labourer, expressing his party’s opinion, expressed concern that the new acronym “renames Twp and Pwp.”
For our readers, it's not from Wales: in Welsh twp means "stupid," and pwp means "cushka".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Wales Party, his organization was generally “dissatisfied” and offered other options.
Conservative party representatives do not object to the new acronym, but note that MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a change of name law, made the following statement: “The final decision on the names of the members of the Assembly will, of course, remain with them”.
The Wales Administration Act 2017 has the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the “Parliament of Wales” option, instead of “Assembly”, was widely accepted by the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the option “Welsh Parliament Members” (WMP), while the MWP option received the greatest public support.
Members of the Assembly seem to be offering other options, but it will not be easy for the presiding member, Elin Jones, to find a satisfactory solution; let us remind you that the draft change bill should be submitted in a few weeks.
Reform laws would include other modifications to the Assembly ' s work process, including new rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the establishment of the Committee system.
Members of the Assembly will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change their country's name.
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote to change the name of the country to “The Republic of Northern Macedonia”.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims against the Greek province, and has repeatedly opposed the accession of its northern neighbour to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, opposed to the change of name referendum, stated that he was not going to accept its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the name of the country is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The Garlem Parish Crisis: St. Martin's bells have been silenced forever.
“The old neighborhoods I spoke to said that there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams says.
“Now there is none left.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
“The form of communication has changed.”
“The bar has ceased to be a sort of living room of the entire area to which regular visits have been made.”
But as for the churches, it is a matter of concern that the funds obtained from the sale of assets will not last long, no matter how much their leaders hope. “They will be left with nothing sooner or later.”
At the site of the church, he added, there would be a multifamily house whose occupants were unlikely to support the parishes that had been left in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams says. “This will bring closer the day when such churches will finally close, because the new neighbors will never become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black area: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church 10 years later.
The first parishioners of the Methodist Church left the parish in the 1930s.
Their building was bought by a black parish next door.
When St. Martin's Church fell into the hands of the black community, it was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted shops on 125th Street, Harlem's main commercial artery, where they refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire caused significant damage to the building, and during the reconstruction work Father Johnson's parishioners ordered a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who succeeded him at the head of St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the carillon “bells for the poor.”
But the expert who tried the carillon in July called it “cultural heritage” and “unique historical instrument.”
An expert from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that it was the carillon from St. Martin ' s Church that was the world ' s first instrument of its kind played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. Eighteen years ago, he was invited to play a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's church still hasn't found a replacement for him.
Over the past few months, there has been a difficult situation around St. Martin's Church with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by church secular leaders and others by the Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, addressed the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to transfer the cost of the work” to the congregation, although the latter had no bearing on the selection of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the diocese ' s lack of transparency.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old lobster diver
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of lobster season, a 13-year-old diver in California was attacked by a shark and injured.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach beach in Ensignas.
As Chad Hummel told us in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), he dived with friends on Saturday morning, and about half an hour later heard the boy screaming for help, and along with his friends, they swam by boat to the scene of the attack and pulled the young man out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was excited to catch the lobster, but quickly “found that he was shouting ‘ I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
As he approached the diver, Hummel noticed that “he had completely torn the skin around his clavicle.”
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, ‘Here is a shark!’” Hummel says.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Redi Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The species of shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, reported in a press briefing that a shark had been seen at the site a few weeks ago, but had not been identified as a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack sustained injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours in order to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles observed that there are 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury's planning to take over Britain's perfume market.
Seinsbury is going to install cosmetics and perfume departments in Booths, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetology consultants, based on the luxury department store model.
The perfume and cosmetics market in Britain is estimated at Pound2.8 billion and continues to expand, while the fashion and goods market for the home are falling; to capture a significant portion of this desirable market, vast cosmetics and perfumes will be presented as an experiment in 11 shops across the country, and if successful next year, they should be expected in many other shops.
Supermarket owners are looking for something to fill the shelves previously placed under television, microwave ovens, goods for home, and investments in the perfume and cosmetics market seem to be a good solution.
According to the Seinsbury representatives, it is planned to double the range of cosmetics to 3,000 items, including, for the first time, stamps such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in designated locations, by the type of product organization in Booths stores.
In addition, the patented “cosmetic” product line for vegan products will be reorganized to meet the needs of young buyers.
Two of the stores in Seinsbury will present perfume shops in Fragrance Shop: the first has already opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second is expected to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet commerce and the tendency to buy small quantities of products for each day in small shops near home have forced supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President Seinsbury, says that the outlet will gradually become a department store, and his supermarket chain is fighting for buyers to compete against cheap shops like Aldy and Lidle, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of supermarkets in Seinsbury house Argos, and some of them now have Habitats stores since the network acquired both stamps two years ago, resulting in increased food sales and revenues from these acquisitions.
The supermarket’s previous attempts to give new life to its cosmetics and medicine departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Seinsbury and Booths was established, but further disagreements arose between the participants over the distribution of revenues from the sale of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Seinsbury pharmaceutical business (a total of 281 stores) to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Farmasi's network, for £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide line of luxury skin care to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Seinsbury: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favourable environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be available to assist the board.
Our variety of stamps for any taste, pleasant design and convenience of shops will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfume, and it will be a completely new concept of shopping."
Peter Jones "wrongly" reacted to Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the £11 million deal.
The star of the Dragon Lion show, Peter Jones, is "enraged" by the release of TV host Holly Willoughby from the £11 million deal she was planning to make with Peter's lifestyle brand, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their joint makeovers and Truly accessories.
This couple's business was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of this morning's programme announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby’s decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV enraged Peter Jones, the star of Dragon Lion.
According to our sources, Jones was “enraged” when, at a busy meeting held at his business empire’s headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, she admitted that, with new contracts worth up to 1.5 million, she would not have enough time for their common brand of Truly’s household clothing and accessories.
Their brand was compared to the child of actress Gwyneth Paltrow with the Goop brand, and its sales were expected to double Willoughby's worth of £11 million.
The 37-year-old host announced her departure from Instagram, while Jones left the UK on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly was Holly's top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would provide her with a carefree existence for the next few decades.
Her decision has caused the collapse of all parties involved in the transaction.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, because the stamp was only a few weeks away.
There remained a warehouse at Marlowe headquarters filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host of this morning, one of Britain’s most popular stars, could cost the firm a million pounds sterling because of the substantial investment in goods, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay in launching the line.
It is also a matter of breaking long-standing friendships.
The raising of Willoughby's three children and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby created a Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, took over the company in March.
Both couples often spend vacations together, and Jones also owns 40% of Dan Baldwin's share of the company's TV production.
Willoughby will be the M&S ambassador and will replace Anthony McPartlin in the role of ITV's host, "I am a celebrity".
A source from Jones’s inner circle said last night, “We can't comment on his commercial affairs.”
Difficult negotiations, “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism that the media would bring to him because of the “unworthy president”’s comments and the positive assessment of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Said Trump, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
“I have not given up anything.”
He noted that Kim Jong-un was interested in a re-meeting after Trump called them the first summit, held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing North Korean nuclear weapons stockpiles.
But the negotiations on denuclearization are at an impasse.
Three months after the June Singapore summit, high-ranking North Korean diplomat Lee Young-ho addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly meeting on Saturday, saying that North Korea is still waiting for an “adequate response” from the US after the DPRK’s initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the US, noted the diplomat, continues to use sanctions as leverage.
President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment during a meeting of his supporters.
“North Korea is doing great,” he said.
“We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have a wonderful relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un had borne fruit: the missile tests had been brought to an end, the hostages had been released and the remaining United States troops had also returned to their homeland.
Speaking of his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was nothing strange.
“The President’s message is so simple, but then instead of the 10,000 people on the street who rush into this completely crowded room, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd that was gathered in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction recorded, hundreds of casualties
In the early days following the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs said that there was no need for their assistance.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had lost its roof, the Government had not deemed it necessary to declare a national disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that international support is not needed, so it has not been easy,” Selina Sambung says.
Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Pala, but we do not yet know if the foreign team will be able to work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Disaster Management Office, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
Given the persistent seismic instability in Indonesia, the country is still horribly ill prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other shorelines.
Despite the warning of the tsunami threat, no alarm siren was included in the Pala, which is likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
Transport between numerous Indonesian islands is problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital, previously moored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake, is headed to Palu, but the road to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the consolidation of Indonesia’s dilapidated infrastructure the main focus of his campaign and has spent countless sums on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for a new term next year, is mired in funding problems.
The President is also criticized for exacerbating sectarian strife between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands more lost their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows and arrows, and other suicides.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score against Chelsea to the far upper corner of the gate.
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeat at the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea, held on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge got a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27 meters from the Chelsea Gate when his team lost 1-0.
He shifted to the left and ran into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and ended up in the deep upper coal of the grid.
Golquiper Kepa Arrisabalag jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com website, Starridge said, "It was all about getting in that position and getting the ball, players like Shaq always play as hard as they could, so I just wanted to give myself as much time as I could."
"I saw Kante heading towards me, took the ball, and briefly ran through the gate."
At the end of the first half of the match, Chelsea had a score of 1-0 and a 25-minute goal was scored by Belgian Eden Azar.
The central attacker Chelsea, passing the pass back to Mateo Kovačić, broke half of the Liverpool through the middle of the field.
In the middle of the field, Kovačić played a single touch game.
Then he handed over the pass to Azar, who went out to the gate.
Azar surpassed the defense and struck the left flank, bypassing the goalkeeper of the Liverpool, Alison Becker, striking the far corner of the grid.
Liverpool will meet with the Napoli team during the group stage of the League of Champions, which will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA Euroleague match, which will take place on Thursday in London, also at 15:00.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the ensuing tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, as reported by the National Disaster Management Office on Sunday morning.
Many people are reported to remain under the rubble of buildings destroyed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale; the earthquake occurred on Friday and caused a tsunami with waves of up to 6 metres high, as reported by Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Office during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000 people, was littered with wreckage.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman.
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead County, Mercside County, and a murder investigation is under way.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 at the Grayson Muth complex on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to a murder among the locals.
According to Detective Inspector O'Hagen, “The investigation is at an early stage, but I strongly ask everyone who was in the John Street area of Birkenhead and could see or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to all, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something on the video recorder, and please contact us with any information that might help the investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the victim had lived in Birkenhead and that her body had been found inside the compound.
This afternoon, alleged acquaintances of the victims arrived at the scene to ask their questions about where it was discovered this morning.
An investigation was under way and the police were preparing to report the tragedy to the victim ' s next of kin.
A taxi driver at Grayson Mewes tried to enter his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he learned of what had happened, he lost the gift of speech.
Residents were told that they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One police officer told the tenant that the entire surrounding area was considered a crime scene.
One woman cried.
“How terrible,” she said.
At 2 p.m., two police buses arrived and another remained outside the fenced area.
A few policemen were put inside the fence to watch the apartment complex.
All those in possession of any information are requested to send a personal message to @MerPolCC on Twitter, to call 101 or to contact Crimestopers anonymously at 0800 555 111 (case 247, 30 September).
Cromwell's memorial in front of the House of Parliament sparked a heated debate about “rewriting history”
The “exile” of Cromwell would be a well-deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts in England by his followers, the Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Creek's proposal “crazy” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, stated: “In the context of the ongoing debate about the demolition of historical monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace has inevitably arisen.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconological movement during the British civil wars.
Oliver Cromwell is likely suffering for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived forever before.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornikcroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historic achievements of a man whom many still regard as worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell a protector of Parliament from external pressure, in his case a monarchy.
Whether this view is historically accurate remains a subject of debate among specialists.
But it can be said with certainty that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve praise and respect.”
A Chinese farmer was chewed to death by a killer pig.
In a market in southwestern China, a farmer was victimized by a pig, reported by local media.
The victim's bloody body (only his family name, "Yuan") was found with a torn artery near the market in the Lupanshui district of Guizhou Province in southern China, as reported by the Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig husband is preparing to inoculate pigs on the pig farm on May 30, 2005, in the Sinin district of Qinghai Province of China.
Yuan and his cousin came from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, his cousin discovered Yuan’s dead body, and the door to the nearby pigsty was opened.
There was a giant cartilage in the pigsty with blood on it.
A forensic medical examination found that a pig weighing 250 kg had eaten a farmer to death.
“My brother’s feet were bloodied and mutilated,” explained the newspaper Guyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the victim.
The surveillance video showed Yuan arrived at the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been isolated in a separate pen during the investigation to avoid repeated attacks.
The Yuan family is reportedly negotiating with the market authorities for compensation for the death of the farmer.
Porcine attacks on people are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal nailed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and let her go, only afraid of her wife.
In 2012, a farmer from Oregon in the United States was reportedly eaten by his own pigs, and as one Canadian farmer told CBC News, pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can affect their latent aggression as a trigger.
"The pigs are playing,
They're biting and very curious, but they have no intention of hurting you.
You should simply instil in your animals a sense of measure and respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rain to a large part of the southwest US.
According to the forecast, hurricane Rosa is losing its power by moving through a more cool water zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring heavy rains and floods into northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York City, the cyclone reached category 1 with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to emerge over the Pacific Ocean, which will move eastward to the west coast of the United States, and as the storm approaches the coast of Baja California, it will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, more than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico.
Under the influence of tropical humidity in the emerging low-pressure zone, heavy rains are expected in the south-west in the coming days.
Landfalls ranging from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous flash floods, mudfalls, and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, high tropical air humidity can cause rainfall to reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In parts of the southwest of the United States, mostly in most of Arizona, up to 5–10 cm rainfall is expected.
The risk of sudden rapidly developing floods is not ruled out because of the uneven distribution of tropical rains.
At the risk of tropical rain, walking in the desert can have serious consequences.
Livni can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunder can cause the wind to burst and raise dust clouds.
With low-pressure areas on the coast of southern California, heavy rains will fall.
It is possible to fall up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small mudflows and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, there will be tropical rains in Arizona that will spread to other areas by Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the rains will be in the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday night.
In October, there will be sharp temperature fluctuations throughout the United States due to low air temperatures in the Arctic at reasonably high tropical temperatures.
Sometimes this combination leads to severe temperature fluctuations in a small area.
Such sharp changes in temperature will be particularly evident in central U.S.A. on Sunday.
The temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees apart.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
In most of the central and eastern U.S. territories, warm weather is expected in early October, with temperatures ranging from the South Plains to the Northeast.
In New York City, the air temperature could rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast is likely to have an unusually high temperature on the eastern coast of the United States until mid-October.
The Senate hearing in the case of Judge Brett Cavanaugh saw more than 20 million viewers
The testimony of Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blazy Ford, who accuses Cavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, captured over 20 million viewers of six television channels on Thursday.
The political stand-off over Cavanaugh's candidacy was followed by an unexpected follow-up, and on Friday, there was an urgent media announcement that Republican Jeff Flake had made it a condition that charges against a lawyer be investigated by the FBI within one week.
According to Ford at the Senate Law Committee hearing, she is 100% sure that Cavanaugh was in a state of intoxication and tried to undress her at a school party.
Cavanaugh gave emotional testimony, stating that he was 100 per cent sure that it had not happened.
According to Nielsen, the Friday debate was watched by more than 20.4 million spectators.
The Agency took into account average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data on the audience of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen's rating does not always include viewers watching TV at work.
In comparison, this is the average audience watching the American football match at the playoffs or the Oscar service ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose leading supporters strongly supported Cavanaugh’s appointment: the Senate hearing, which lasted all day, was watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers, reported by Nielsen.
In second place, ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS's audience was 3.1 million, NBC's 2.94 million, MSNBC's 2.89 million viewers, and CNN's 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
After the hearings, the interest in the case has not diminished.
There was a real Jeff Flake drama on Friday.
After the senator from Arizona, who is considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Cavanaugh's candidacy, CNN and CBS were filmed as Flake encountered a group of activists in the elevator on Friday morning on his way to a meeting of the Legal Committee.
The whole world saw him drop his eyes and get beat up by angry women live on CNN.
“I stand before you,” one of them said.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“The power behind you, while so many women are powerless,” tried to explain the woman’s position.
Flake told the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on the subject at the committee meeting, and the elevator doors closed, hiding the senator from all the cameras.
A few hours later, when the Legal Committee was about to confirm Cavanaugh's candidacy for the post of judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all television channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Flake set one condition: that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate by next week, as the democratic minority sought.
Flake claims to have changed his mind because of the intervention of a friend, a senator from the Democrats, Chris Coons.
He made a final decision, talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Flake's decision had an effect because it was clear that the Republicans lacked the votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
By order of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses his critics of "political games" around the Brexit situation.
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians critical of her plan to leave the EU of putting partisan interests ahead of the public interest.
The British Prime Minister arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published on a page in May's interview, the former head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called "Shash" plan in Brexit, claiming that he considered the introduction of customs duties between Britain and the EU “absolutely ridiculous.”
Death of Wade Sims in a gunfight: Police arrested Dyon Simpson on suspicion of murdering a forward at the University of Louisiana.
The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the University of Louisiana.
According to Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Dyon Simpson was arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder.
The police released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, CBS's regional channel, the police found Simpson's DNA on the glasses found at the crime scene.
During his interrogation, Simpson admitted to having fatally injured Wade.
According to Advocate, a bond of $350,000 has been set for Simpson.
The Coroner of the Eastern District of Baton Rouge issued a preliminary detention on Friday: death was caused by a cross-sectional gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Unit, the State Criminal Investigation Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local residents who assisted in the search operations leading to the detention.
Joe Allewa, Director of Sports, University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “good faith work in catching a criminal.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
His father Wayne also played on the team at the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying that Wade Sims' tragic death had caused a shock and “real grief” for all players.
“That's what I've always been afraid of,” Coach added.
The Vulcan covered itself with the ashes of Mexico City.
The Vulcan of Popocatepetl fell into the ashes of the southern suburbs of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre of Mexico advised the population not to approach the volcano: its crater had been active and 183 steam-gas discharges had been carried out 24 hours a day.
According to the Center’s observations, the volcano was often throbbed and shivered.
In some parts of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco, social media users published photographs of the windshields of cars covered with a thin layer of ash.
After an earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which rocked the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded an increased volcanic activity 72 km south-east of the capital.
Vulcan Popocatepetl (or, for its own, Don Goyo) has been a volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists in the run-up to the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a multi-thousand rally was held in Barcelona to commemorate the first anniversary of the referendum on the secession of Catalonia from Spain, which divided the country into two camps, with clashes between autonomy advocates and the police; six rioters were detained.
The police pushed the pro-independence protesters away, while the latter, wearing black masks, threw eggs and powder paint at the guards, raising clouds of dark dust in the heart of Barcelona.
Following the use of batons by the police to contain the crowd, the unrest resumed with renewed force.
For hours, supporters of independence chanted, "Let's not forget, let's not forgive!" and their opponents responded with the slogan, "Long live Spain!"
According to local press reports, 14 participants were slightly injured in the hospital.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was declared illegal by the Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for the separatists. One year later, tensions persisted in the region seeking sovereignty.
Catalonia voted by a huge margin to withdraw from Spain, but the appearance was low because the opposition to the withdrawal had largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to block the referendum in the country ' s polling stations.
On Friday, the separatists spent the night on the declared route of a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration still took place, but it took a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcís Termes, who attended a separatist rally at his wife's company, laments that the hope of acquiring Catalonia sovereignty is becoming ever more tenuous.
“Last year, one of the most important events in our lives took place.
My parents were happy to be able to vote in a referendum, and today we are in a suspended state,” he says.
In the recent December local elections, the Catalan pro-separate parties had won an important victory, albeit with a small margin, but their movement was losing supporters this year, as many of the prominent leaders of the movement were either on the run or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoane Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a police support rally, said the conflict was being heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The tension will rise,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Zhunkeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists held in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for election to the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the regular elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government”, he says.
Londonderry: The car crashed into the house, all three co-conspirators arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry was run over by a car several times and men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested.
The attack took place on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time in the Ballinagard Cresent area.
As a result, the ram damaged the gate and the building itself, as reported by criminal investigation inspector Bob Blammings.
There are reports that an onion shot might have been fired into the car.
Livingstone's victory over Rangers thanks to Menga's mark-up goal.
Dolly Menga's first goal brought a guaranteed victory to the Livingston team.
Livingstone won an unexpected victory over the Rangers, and for the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerrard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
The exact strike of Dolly Menga equalled Gary Holt's team with the Hibernian Club in the scoreboard, where they ranked second.
The Gerrard Club won no victory this season of the Premier League, and they're meeting with the leaders of the group, the Hartes, who are eight points behind the Rangers.
The Rangers will host a League of Europe match with the Austrian club Rapid (Vienna) on Thursday.
The Livingstone Club continues its win-win series in the division, winning six games and not receiving any defeats since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's chief coach.
Lost moments for Livingstone in a fight with pushy guests.
Holt's wards were supposed to keep score from the start, and the Rangers clearly couldn't handle their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the defense line, but the goal of his weak attempt failed, and then counsel Alan Litgow, too wide, failed to stop Keig Hulkett's ball from reaching the grid.
The host side allowed Rangers to play ahead of their defense line, counting on dangerous moments to resume the game.
That's how they missed that big goal.
The Rangers gave way to a free blow, and Livingstone took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made the Menga transfer, which scored from a central position.
By then, the Rangers were superior to the ball, but the host team's protection was impenetrable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second time continued the same pattern, though Kelly still had to repel the blow from Alfredo Morelos.
Ragers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked the ball off Scott Pittman, and Litgow made a big pitch from standard position.
Balls were constantly caught in the Livingstone penalty, but all attacks were countered, and two penal requirements — one for provoking a backup player, Glenn Middleton Hulkett, and the other for playing with his hand — were not met.
"Fenomenal" Livingstone game -- analysis
BBC Scotland - Alasder Lamont, report from Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
It's a phenomenal game and a great result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again surpassed all expectations, continuing their climb to the Olympus football.
Their style and composition have hardly changed since they ascended to the top of the ratings, and Coach Holt's great credit is that he mobilized this team from the start.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Hulkett ran a perfectly organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warall from relaxing.
However, the Rangers were unable to enter the rhythm.
Although they had good moments with Coach Gerrard, this time they fell short of our expectations.
In the final minutes of the match, they lacked ownership of the ball, and only once did they get through the protection of the host team. The Rangers, which dropped to the middle of the table, had much to think about.
Erdoğan's cool reception during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, the weather was beautiful, and both the top faces were in a great mood.
This was the last day of President Erdoğan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO member countries, a visit that already involved some conflicts.
The heads of countries were unable to reach understanding on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey ' s accession to the EU.
After that, Erdoğan went to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a 25,000-strong crowd from entering the mosque, but many Erdoğan supporters were stationed nearby to see their president.
In the same place, opponents of the Erdoğan regime, including Kurds, gathered to condemn fully both Erdoğan’s policies and the German Government’s decision to invite him to visit Germany.
The existence of radically opposed views at the meeting reflects the ambiguous nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots elevate Erdoğan, while others view him as a tyrant.
Deptford Road Accident: Car crash resulted in the death of a cyclist
In London, the car ran into a cyclist who died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy crossroads in the south-eastern part of the city of Depfort, around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car and the paramedics who arrived tried to help the cyclist, but the man died unconscious.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: only a mile and a half away from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver had escaped.
The London Police Force reports that efforts are under way to identify the deceased and notify his immediate family.
In the meantime, roads have been blocked at the scene and buses have been rerouted: motorists have been asked not to enter the area.
Disarray at Long-Lartin Prison: 6 police officers injured
According to the Long-Lartin Administration, six policemen were injured during riots in the male maximum security prison.
The Long-Lartin (Wustershire) maximum-security men's prison has been in turmoil since Sunday, causing around 09:30 a.m. local time.
The Tornado task force was called in to deal with the disturbances involving eight prisoners from the same wing.
The police sustained minor injuries to the body ' s soft tissue and were treated locally.
According to the prison official, “specially trained officers were recruited to resolve the incident at the Long-Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their preventive measure may be changed for a longer period.”
Long Lartin currently holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been hospitalized by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the prison authorities were forced to call in special units to calm the burgeoning prisoners who threw pool balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which would benefit the drylands)
Arizona rarely enters an intense tropical cyclone, but this time “lucky”: at the beginning of next week, hurricane Rosa, having made the last leap, must pass over the desert part of the Southwest and bring with it the risk of flash floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of flash floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and will rain on Monday night.
The Phoenix Bureau of the National Meteorological Service reported on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression within a radius of 320 km of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 65 kilometres from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts, the National Meteorological Service will reach between 5 and 10 centimetres of precipitation, reaching 15 centimetres in the Arizona Mogollon-Rome plateau.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, which may fall to 2.5 to 5 centimetres of precipitation, precipitation can reach up to 10 centimetres.
For areas that will be bypassed by storm surges, the rain caused by hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, as the region has long suffered from drought.
While storm floods may be dangerous, heavy rains can ease the dry season that does not take place in the Southwest.
According to U.S. Drught Monitor maps, more than 40% of Arizona’s territory is experiencing at least severe drought (the second largest category), reports Web.com.
First, hurricane Rosa hits the Mexican state of Baja California.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane with a maximum speed of 137 km/h is 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, heading north at 19 km/h.
The hurricane found itself in an area with cooler waters on the Pacific coast and is thus losing its strength.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rains with the threat of flooding are expected to occur.
“In the area from Lower California to the northwest, Sonora can reach 7–10 centimetres of rainfall, up to 25 centimetres,” reports the web site weather.com.
Then Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico and early Tuesday morning will reach the Arizona border in the tropical cyclone category, from Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The main potential risk associated with hurricane Rose and its remnants is the heavy rains in Lower California, in the north-western part of Sonora, and in the desert areas of the south-west of the United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
The rainfall is expected to cause dangerous flash floods, mudfalls in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four suspects detained for attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was seriously stabbed and three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were detained on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. on Saturday morning.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area, as reported by Avon County Police and Somerset.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to the crime who have any video of the incident on their mobile phone.
Donald Trump: "Cavanaugh's "all hatred, all anger" of the Democrats has broken out."
“The voice for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the Democrats,” Trump stated at a rally of his associates in Whiling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, in the process of approving Kavanaugh’s nomination for the candidate, “all hatred, all anger” of the Democratic Party collapsed.
On Thursday, Cavanaugh testified before the U.S. Congress, categorically rejecting the accusation by Christine Blazy Ford that he sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that that day “the American people saw a brilliant mind, class and courage” Cavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Cavanaugh's confirmation is a vote for one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, with an unscathed State record,” the President announced to a crowd of his associates in West Virginia.
In his speech, the President indirectly raised the issue of Cavanaugh's nomination, referring to the importance of Republicans standing for election to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“Before the most important elections in our lives, there are only five weeks left.
I'm not part of them, but I'm part of the race in another way," he said.
“I wear like a burned-out and fight for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task of “resisting us with all their strength”.
According to the regulations, the first key vote in the Senate to confirm Cavanaugh should take place no later than Friday, as reported by the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of casualties continues to rise.
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, and many had been swept away by the giant waves that had taken over the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which had been hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims were hundreds of visitors to a beach festival in Palou, where the coast was set to set off on Friday, with waves nearly six metres high, which smote everything in their path and led to the immediate death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of running into hiding immediately and lost their lives as a result,” Suthopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority, reported during a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, there were cars, logs, whole houses, the elements destroyed everything in their path,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami had crossed the ocean at 497 km/h and hit the coast with all its might.
Some of those present rose to the trees, saving their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
The aerial photographs of the disaster management department show destroyed houses, shops, bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by underground shocks.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Statement of the Technology Assessment and Use Agency of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) states that the energy released by the earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected because of the geographical location of the city at the end of the long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “large-scale”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
Under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, the bodies of the dead were found; a total of 540 people were injured and 29 others were reported missing.
Nugroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even greater along the coast to 300 km from Palu, in the area of Dungala, which was closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications with Dungala were “totally destroyed, no information was received”.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the Dungala area,” reports the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already travelled to the disaster zone.
“A tragedy has occurred, but that is not the limit,” the report says.
On Saturday, the Authority was severely criticized for failing to report the tsunami to Palu in time, but the authorities believed that the waves had reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
On social media, there was an amateur video in which a man on the top floor of the building shouted about the impending tsunami, desperately trying to attract people’s attention on the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water is thrown down on the shore, carrying entire houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of the video.
Earthquake and tsunami caused major electrolysis, causing communications to disappear in Pala, making rescue operations very difficult.
Military transport aircraft with humanitarian assistance were dispatched from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still lack food and basic necessities, as reported by Government sources.
The city airport was only open for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the Pala evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
This is a very bad situation.
World Vision volunteers arrived safely from Dungala to Palou, where staff found shelter in tarp tents broken up in the yard of their office building, and Doseba Sinai said that a terrible picture of total destruction appeared on the way to their eyes.
“They saw so many destroyed houses,” he says.
This is a very bad situation.
Charitable organizations have begun to put in place humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that international NCBs have not been able to reach Pala.
Indonesian law allows funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign workers to be mobilized only after the site of the disaster has been declared a national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed to be a local disaster,” reports Auliha Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares a natural disaster to be national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but so far the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that shook Pala, the friends and relatives of the missing still hope for their miraculous salvation, which will restore the people’s faith in the best.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued when he fell into a sewer hatch.
On Sunday, the rescue workers removed a woman from the wreckage of the building, who spent two days there next to her mother's dead body.
Handon Subando, the Indonesian national paraplanerism coach, trained two of the missing pilots for the recent Indonesian Asian Games.
Among the other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandaga.
“I am not the last person in this sport, and it is emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
He remembers learning about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel from other paraplanerists, and over the next hours he desperately tried to contact whatsApp with his colleagues from Pala, who were resting at the beach festival.
However, his messages were displayed with one grey tick, not two blue.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he believes.
A daring theft of $26,750 during the maintenance of the ATM in Newport on Livi
On Friday morning, the intruders stole $26,750 from the Bank's cashier, who runs an ATM in Newport on Livi, says in a press release from the Newport Police.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of an armored minibus took cash from an ATM located in the entertainment complex and was going to fill it with new banknotes.
At that time, “a Blink's employee was approached from behind by an intruder” and stole a bag of banknotes to refuel the ATM.
According to witnesses to the incident, several suspects had fled the crime scene, but the police had not indicated the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information about these individuals are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Ye.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West 41-year-old has been wearing this alias for a long time and even put it in the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
News of this came in advance of Kanye's appearance in the "Saturday Night Live", where he plans to introduce his new album "Yandhi".
Kanye West will co-host Ariana's singer, who cancelled due to “emotional anxiety,” reports the author.
West had previously stated that the pseudonym was not only an abbreviated version of his name, but also had a religious meaning.
"Ye is the most common word in the Bible, meaning 'you', 'you'," so West explained the title of his album in a recent interview to Big Boy's radio host.
“I mean, I'm you, I'm us.
At first was Kanye, which means "the only one," and now I'm just Ye, which is a reflection of all the good, the bad, the incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to think about who we are."
Kanye's not the first famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or just Diddy, this year asked me to call myself Love ("Love") or Brasa Love ("Brother Love" or "Brother Love").
He and West rapper J.Z. also changed his name several times, with or without hyphens, capital letters, or lowercase letters.
The President of Mexico solemnly vows not to use military force against the civilian population
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico vowed never to use military force against the civilian population in the run-up to the fiftieth anniversary of the student demonstration, which ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatolco Square, President López Obrador promised “never to resort to the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired at the crowd and the massacre began, killing 300 people, against the backdrop of the rise of left-wing student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also pledged support to Mexican youth through a monthly scholarship for studies and the opening of more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people directly into the criminal world.
The US needs to double funding for AI development.
China and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (I.I.I.) should not be underestimated — the US should double its investment in its scientific development, considering Lee Kaifu, an investor and an I.I. entrepreneur with Google, Microsoft, and Apple experience.
In the past, several U.S. ministries have made statements about AI work, although the US as a whole does not have a clear strategy for AI development.
At the same time, China presented its own plan as early as last year: its goal is to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
“A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking forward to the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
A doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big achievement of AI will be made in the US, said Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in China's AI, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie-Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest player in the American Othello, and then was head of Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
Lee mentioned previous US government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be held to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It is not China that absorbs academic leaders, it is corporations,” Lee is convinced.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the US develop artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan to develop the next generation's artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to scientists in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is said by Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has taken no action in this direction for several months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of Northern Macedonia”, which would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on the proposal of a new name, but the nationalist opponents argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President Giorgi Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether voter turnout would be within the 50 per cent minimum required for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Supporters of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after Yugoslavia’s dissolution, should pay the price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Oliver of George, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament stated that they would respect the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority of the members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Yose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which will open the way for her to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, age 54, prepared a small scene by placing chairs in front of tents set by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and EU membership, but we want to unite with our head held high, rather than the floors of the cabinets,” Kawadarkov says.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the investments in Macedonia that were so necessary in that country, where the unemployment rate was over 20 per cent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “a pledge to our prosperous future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia revealed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that was below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy per cent of this number claims to vote positively.
In order for the referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The collapse of the referendum will be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western Government since it came to power last May.
See, Sergio Aguero of Manchester City beats Brighton's defense to score a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling took down Brighton's defense, bringing Manchester City to a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Ethyhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored a goal on the 65th minute, it seemed like he had no problem with it.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a pass at the center of the field.
He ran between three of Brighton's defenders before breaking into the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one of the defenders and beat several more on the edge of Brighton's penalty zone.
Then he handed the ball over to Sterling on the left.
The English attacker, while in the punishment zone, returned the Aguero ball to one touch, which struck Matthew Ryan, the goalkeeper of Brighton, with his right leg, at the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero is having some problems with his legs,” said Coach Manchester City, Pep Guardiola.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave Heaven Blue an initial advantage in the Premier League’s struggle.
That goal was scored on the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero got the ball, deep down in Brighton territory.
He gave an excellent cut-off on the left flank on Leroy Sana.
Sane made a few touchings before giving Sterling a hand-over to the farst bar.
The attacker of the Blue Sky struck the ball at the gate just before flying out of the field.
Manchester City fought Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. on Rein-Nekkar Aren in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer's going to take his glasses off the Colorado Rockis.
After Washington Nationals dropped out of playoffs, there was little reason to force events.
But the indefatigable Sherzer hopes to win the fight against the Colorado Rockis on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division, have problems in the playoffs.
The 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night has already won at least 7 or 8 places, but they still hope to secure their title in the first division.
“Although we play for nothing, at least we can hold positions knowing the great importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of viewers and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?"
Nationals has yet to announce a pitcher on Sunday, but recent evidence suggests that Scherzer is likely to play that role.
Sherzer, who's going to go to game 34, threw a ball on Thursday at the pitcher park, and Sunday, on his weekend, he's going to be a pitcher.
The Washington right-hand pitcher statistics are 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 outs in 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
Trump's running the West Virginia election race.
Referring to the importance of the Republican presence in the mid-term elections, the President implicitly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate put forward by the President to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's very, very important. I don't run, although I do run everywhere fighting for good candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by whatever means they need, and we're seeing the scorn and the abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to cross to gain power and control, which is what they want — power and control, but we're not going to give them.”
The Democrats, he claims, were set out to “resist and obstruct”.
“And you've been watching this for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “wrong, mean, ugly, and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Law Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Dayann Feinstein, which sparked a lot of noise from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the contents of this document?
Mm-hmm, what document?
No, no, the body's tongue gave it away, I've never seen the body's language so disprove words."
The Labour Party is no longer an organization of different views.
It does not tolerate those who express their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party proposed a vote of no confidence in me, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last member of Parliament from the Labour Party to be told that we are not welcome for expressing our views.
A similar attitude towards my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin in a vote of no confidence.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, and Europe are ironically matters on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice of the Nottingham Eastern Labour Meeting on Friday stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the time of my eight years as a local member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC Friday evening meetings were just like this.
Unfortunately, today's tone does not match those many meetings, and the promise of a “more human and softer” policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
The fact that there are no differences of opinion in the Labour Party is becoming more and more evident, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the party ' s leadership.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues, whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own, expected me to change my views and to take positions that I would never agree to — be they national security or EU single market issues.
Every time I speak publicly — and no matter what I say — social media has a tirade of insults calling for the cancellation of elections condemning the centre's policies, or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And this isn't just happening to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments to me do tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who face a daily stream of sexual or racist attacks, but who never retreat.
What is most disappointing about this policy is that such a number of insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that “broad church,” and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes a party.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations calling on me to sit down and cut down, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago, as a student of the school, outraged by the disparaging attitude of the Thatcher government, which literally broke up my schoolroom, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need them most — whether as a local deputy or as a government minister.
I never hid my political views, I didn't do it in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this motion on Friday, I would like to say that our country is moving so hard towards Brexit, which is guaranteed to cause economic, industrial and State damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to cancel the election results or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I see fit in your interest.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
R 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Air comes first
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but "E" no doubt earned a triumph in this remarkably interesting game of the Tenent Premier League.
Now they're leading the table, the only invincible team of ten.
After all, all because of their excellent protection, as well as their ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merchi every right to be satisfied.
“All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” Peter Merchi commented.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's worth it, they've done better than us."
Grant Anderson’s 14-minute attempt, carried out by Fraser Climo, led Air forward, but the yellow card released for Voorors to Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to move forward, and Jason Baggott grabbed on to an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Air's penalty break before making a point in the middle of the game, and then during the break he made a single attempt, making score 17-5 in favour of Air.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, realized by Buggot, reduced the break to five points.
Then there was a long hiatus due to the severe trauma of Ruarid Knott, who was stretched out, and after re-exit, Air moved on with Stafford McDowell's attempt by Climo.
The current captain of Air Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose was forced to pay another player for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
However, the owners returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the incoming Ar moth.
Climo realized the advantage, not stopping almost from returning, after Kyle Rowe got hit by David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's extreme attacker to the fifth attempt by the field owners.
Still Game star is about to start a new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game Star Ford Kieran is about to start working in the hotel industry, and it has become known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, which he writes for, and is filmed with a long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphyll.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth episode would be the last on the show, and it looks like Kiernan is planning a life after Craigling.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was planning to participate in the “prosperous restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: Land-locked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Seafarers patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are described with the slogan: “Our seas are ours.
It is our duty to return it.”
Throughout Bolivia, which is landlocked, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century over resources is still alive; it is alive and eager to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been the bravest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of an international court on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and a balance of mind, and, of course, there is a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the decision-making process at the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal at The Hague will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous President of Bolivia, who is fighting a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also anxiously awaiting a decision to be delivered on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he argued at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia, and if it does, it will make little difference.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands had no authority over Chilean territory and had already stated that it would have no influence on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was rendered only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case was “not complicated”, says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Over the past four years, Bolivia's case has not progressed, but on the contrary, it has been postponed.
“The current administration of Bolivia has used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarathe says.
According to her, Morales’ militant rhetoric had destroyed the last Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct discussions thereafter.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, Bolivia ' s representative in The Hague, did not agree that the judgement had been delivered too quickly.
Monday will offer Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to put an end to 139 years of mutual differences,” he argues.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, uses the naval issue as a political bargaining chip.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he claims.
“The decision of the court is an opportunity to make sure that we go beyond our past.”
North Korea claims there will be no nuclear disarmament until it can trust the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho states that his country will never destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of renewed nuclear stalemate more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri claims that the dream that long sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever bring the North to its knees is utopia.
Washington fears the adoption of this declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But the scepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the abandonment of an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows show the latest line of massive headgears that promise to appear in mass sale and will be worn right next to you.
If you want to add hats to your collection or completely shield yourself from sunlight, there's no need to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual headdresses that form part of their SS19 collection and blinded visitors to the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, highly impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and the designers decided to send their stunning works to the podium.
Valentino, a distinctive example of a beige headgear decorated with broad fields like feathers, was painted on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included precious watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple, but all of these headdresses are not designed to warm their heads in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of fancy masks, which had to be very close to Halloween.
Many of these pristine masks had their mouth sewn up, and they were more like Hannibal Lecter's portrait than a couture creation.
One of the copies was like underwater swimming equipment with tubes and protective glasses, and the other was like melting ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion critics predict that these giant hats have every chance of breaking into the mass sale, directly to you.
The hats are huge in size and are on the heels of the La Bomba, a straw hat with two foot wide fields that everyone else has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cultural label that released this extremely impractical hat, which gained such widespread popularity on social media, created and sent out another huge accessory to the podium, a straw beach bag, almost as large as a swimsuit model carrying the bag.
An orange bag of burnt rafia with a white leather pen and a Rafia border became a vivid copy of the Jacquemus La Riveira SS19 collection on the Paris Fashion Week.
The Stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: "I think big hats and beach bags will appear in mass sale next summer. As the designer has produced such a fury with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue their tradition of brilliant education, which was reaffirmed in 2018: the outstanding results of the examinations have demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), with more than 30,000 students all over Scotland seeking to provide the highest level of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for further higher education, their career choices and the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for developing and implementing an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you speak to his heart.”
This is a strong indication that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships with and trust citizens of other countries.
From this year ' s latest examinations, we see that languages are at the forefront of the league tables and have the highest score in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages received the highest “A” rating.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of pupils received "A" in Mandarin (Chinese non-meaning), while 72 per cent of students in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish also received "A".
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland foreign languages are clearly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Language subjects are now in the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that among the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were due to language skills.
Language skills are thus increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession the pupil chooses, if he learns a second language, he will gain a real advantage in the future by learning another additional skill that will be useful for him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows more than one foreign language a competitive advantage.
According to a YouTube survey in which over 4,000 British adults participated in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak English well enough to support conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage, with 15 per cent of respondents speaking it.
That is why investing in language education is so relevant now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, would give children a better chance of finding a good job.
Scotland has a wide range of languages that are taught — each school has a different set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to Britain in the light of the future of the country until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland seek to create an environment that will train children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of their future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital for the future development of the country in the global business environment, and this should therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages need to be seen as “skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, which provides diversity and benefits for Scottish youth.
Il faut ben le faire.
John Edwards, Director, Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron debuts at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The painful expectation of fans to see LeBron James perform for the first time at Los Angeles Lakers almost came to an end.
The Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James would play in a pre-season Sunday match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still have to figure out how much time he's got to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” Walton replied on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games on the Lakers chart.
“I do not need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare for the season,” the player answers.
West Virginia Trump Select Race, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of campaign meetings tonight in Whiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five scheduled Trump meetings next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his candidate for the post of Chief Justice had been postponed, Trump was seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risked losing control of Congress if the vote were held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia meeting tonight, and how can we watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Whiling, West Virginia, will take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting with West Virginia voters online on YouTube live.
Trump is likely to speak at the hearing this week for the nomination of his candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, for the post of Chief Justice, and the offer of Trump to do so has given rise to many negative reactions, as Cavanaugh has been charged with sexual harassment, and the vote to be held in the Senate will be postponed for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this action is to help the Republicans who are coming to the November elections to increase their pace.
President Trump’s campaign is thus aimed at ensuring that these five meetings, to be held next week, help to “energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, Reuters writes.
“Control of Congress is so important to its agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible, as we enter a tense campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesperson, who refused to be named, reports Reuters.
Today’s Wesbanco Arena campaign in Whiling can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract Pittsburgh’s media attention, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Visiting Trump in West Virginia this Saturday is the second visit to the state in the last month, because it was here that he gained an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump's trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisy, who's behind the polls.
“The fact that Morrisi has to come in front of the competition in the polls is not a good sign for Morrisi himself,” says Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Championship 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates a willingness to fight and holds hope by going to a match match on Sunday.
After three one-off sessions, Saturday's two-by-two game might have been exactly what Ryder's Cup needed.
The rolling initiative is an exceptional fictional sports concept, but it is one that the players believe in, and it is particularly pronounced in such competitions.
So who has the initiative?
“They had an advantage of six points, and now four, so I guess it's a small initiative for us,” Jordan sleeps leaving.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and 12 more on the line.
The Americans, in Spith's view, feel the wind in the sails, and they have reason to keep their spirits up, not least because of the form of Spith and Justin Thomas playing together all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Sleeping was impenetrable from tee to green, setting a personal example.
Victory cheers got louder as his round continued, with the key ball thrown into the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas gave two by two.
His blow, which gave them a win on the 15th hole, was met by a similar cry, one of the ones who said he believed in a chance for the American team.
“It is necessary to get together and focus only on your game,” Spit commented.
That's all that's left for the players right now.
Walk 18 holes and become winners.
The only players who have earned more points than Sleep and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have undeniably entered the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe knocked four out of four, and they seem to know no mistakes.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't recruit the gods on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and, again, Friday morning.
Such a series, and the way in which their energy seems to circulate between them and violent fans, reinforces the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun is hidden beyond the horizon of the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous player that consolidates Europe’s potential victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It'd be great if both of them were on different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of Europe’s glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took down Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The Boggs and two double gods dug the Spaniard and the Swedish hole on the first nine holes, from which they could never get out.
So on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your pit.
It's so exciting to watch the four-ball game and the four-player game because of the interaction between the two, the advice they exchange, and the deliberate silence, and how the strategy can change overnight.
So far, Europe has played better as a team, and has gone a long way forward on the last day, but this session of the four has also shown that the US team has all the strength to fight, in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6.
Europe will gain a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the end of Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games, with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National score to four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to recover a trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the mistaken American team in the four-ball game in the morning, winning the 3-1 score.
The U.S. has been more resistant to the four, winning two matches, but they have not been able to close the account gap.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points out of 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second couple to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they formed an excellent alliance to defeat the fallen spirit of Woods and American novice Bryson Dechebmo with an even stronger 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturdays, showed periodic glimmers, but now he has lost 19 out of 29 games in four and four in seven.
Justin Rose, who rested before the four-ball game in the morning, returned to Henrik Stanson's four-way partner, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kapp, with a score of 2/1, ranked first and third in the world.
For Europe, however, the game did not become an easy and pleasant walk a refreshing day southwest of Paris.
Two points of reference for Americans, earned three times by Jordan Spy and Justin Thomas on Saturday.
They won a strong 2/1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game and came back later to beat Polter and Rory Mcilroy in a four-thirds score, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did the team get out of the gap by four points, going out alone, considering that Ferik's team, as owners, had to play a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding the second seat, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it's beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that “adamantly” will not be unilaterally disarmed without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea had stated at the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions increased mistrust of the United States and that his country would under no circumstances renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Young-ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures of good will” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the commitment not to build up nuclear weapons and not to develop nuclear technology.
“However, we are not seeing a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to take unilateral action on disarmament.”
While Ri repeated North Korea's previous complaints about Washington's “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it had not rejected unilateral denuclearization without control, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Eun and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the incumbent US President and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to start a movement towards “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”, and Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea seeks to formally end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States states that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists calls to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that “denuclearization must take place first” and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to enforce its purpose, and even opposes the “declaration of the end of war”, says Re.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a utopian dream of people who don't know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions increase our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea, not the US, was the party to this issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a deadlock.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech differed sharply from that of last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on the US mainland was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim “a suicide rocket.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said that it did not indicate any time frame for the process: “Does it take two years, three years, or five months?”
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council's imposition of sanctions must continue actively and necessarily until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to cut off the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly summit and announced after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandit demands”.
North Korea promised, at a meeting with Moon this month, to dismantle the missile system, as well as the nuclear complex, should the United States, for its part, take “relevant measures”.
According to him, Kim told him that the “relevant measures” he referred to were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students go on vacation in special courses
The new course introduced this year at Harvard University has helped all elementary students to learn to sleep more and to fight the chauvinist culture of continuous caffeine consumption in order to stay awake overnight.
One of the academics found that the world’s most successful students often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that, in his view, is the first of its kind in the United States.
After his opening, he was caught up in the idea of introducing such a course, giving a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl approached me and said, ‘It’s a shame that I only learned about it now that I’m about to graduate.’
She said that no one had ever told her the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first offered to students this year, shows how a healthy sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as how it improves the general well-being of the individual.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the University's Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after it had been determined that the students suffered from a serious sleep deficit during the school week.
The class lasts one hour and students perform a number of interactive assignments.
One section of the class offers an image of the dormitory room, where students press coffee cups, curtains, simulators, and books to learn how each of these actions and substances — coffee, the light that causes sleep deprivation — affects sports outcomes, and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The interactive map of campus encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behaviour of students at once.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as any other person has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health,” added Professor Chaisler.
According to him, the false sense of pride that a person can “sniff all night” is still quite widespread, and modern technology, as is the growing pressure on students, means that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
He said that enough sleep of good quality was a student’s “secret weapon” to cope with stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to control overweight, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of starvation, making it constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaser develop the course by attending one of his first years at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar training programme before entering a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students install an alarm clock that warns them to go to sleep and wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which disrupts the human biothythmology and leads to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Gol Menga wins Gerrard's team
The Rangers survived another sad retreat, as Dolly Menga's goal led Stephen Gerrard's uncooperative team to a 1:0 defeat in Livingstone.
Ibrox's team was hoping to win their first exit victory after a 4:1 win in February in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only defeated Gerrard in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving an easy victory to the Harts team, the leaders of the Scottish Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost their spirits, did not seem to be going to settle the score.
While the Rangers now went down to sixth place, the Livingston went up to third place, and only the Hibernian gave in to the score of the beaten heads.
And Rangers may have additional problems after Line Judge Kalum Spence had to heal the head wound after some object was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight replacements for the team that went through the "R" in the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt followed the same Livy 11 strategy that widened the gap with the Hartes last week, and he would be happy to see his well-meaning composition closing up adversaries at every step.
The Rangers may have been leading the sword, but the Livingstons were squeezed a lot more when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to score a goal in just two minutes when Meng's first show to Scott Pittman stopped Allan McGregor, but the quarterback took the chance.
Keegan Jacobs took a hit on Team Captain Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, was only able to send the ball to the far end.
Rangers intercepted control, but in the last third there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he had to strike a fine for 45 minutes when he and Stephen Lawless ran into each other, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers made only two strikes in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassan Coulibaly's head, and the weak strike by Ovi Ejaria.
Although Livi's first goal, beaten at 34 minutes, may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they earned it exclusively by their own work.
But again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' standard position.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to hand the ball over to Menga for completion.
Gerrard began to act on the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately came to fruition when the last quarterback gave the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to intercept.
But Livingstone continued to drag the guests into their intended game with Litgow and Hulkett, constantly making long broadcasts.
Holt's team tried to increase the breakout in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Litgow gave the transmission from the corner of the field.
The reserve Rangers player, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a penalty after he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson again refused.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page of our almanac, Sunday morning: on September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
As one of the fundamentals of science, Geiger's enumerator has also become one of the pillars of popular culture, and this is reflected in the 1950s film "Coronado Colcol", with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — seemingly unlike scientists — in the main roles:
The man said, "What the hell is this thing?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms caused by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "Here, I can hear you right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, but did not live until a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after its author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see abnormally growing cells and kill them.
Part of the treatment of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them under laboratory conditions.
As a result of this change, cells are able to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many types of cancer, then the cells must be re-induced.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One of the patients who introduced the vaccine, and whose immune system has learned to recognize abnormal cells, has had ovarian cancer in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” the Her2 protein, which is characteristic of many types of cancer, and then re-inject the modified cells into the patient.
Professor J. Berzofski, U.S. National Cancer Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, says, "The results we've received suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
Professor Berzofski explains that HER2 "stimulates the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer.
A similar method was successfully applied in the treatment of leukemia, which consisted in the withdrawal of immune cells from patients and their “education” as to how cancer cells should be affected.
Kanye West defended Trump in the MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was in the studio during a Saturday concert in which he spoke in defence of US President Donald Trump, claiming that he would take up that position again in 2020.
After performing his third song, "The Ghost City", which he performed, he put on the hat "Let's make America great again", the performer gave a speech against the Democrats and supported Trump.
"I talk to white people very often, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America long ago,” the performer said.
SNL made a parody show with Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Christine Blacey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
There was no television showing how the crowd was outraged by West’s remarks, but the video was uploaded on social media by Chris Rock.
Now it's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West with that move.
In addition, West complained to the public that his hat had been ridiculed backstage.
"They were making fun of me behind the stage.
They say don't come out in that hat.
They were really messing with me!
Washington Examiner quotes his words, "And they also said that my position is not cool."
West goes on, "Do you want to know that it's not cool to put on a Superman cape so no one can tell you what to do? Do you want the world to continue to grow?
Then you need love."
His comments, at least twice, caught the audience’s attention, the members of the SNL cast seemed confused, and one person said to the publication, “The entire studio has fallen into silence.”
West was last-minute invited to replace singer Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love it" in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candice Turner, who tweeted, "One of the bravest people: Thank you for supporting many."
Karen Hunter, the host of the talk show, tweeted that West was just "who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
“However, I do not want to support anyone (buying their music, clothing or otherwise supporting their creativity) who, in my view, shares and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Duddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dog, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and another example, of course, is the artist who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted murder for stabbing at Belfast Restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of stab wounds on Friday at a restaurant in the east of Belfast.

The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
"Game of Thrones" star Keith Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is known for his role as the sword-blowing John Snow in the cruel medieval fictional HBO series "The Game of Thrones".
Recently, however, a 31-year-old actor has strongly criticized the macho character stereotype, saying that such characters often inspire young people to think that to be respected, you must necessarily be cruel.
In his interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his co-worker in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, his age, admitted that he was “very interested” in the problem.
“I personally take this question very seriously: Where are we wrong about the perception of masculinity?” the actor asks.
"What do we teach growing up kids that we have this problem today?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for this spike in toxic masculinity because of the muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is inborn and what is acquired?
What do they teach on TV and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they should show only one particular side of masculinity?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because there's something really wrong with young people today.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any pretzels or sequels of the Game of Thrones, after the series ended next summer, claiming that he had “completed battles and horses.”
From November on, Keith will play a leading role in Sam Shepherd's newly filming "The East West", reporting on the film's producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes that meeting Rose's wife is the best finale of "The Game of Thrones" for him.
"I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my future life," says the actor.
Rose played The Gamer, a subject of passion for the character Keith John Snow in a Fenthesia series won by Emmy.
The couple celebrated the wedding in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, sexually transmitted diseases are indicative of changing trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, this was the way in which the number of HIV infections was reduced to virtually zero, and Chinese health-care officials announced at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is still widespread.
Studies confirm that, because of the country ' s conservative values, 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to the lack of protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters is refuting information leaks from Republican senators complaining about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
Member of the U.S. Parliament Maxine Waters rejected the charges on Saturday that one of her staff members posted personal information from three Republican senators on the pages of the legislators' Wikipedia.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the lawsuits were forged by “ulterior” experts and websites.
“Leaves, lies, and even worse lies,” Waters tweets.
The published information reportedly includes the home addresses and telephone numbers of United States senators Lindsay Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during hearings before the Senate Commission on Sexual Harassment Allegations against a Supreme Court candidate, Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after three senators interviewed Cavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to Waters' office, and released information about Waters' employees, Hill reports.
“This unfounded allegation is totally false,” Waters assures us.
“A member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent acts, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded allegation is a complete lie.”
Waters' statement immediately provoked criticism on the Internet, including by former White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for work in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why get angry?
You don't have to make excuses either.
And you shouldn't be looking into the motives of the prosecutors either.
We must remain calm and cold.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters in the midterm election, also tweeted his thoughts.
“If that is true, it is very important,” he writes.
In her statement, Waters writes that her office warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent acts.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are found,” she writes, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which can be devastating and dangerous to all my employees.”
Johnny English strikes again — a weak parody of a spy, Rowan Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to find the meaning of Brexit in any new film that in one way or another includes Britain; this is also the case of the new parody spy franchise "Agent Johnny English", which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film "Agent Johnny English: Rebooting".
Will a self-pairing picture with a leitmotif “clearly that we're all shit” be a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, the eye-eyed profan Johnny English with a rubber face was granted his right to chaos for the second time — his name is the most vivid hint that he is a wide-screened comic work intended for a non-English film audience.
A hero, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his whimsical claims about glamorous smoothies, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's traits, and a portion of this guy who made one single note to the charios of Fire at the 2012 opening ceremony of the Olympics in London.
Originally, the character was built on the identity of the traveler and the mysterious "international" Atkinson, who once played in the forgotten television commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero left a complete mess.
This last issue of JE has one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the blades were lashing on his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift of physical performance of comedy scenes, but humor itself seems rather weak and strangely redundant, especially because “serious” film tests such as “Agent 007” and “Mission Unable” now offer comedy as an element.
It feels like humor is for children, not adults, and for me, Johnny English's whimsical evils are not as ingenious and appropriate as Atkinson's jokes in Mr. Bean movies.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated a top-secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of duty agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately got an occasional role.
This is the last straw for a prime minister, a pompous and assertive figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for the character Quasi-Treza-May, but there's nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that, since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to remove someone from retirement.
And here on stage is the clumsy Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolteacher at some pontoon institution, but also gives unofficial lessons in undercover operations: there are some good jokes here, as English offers the skills of a rock-style spy academy.
English returns to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunites with his former unlucky buddy Buff, who is also playing this time, Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man under the command of a submarine, the role of "fun hockey clubs" in which Vicki Pepperdin loses a little bit.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because of the terrible mistakes that have occurred in Her Majesty's secret service, and they face a beautiful, fatal woman, Ofelia Bulletova, in the performance of Olga Kurilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems — the ominous Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on the luxury Volta yacht; English breeds complete anarchy by trying to use the virtual reality garrison to familiarize themselves with the interior of the Volt's house.
All of these scenes, of course, are a nice and fancy fiction, but there's something very childish about them.
It's very moderate.
And, as with other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but wonder: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that is really commensurate with his talent?
Labour denied that they were planning to reduce British workweeks to four days for a five-day salary.
Jeremy Corbin’s Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants company managers to give employees the savings of the artificial intelligence revolution by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow staff members to enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea “puts in” on the party’s economic agenda and will help the people of the country take the side of the workers.
The Trade Union Congress has approved a four-day work week to enable workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source of the Labour Party said The Sunday Times: It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is our goal, which is consistent with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 campaign.
However, this desire is currently not approved by the majority of the Labour Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said, “The four-day working week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used a Labour conference last week to concretize his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to take power from “faceless directors” and “speculants” of utility firms.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders of water canals may not get their full share back, as the Labour Government may make “exemptions” on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and to establish Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of private sector firms' capital to workers who could receive an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Cavanaugh can change their mind.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the post of Chief Justice for at least a week and raised the question of whether the agency's findings would encourage any of the Republican senators to support Cavanaugh.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Palley interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything to make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh on my way to the hearing.
I called him after it happened, and I came up with this information, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His answer was strong, definite and unequivocal.”
But Graham's opinion on the vote remained unshakeable.
“I have made a firm decision about Brett Cavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments that are comparable to dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing I know for sure: Brett firmly denied all of this,” Graham added, turning to Christine Blacey Ford.
“No one whom she called as witnesses could confirm these facts either.
It's been 36 years.
And I saw nothing new in it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City — an annual musical event that involves an impressive stellar force with an equally impressive mission — the end of poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year, the Festival of World Citizens, like tens of thousands of people, flows to the great lawn of the Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to highlight the real goal of the exercise: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the global anti-poverty project carried out by an international group of human rights defenders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to volunteer or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a telephone call, or perform any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the World Citizens' Festival been in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people freely attending a concert really convincing fellow citizens to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “climtivism” where people believe that they make real changes by signing online petitions or tweeting messages?
Global Citizen organizers claim that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been registered at the festival by its supporters, with many different goals.
It is mentioned that, as a result of these actions, world leaders have pledged more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds allocated have directly assisted nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children to reach their full potential” promised to provide 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the district, following more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens such as you, we can make social injustice about malnutrition in the past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to encourage Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which would reach 5 million women and children through activities to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival website: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Globalcizen's organizers say, "It's gonna be a long and difficult road for us to stumble and fall from time to time.
But, as in the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Jeanel Moné, are some of the artists who will be performing at this year's event in New York, with DeBorra-Lee Ferrness and Hugh Jackman as its hosts.
The US can use the Navy to “block” Russia’s energy exports: the Minister of the Interior
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said that Washington could use its navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of the sea lanes and, if necessary, the blockade to prevent their energy from entering the market,” the Minister says.
Zinke addressed the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that views itself as a “power consumer voice” in the US.
He goes on to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and substitution of fuel,” says the minister, calling Russia a `poony with one trick', whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements were made that the Trump administration had set the goal of increasing its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which offered a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a Moscow prisoner.
In Moscow, it has been repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Northern Flow 2 project, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists, represented by the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes in our energy supply, it poses a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, will carefully explore the possibility of running for president in 2020.
The senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, announced on Saturday that she would carefully explore the possibility of running for president after the midterm election.
At a town Duma meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the election race.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that to happen, a woman is needed upstairs,” Warren The Hill says.
“After 6 November, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren assessed the performance of President Donald Trump during the meeting: “This district is in the wrong direction.”
“I'm worried sick of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump and his candidate for the post of supreme judge, Brett Cavanaugh.
On her Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before we start voting."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters did not think that she should run for office in 2020.
According to a survey by the Center for Political Studies of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts’s “probable” voters stated that the senator should not run.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the other hand, supported its plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known Democratic names that were discussed in connection with the 2020 perspective include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden claims he'll make a formal decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a meeting with Donald Trump's constituents.
Track Palin, 26 years old, joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same experiences as other family members suffering from PTSD and having been injured, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as “white in the eye” and said of her son and other war veterans: “They are coming back as others, stoned, wondering whether their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military personnel have the same respect as they have given their country.”
Trak Palin was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with the situation of violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support the challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and D.C. support legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that prohibits shelter for victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and counties filed an analytical note on Friday in Washington, D.C., by a court consultant on support for an asylum-seeker challenging policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the "Grace v Sessions" suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons, who are members of a criminal group” ill-treated her, but on 20 July U.S. officials rejected her asylum request.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala submit a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney-General of Columbia, Carl Racine, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “regards decades of application of State, federal and international law”.
“The federal law requires that all applications for asylum be examined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle,” states the report of the judicial adviser.
Lawyers also argue that policies that prohibit immigrants are detrimental to the US economy, emphasizing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labour”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sashns ordered immigration judges no longer to grant safe haven to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“Shelter will be given to those who leave their country for persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sashns said in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument has never been designed to address all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate efforts to save lives in Pala: the number of deaths doubles in search of survivors
For survivors, the situation became more and more difficult.
“It’s very difficult,” says Risa Kusum’s 35-year-old mother, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in the wounded.
Clean water in large shortages.”
Residents go back to their destroyed homes, dig into wet things and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overburdened.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, rested outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated in the open because they were forced to leave because of continuing severe shocks.
He cries, remembering how a powerful earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor that he was filming with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I’ve been squeezed into the walls, ” explains Haris Associated Press, explaining that his family came to town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they're safe, and they're fine now.”
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “aggression” through “promotional propaganda”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page commercial in a daily American newspaper highlighting the mutual benefits of US and Chinese trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to a fee-paying supplement to the Des Moines Register China Daily, Iowa's largest commercial newspaper, accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 election, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US election is a confirmation of the fact that US officials told Reuters that a new phase is taking place in Washington’s growing campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to advertise for the promotion of trade, Beijing and Washington are now in a state of escalation of the trade war, as a result of which they equalize tariffs on imports of their countries.
China’s back tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Trump Party, with Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claims that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this harassment by placing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of our heart’s American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and posting ads on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“However, in the newsstands here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices and see the true diversity of opinions that Chinese would be able to learn about China’s alarming economic policies, since local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of China's best-known newspapers had been “closely disavowed” from the invitation to publish his article, although he did not give the exact title of the publication.
Analytics warn: by the destruction of Cavanaugh, Republicans repulsed women voters before the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stand aside and defend the candidacy of Supreme Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, that may affect the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the situation have become hotter, and most Republicans have officially declared that they want to continue voting.
You can’t go back to such things later, ” writes Grant Rier, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Reer doubts that attempts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI at the very last minute will suffice to calm angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the MoveOn progressive group, Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November ahead!" across from the Senate, when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run for Cavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blacey Ford's testimony, reported to Mic.
“Democracy’s enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond that,” stated a non-partisan political scientist Stu Rothenberg on the news site.
“People say the situation is already getting pretty hot, and that's true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of women voters in the suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against a Supreme Judge candidate, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirmed the nomination, it might trigger a reaction.
“This is already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steel, former chairman of the Republican National Committee early last week, as NBC News reports.
“The question is not only about voting in the committee or the final vote, or whether Cavanaugh sat on the dock, but also about how the Republicans handle it, how they treat it,” says Guy Cecile, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, a news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have been somewhat divided on the question of who to believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, and tending to side with the latter.
A new YouTube survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony accurately or most likely, while 35 percent say they believe Cavanaugh accurately or most likely.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Cavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the charges against Ford, and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports to The Guardian.
Last week, under oath, Ford testified before the Senate Legal Committee that Cavanaugh, in a state of intoxication, attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of supreme judge showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that competes with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to give access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that Inrupt’s goal was to gain “world domination.”
“We must do it now,” he says about his start-up.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “personal online data repositories” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, case lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application operates on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of which can be used in the same browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online data warehouse is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data”.
According to John Bruce's CEO, Inrupt's idea is that the company has provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently comprises Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a volunteer programmer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said that he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether his companies should make drastic changes that would completely change all their business models overnight.
“We do not ask their permission.”
In his post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lea wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Lee's voice has been quite influential in the debate about neutrality online.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee says.
Bernard Vann: Church minister awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded Victoria's cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his involvement in the attack on Bellenglis and Leukour.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
The commemoration was inaugurated by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "very symbolic," that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the canal of Saint-Kanten “in a very thick fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns”.
He later ran into the line of fire and led the group forward with the “greatest courage” and then threw a field gun with one hand, shooting down three unit soldiers.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero Michael Vann said that "he could hardly do the same heroicly, but it's humbled."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honour for him to participate in the parade” and added that “the valor of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given by many people.”
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead, they were shown Peppa pig.
Imagine you were up all night watching a full Bellator 206, but you weren't allowed to see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 battles, including six main programme battles, and the fights were broadcast live all night on British television channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for a meeting, British fans were stunned to see "Peppa's Pig" on screens.
Some fans weren't impressed because they didn't sleep until morning just to watch the fights.
One of the fans on Twitter called this change to a children's cartoon "a sick joke."
“A government ruling was issued that this content was inappropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Marketing and Communication, said when asked why.
"Yes, "Peppa Pig."
Bellator president Scott Coker said that they were planning to schedule so that future fights could also be seen by British viewers.
“As for the rerun, I think we can resolve this issue,” Coker says.
“But it's Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can't solve this by Sunday in our time, and for them it'll be Monday.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, there was a lot of text messages, all of which were far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, thought it was some kind of technical failure.
Turns out, no, it was a matter of national importance.
I promise you, this is not gonna happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of battles to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans, we're trying to increase that number, but we're going overboard.
Yeah, it wasn't good."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to be successful.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize that "not everyone was like him" until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program, led by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics after he had had a baby.
The regular host of Kirsty Young's multi-year show took a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who was the main guest in Laverne's program, said that he felt “more insignificant than any of his peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says, “To date, these feelings of worthlessness and indiscretion have been real, but they have given me strength, and I have succeeded.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexual orientation.
A two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a famous LGBT activist and, in his address at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he could live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope.”
Three times, the world champion said that his feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "took him off guard."
Last year, Daly married Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than him, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“If there’s so much going on in your life at this young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find a person of the same age who had the exact opposite experience.
The couple became parents in June, had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his worldviews" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win the gold medal," says the athlete.
"But you know what, there are more important things than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 of brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father didn't want to accept his death, and one of his last requests was first-line tickets to the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be around then, and you won’t be able to sit in the front row,’ says Daley.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing, I finally realized that he was not invincible,” says the athlete.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I've dreamed of my whole life — diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games, and there was no better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song, Proud by Heather Small, which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes it so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 p.m. English summertime.
Mickelson, who's not in uniform, spent this Saturday's Ryder Cup on the bench.
The American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to pull the shape up to avoid the unpleasant milestone.
Michelson, who played the Biennale for the record 12 times, was sent by Captain Jim Furick to the bench on Saturday for four balls and four quarters.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the United States, a five-time big winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of correcting his concerns.
Never having the most direct blow, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete is not the ideal candidate for the hard road Le Golf National, where a long raf usually punishes for inaccurate blows.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Michelson will meet the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, in the ninth match on Sunday, who joined with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12th and single matches make a big start, Michelson's match could be crucial.
The Ferrick expressed confidence in his partner, though he could have said something else.
“He fully understood the role assigned to him today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Ferick commented.
“He is quite confident and self-confident.
He's a walking Hall of Fame, and he's done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On Sunday, Michelson beats Nick Foldo's record for the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven drawbacks, although Ferrick said that his presence was of great benefit to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to train people, and he's a great guy who's interesting," he explained.
"I think the young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see that.
His game is much more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows in his experience that a significant level of single-handed leadership in the Ryder Cup can easily turn out to be unfavourable.
Dutchan made his debut in a match in 1997 in Walderram, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but had reached the finish line just a little ahead with the smallest difference, winning 141.5-2 to 131.5/2.
“You continue to remind yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but just now,” said Bjorn, who was photographed after watching the 2018 Classroom, winning the "Le Golf National" field with a score of 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which resulted in a score of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow, you'll be out full.
Go and do the right thing.
As long as you don't have glasses on the board, it's not over.
We have a goal, and that's the chance to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I spoke loudly, focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we already know what we're up against: the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied by the way his players appeared on their uncomfortable golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have surpassed myself in this.
We're going to have a different trial tomorrow.
We're starting our individual performances tomorrow, and that's a whole different story.
It's always nice to be with your partner when things are going well, but when you're alone, you're experiencing all your professional golfer powers.
That is the idea that the players need to be encouraged to come to terms with themselves tomorrow.
Now the partner is behind us, and he too must make every effort.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferick, believes that his players will perform better individually than their partners, except for Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
The Ferrick himself has gone through all this driveway of the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe hosted "The Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had united his players before the last day.
"We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to finish it quickly, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We've built our plan accordingly for the game and we've tuned the kids in the way we thought was right, you know? Tomorrow we'll try to do a miracle."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory Mcilroy in the top uterus with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I have chosen this group of guys, and in this order, because I think they will close down all possible flaws in this way,” Bjorn said, commenting on their choice of individual players.
The commissioning of the new German warship has been delayed again
The newest frigate of the German fleet was to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the aging cold war war ships, but this will not happen at least next year due to defective systems and avalanche cost increases, local media reports.
The entry into service of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of the brand new frigates of Baden-Württemberg, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, citing a military representative.
The ship was to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the shipment complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, they will have a powerful gun, numerous anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some “stels” technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods — the possibility of deploying the latest frigates for up to two years away from domestic ports.
Nevertheless, the constant delay in commissioning means that the most advanced warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will be obsolete by the time they are deployed, celebrating Die Zeit.
An evil frigate F125 hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet had returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media referred to a number of critical “software and hardware defects” that rendered a warship useless when used in combat.
The limitations of the software were particularly critical, as the Baden-Württemberg class would be operated by a crew of some 120 seafarers, only half of the workforce on the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the ship is too heavy to be able to produce and limit the ability of the Navy to introduce future renewals.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared with the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of anchoring the latest frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings of a reduction in German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defense committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the naval forces were in fact “ending off the supply of ships capable of deployment.”
The official said that the problem had increased over time because old ships had been taken out of service, but they had not been provided with replacement ships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates could ever be taken over by the Navy.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats.
A new study carried out in one of the highlands of Scotland is designed to show how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that the data obtained will provide a new perspective on the behaviour of unique winged mammals and will help to further the conservation of the species.
A study organized by scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will examine common non-sophies, non-soprano, and brown long-haired bats and Dobanton nightstands in Inverwewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some locations around the site to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile site surveys using manual detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screams as well as the activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the environment will then be drawn up and a report prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on the scale of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS conservation adviser, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify key areas of habitat management, such as grassland formation, as well as ways to maintain forest areas in a state that is optimal for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened with extinction because of the construction and development work that affects their habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can be dangerous, as can sticky fly tape, chemical treatment of building materials and hunting of pet cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They're using sophisticated echo-location techniques to pinpoint the obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the population of bats very seriously.
The organization has 10 trained experts who conduct regular interviews, on-site checks and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first and only Bat Reserve in Scotland at the Threave Manor in Dumfries and Gallowey, where eight out of ten species of Scottish bats live.
Real estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the perfect place for them.
"Here, in Threave, a great place for bats," he says.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all elements of a good habitat.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need for a successful existence.”
He recalled the importance of screening for bats before maintenance within private domains, since the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young people, and possibly even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by law, their destruction, harassment or destruction of their habitats are illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrelle, a Scottish bat conservation officer, is calling for public help.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many of their individual species live."
Ronaldo denies the rape charges, and his lawyers are going to sue for a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the rape charges against him, calling them "fake news," and argues that people simply "want to go for a drink" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which published charges against a football player.
Forward Portugal and Juventus were charged with raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga, who allegedly took place in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, reported to Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram video in which a footballer had 142 million followers, a few hours after the charges were reported, Ronaldo, 33, called this information "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all fake news,” claims the five-time winner of Ballon d'Or on camera.
“They just want to get their hands on my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's just part of their job.
I am a happy man, and everything is fine," adds an athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue “Spiegel” for what they called “unacceptable information on suspicions of confidentiality”, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Shertz stated that the player intended to claim compensation for “moral damages commensurate with the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorg reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed with the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that, after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell to her knees and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy but one percent a bad guy."
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it was consensual.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “aweful that she would be avenged” and feared “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman said that she was trying to change her place of residence because she continued to experience traumatic feelings as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid at Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer moved to Italian giants Yuva in a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain “will regret the car manufacturers lost forever”
The Secretary of Business and Enterprise, Greg Clark, said that Britain would “pity it forever” if Brexit lost its status as the world’s car leader after Brexit.
He also commented on information that Toyota UK informed BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker stated that the consequences of border delays in the absence of a Brexit transaction could result in job losses.
The Bernaston plant produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced almost 150,000 cars, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped,” says Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims to close the Mini factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to auto manufacturers, if there is no Brexit transaction, the supply chain will be put at high risk.
Toyota's production line is running on time, and parts for custom-made cars are supplied by British and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be disruptions at the border, which, according to industry representatives, could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store at its Derbyshire plant for more than a day, and production will therefore be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checkers plan for future relations with the EU was “accurately calibrated to avoid these border checks”.
“We need a deal. We want to make a better deal, which will allow, again, not only to succeed now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he aired on BBC Radio 4 today.
“Not only Toyota, but also other producers claim that we must be absolutely able to continue with successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to specify the duration of the cut-off, but in the longer term warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Zuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory’s union, says that the concern of the organization’s members is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can’t get them back.”
The representative of the Government says, “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU”.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed to another week, as the competition for the candidacy of Brett Cavanaugh for the post of Chief Justice continues, as the White House declared on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Müller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the elections, the links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and potential obstacles to justice on the part of the President.
Whether Trump would dismiss the Deputy Attorney General from office, thereby jeopardizing Muller’s independence, there has been a lot of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeachment by the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York City, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he “would not” fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judicial Committee, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blakey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI's complaints about Cavanaugh, which further delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it is possible that this week, and it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not given briefings at the White House since 10 September.
Leading Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to the “scenario” of television reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they play in public.”
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President holds more meetings to answer questions from journalists than any other president before him,” she added without, however, giving precise figures: “We have these figures.”
Sanders assured that briefings would continue to take place, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.”
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it's a worthy replacement for press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
Conferences exclusively for the press are rare at all.
The president's arbitrary and sometimes strange behavior in front of the journalists gathered this week in New York may be the answer to why.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers in Scotland about concerns about Brexit.
The Minister of Health addressed the EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express gratitude on behalf of the entire country and wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, wrote to staff less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of processing status applications for EU citizens serving in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued, and the expected decision is to be delivered this autumn.
However, the British Government is also intensifying preparations for a possible no-transaction scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
It is, therefore, now that I wish to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we very much want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery for the head injury.
Michael Organ of Tennessee reported that a mid-fielder of Tennessee States Tigers, Christian Abercromby, had undergone an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury on Saturday after defeating 31–27 in a match with Vanderbilt Commodores.
The chief coach of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury had been sustained shortly before the break.
“He went out to the side line and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before putting him on a stretcher and taking him to a medical examination.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercromby had had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/degree of injury yet," and Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who was only in second grade, it was the first season of Tennessee State to move out of Illinois.
On Saturday, before he left the game, he successfully grabbed five balls, which totalled 18 balls in the season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp fee when buying real estate in the UK.
Under Tori’s new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee for real estate purchases in the UK, and the additional money generated will be used to help the homeless.
This move will undo Corbin's attempts to attract young voters.
An increased stamp fee will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year in favour of homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamping fee for real estate purchases in the UK, and the additional money they receive will be used to help the homeless, which Teresa May will announce today.
This step will negate Corbin's attempts to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more affordable and to raise citizens' incomes.
An increase in stamp duty would be imposed on individuals and non-taxing firms in Great Britain, and the additional funds thus generated should stimulate the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless people.
An addition to the existing stamp collection, including an increase introduced two years ago for secondary housing and rental housing, could amount to up to 3 per cent.
Treasury expects this move to deliver up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new properties in London are purchased by non-British residents, resulting in higher prices and making it difficult for buyers buying their first dwellings to improve their housing conditions afterwards.
Many of the country's elites, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the large number of foreign buyers who, after buying housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp collection to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused major construction firms of raising real estate prices by buying land but not actually using it, and called on Ms. May to give up her housing quotas to correct the “degradable housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include rent control and cessation of unjustified eviction.
He also wants to give local governments more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “Last year, I said that I had dedicated my pioneering to fulfilling the British dream of a better life with every new generation.
And that means, among other things, solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is, however, unfair that for non-British people, as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as affordable as for hard-working British people.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the threat to some people to be out on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run Scotland."
The club's boss, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
A 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the revival of the northeastern club, which now ranks third in the first league, separating from the first three points.
This summer, he moved to St. Myrren's Stadium of Light after returning to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B hat, and that's it," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and that always attracted me back.
However, this will only be possible if I can become a successful club manager.”
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland managers, were also Dicka Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardace, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyette and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel awe in such high-profile names in such large clubs, having previously abandoned Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
The club clearly belongs to the Premier League, according to its structure and capabilities,” Coach says.
“It is not an easy task to get him out, but I will think that I have done my job only if I can bring the club back.”
Ross has served as manager for only three years, becoming first assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at Hearts' coaching headquarters.
He then helped Alloa rise from level three, and in the next season, he took St. Myrren from the lower ranks to the winners of the championship.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable today than he ever did during his gambling career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Myrren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that management was more appropriate for me than a game.
That sounds weird, because I've done well, earned a good job in this position, and I've made some progress.
But playing is harder.
There are a lot of things that need to be done weekly.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good about being a manager.
I've always wanted to lead, and now, doing so, I feel most comfortable, like a fish in the water for the rest of my adult life.”
You can listen to a full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, 30 September, on Scottish Radio from 12:00 to 1:00 on English summer time.
According to the poll, 5:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer.
The summer heat has increased the sales of British pubs, but reduced the sales of restaurants.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July and in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, which received these statistics, says: “The continued solar activity, as well as England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup, means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when pub sales increased by 2.8 per cent, and restaurants, on the contrary, declined significantly.”
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the food trade in June also continued in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much better results in restaurants.
Pubs selling only food have also suffered from the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
It feels like people just want to pop out for a drink.
The sale of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month and food by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in leisure and hotel business, says: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain critical when it comes to sales in the non-residential market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially since the 4.8 per cent decline in sales on an annual basis will be particularly painful due to continuing price pressures.
A long, hot summer has never been the place for food operators, and it is not yet a fact that August, with more moderate temperatures, will provide much-needed respite.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the phasing-out of brands.
Monitoring of the industry sales of Coffee Peach Tracker in the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses data on the productivity of 47 networks with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is a recognized industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children — some as young as 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta” pages
This news has heightened concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "core" account that parents knew about.
However, one in five children — some as young as 11 years old — creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake “insta” accounts — the Instagram, a photo-sharing site.
This news has heightened concerns about sexual content publications.
Twenty per cent of the students stated that they had a primary, “clean” account, which their parents had access to, but also secret accounts.
A mother who accidentally accessed her 13-year-old daughter's secret account ran into a teenager who called on others to “rape him.”
A study conducted by Digital Advance UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles on social media, with half of them admitting that one of them was usually secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan says, "Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are inaccessible to their parents and teachers, and that is a disturbing fact."
Eileed Doyle will become the voice of athletes in Scottish athletics.
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eileed Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a supervisory member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete in athletics, and President Ian Beatty claims that this is an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from the broad experience of a female athlete at the international level over the past decade.
“Eylid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community, and we are confident that her participation will be of great benefit to athletics in Scotland,” Beattie claims.
Doyle says, "I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really make a good contribution and promote sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and now works as a private commentator on BBC, after having suffered a stroke, lost the ability to walk.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I've lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I was gonna get better, and if so, to what extent.
It was a grueling job, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing skill exercises!
Thank you so much for your support!"
A milk blower ad that compared nursing mothers to cows shared the views of Internet users
The milk-sucking company caused controversy on the Internet, publishing an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to milk cows.
By placing on the market what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast milk blower”, Elvie’s consumer technology company published an advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that the new milk blower provides to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a whole hay cowhouse under a music track that says, "Yes, I feed my own milk, but you won't see my tail" and, "If you haven't noticed, it's not washing, it's my breast."
And then the chorus goes, "Let's get rid of it, let's get rid of it, let's get rid of it, let's get rid of it, let's get rid of it, let's get rid of it."
This commercial, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that it sheds light on the “dreads” of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are taken away from them within days of birth,” one user writes.

Another comment: “It is clear that this is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Another user adds: “Advertising removed from reality”.
Others, on the other hand, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was "just great".
"I think that's a great idea.
If I was feeding the baby, I'd definitely buy one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but that's how it feels.
A brilliant product,” wrote one user.
And another comment: "A cool ad designed for mothers who breastfeed (often do it in their workplaces or toilets) and who actually feel a little bit like cows."
This ad is not to praise or scold our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all danced with these invisible milk pumps hidden under bras.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk blower is completely infeasible, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in a feeding bra, and is invisible, giving women the opportunity to move, hold babies and even go outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood development specialist of Mother’s company, commented: “Elvie is so revolutionary that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
By drawing a parallel between women and milk cows, we wanted to focus attention on breast-feeding and all its problems, while demonstrating in a funny and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that a new milk blower provides.
This isn't the first time that an Elvie milk blower is in the news headlines.
During London's fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage of the designer Martha Jakubowski, using the product as intended.
Hundreds of migrant children moved freely to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, partly because the tight rhetoric and policies adopted by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with guarantors.
Usually, most sponsors themselves are the same undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by taking the child on bail.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guarantors and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be handed over to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested bail for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“Almost 80 per cent of those who are either sponsors or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
We therefore continue to pursue these individuals,” Olbens said.
According to the staff of the shelter, in an effort to expedite the processing of children, officials had introduced new rules that required some of them to be brought to justice within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days later.
In order to declare their legal status to the immigration judge, many of them are present by video link rather than in person.
Those considered to be ineligible will be deported quickly.
According to the shelter workers and information that has appeared in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which could lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Thornillo, where the evidence that a child is experiencing difficulties is more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent camps without giving them time to prepare emotionally for it or to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma many already struggle with.
Syria orders the “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country had been at war for eight years.
Mual, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and “will be dealt with accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally,” he said.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to fight this sacred battle until we rid all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar Al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return and accused “some Western countries” of spreading irrational fears, which had prompted the refugees to remain outside the country.
“We called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he says.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to rebuild until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province inhabited by three million people.
However, Mu'alem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that the fighting would be directed against jihadists, including Al-Qaida-affiliated militants from the Nusr Front, who would be “destroyed”.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the Government and the opposition, will be convened shortly to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem set out the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, stating that the commission's work should be limited to “considering the articles of the current constitution”, and cautioned against interference.
Why Trump wins a second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win his re-election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal do not conclude his presidency prematurely, and that is probably the hope of many liberal viewers.
And this will no doubt be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency in history!"
So far, there's no sign of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled, to 1.05 million per CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primary-time viewers, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed cable rating by collecting 3.5 million viewers in the evening during the main news.
“This is a fire that people are drawn to because it is beyond our understanding,” says Neil Bair, director of the ABC drama, “The Appointed Survivor”, about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by the attack.
Nell Skovell, a long-published comedy writer and author of "Only Funny: Some Disgusting Truths About the Infiltration of Hollywood Boys' Club" suggests another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi to Boston once before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver informed her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He said, “Yes, because he is funny.” Ms. Skovelle says.
In all this chaos, there's something valuable about fun.
Of course, unlike all other content broadcast on television, Washington’s storylines can determine the future of Row v. Wade and answer questions about whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, when you have watched for the sixth consecutive hour as a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of a “deep background” for his book, or about Paul Manafort's $15,000 coat of ostrich skin (a dress snubbed with pride, as he writes “Washington Post”), or about the sharp description of Stormy Daniels, let's just say, Mr. Trump's anatomy, it goes beyond normal awareness.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes.
“His work is often to make us feel like the reality show is feeding you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and creator of Pawn Stars about the changing composition of Trump's show and the daily twists of the story (dracking with N.F.L., praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flace this week, there was 27 degrees of heat on the north bank of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the screen, at least not exactly when they showed Brett Cavanaugh appearing before the Senate's Law Committee and deciding on the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’ says Mr. Flace.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outsider money is invested in the toughest midterm election the White House has ever run.
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives cash flow thanks to the change in the Congressional districts, in which two officials compete for the same seat.
This peri-urban area of Pittsburgh, whose geography has recently been changed, is supported by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives, Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another active official, Republican Keith Rotfus, who now represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which intersects substantially with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that, as a result of election fraud, the old districts had been attributed to Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate on the financing of campaigns between the main party's financial forces, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became famous in Pennsylvania after winning a small difference in the popularly observed special election for Congress in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the county with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give Democrats a small advantage.
The US punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreated.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had provoked a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and was also in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump management team.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to recall the United States leaders of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan”, announced earlier this month the spokesman for Heather Neuert.
However, only El Salvador, which had received some $140 million of American aid in 2017, had been considered for punishment, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for Central America, with high unemployment and murder rates.
Against the backdrop of regular internal meetings, North and Central America had postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which had been held to take stock of a similar meeting held last year, which had been seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior officials had made it clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to move forward and had effectively stopped considering the question of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference was scheduled for mid-October and would be addressed by Vice-President Mike Pence as a sign of the fact that the Administration attached great importance to the meeting.
Three United States diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without bringing any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate, which had been reported by three United States officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss internal issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by an outside analyst who is a member of the administration, but also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next step would be a report by Special Adviser Robert Müller on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump ' s justice, which is now very well documented in public records.
Mr. Müller is also reported to have begun an investigation into the fact that Trump's campaign and its attacks were conspiring with Russia during the last elections.
If Congress succeeds, Mr. Trump will face the responsibility of this body, just as he is preparing to speak again to the electorate, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there is a lot of ifs; I don't mean that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is the fall of its equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, which would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
We did not, however, and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
History is taking its course at such points, and the unrelenting march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are going through some of these critical moments right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Müller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to this newspaper, last year he offered to make secret notes about the President's activities and to argue that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the data from The Times were incorrect.
“How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is confirmed as a supreme judge despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
Above all, will we vote for Congress in the medium term, which will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we can get through them with a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied a Polish house in which I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she walked me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With a family history like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”
Norman Eisen, senior researcher at the Brookings Institute, is the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and author of the book Last Palace: Europe’s Anecdotal Age in the History of Five Lives and One Legendary Home.
Graham Dorrence of Rangers is optimistic about the collision with the Vienna Rapid football club.
The Rangers are hosting Vienna's Rapid on Thursday, knowing that defeating the Austrians, after Spain's impressive victory over Villarreal earlier this month, will enable them to take strong positions in League of Europe Group G.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrance from performing for the first time in the season with a score of 2:2 against Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to achieve great results.
“It was a good moment for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” said a 31-year-old football player.
“We entered the game thinking we could get something and left with someone.
We may have been able to cope after all, but in general, the draw was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success was in the second half, where we were doing better.
This Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be a hard game because they did a good job in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year's definitely been a tough year, considering everything about my injuries and the replacements at the club itself, but there's a good factor in this place right now.
The composition is finely chosen, and the boys really enjoy it; the training has gone to "hurah".
I hope we can move forward, put the past season behind us and succeed.”
Women lose sleep for fear of their pension savings
Although the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the national study said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“People want, care for, and care for, a family member, but don’t try to talk to them about the subject,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationalwide for Life Insurance.
And that's where we start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family for likely having to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your consultant and your family where and how you will receive health care, as this choice can be an important cost factor.
Take advice from your financial adviser, who will help you develop a plan to pay these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care can be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or insure yourself with your own assets, provided you have money.
Get your legal documents in order: Spare yourself the legal battles.
Establish a power of attorney for health care and appoint a trustee who will supervise your medical care and ensure that specialists fulfil your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that consideration be given to the possibility of establishing a financial power of attorney.
A trustee should be selected to assist you in making financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your accounts if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the small things: Imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to provide information on what medication he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on paper so you can prepare yourself properly in case of need.
Martin adds: “It is not only the availability of finance but also the choice of doctors that is important.”
“What medication do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Make and write down this plan.”
In Ilfracombe, a man fired several bursts of air rifle
A man fired a few shots from an air rifle on his way home from the party.
The victim, in the chest, whose stomach and arm were hit by bullets, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 p.m. on English summer time, as “accidental”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to increase.
Because of the breakdown in communications, rescue workers are unable to obtain any information from Donggal, an area north of Pala, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Pala as a result of the disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Palu and Donggal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a district along 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, which is smaller than the province, had 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and, in particular, of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important for the provincial economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the tsunami has caused several destruction in Pala and Donggala over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also occurred in western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred in Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5 magnitude earthquake occurred on one of the Mentawai islands of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidi Jaya County in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake of 2004 and the tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is under arrest on charges of domestic violence.
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, intervening in a situation of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a friend of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su detention and will be released on bail of $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he pleaded “unspeakable innocence”.
Palin faces three minor class A crimes, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offence punishable by up to one day ' s imprisonment and a US$ 2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal charge has been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report on domestic violence and possession of a gun under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups in 2016 after she explained her son's violent behaviour as a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, video footage of the incident appears.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Attorney's Office wants to impose a rare death sentence on a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, a suspected terrorist in New York City, who killed eight people, a rare federal crime that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, aged 30, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle track on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, shooting pedestrians and cyclists down.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to a notification of intent to carry out the death penalty in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty may be imposed on both charges.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read out a 22-point conviction against Saipova, which included eight counts of racketeering murder commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “a carefully planned and deliberate attack”, which Saipov carried out in what is described as “abominable, cruel and criminal”.
“Sifullo Habibullaevich Saipov injured, damaged and lost the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Hernán Ferruc, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagneukko,” states the notification of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the prosecutor in the South District of New York requested the death penalty for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York City was imposed in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed using an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the judicial documents of the Saipov, an Uzbek national showed no remorse after his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was happy that he had done so.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to watch ISIL video on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIL flag be displayed in his hospital ward, as reported by the police.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on Saipov's side, said that they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that a decision to impose the death penalty rather than a life sentence without the possibility of release will only aggravate the pain of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
The Saipov defence had previously requested prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tori MP says that Nigel Farage should not be responsible for Brexit negotiations.
Today, during a protest at Tori conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people's army.”
Former Ukip leader said that politicians should be “feeling up” by the Euroskeptics, as one member of Parliament, Teresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would be out by now if Mr. Farage were Brexit's secretary.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that members of the Tori party who oppose the EU withdrawal join in a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The Premier is struggling to maintain his compromise plan, which was announced in the Czechs in the midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, his opponents, and the EU.
The allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and thus force the Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and the Haos.
Mr. Bone said at a Leave Means Leave rally in Sollihal that he wanted to "play the Checkers".
He suggested that Mr. Faraj should be levelled and held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we'd be out by now,” he said.
Deputy Wellingborough added, "I'll continue to play for Brexit, but we need to beat the Checkers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their mind and wanted to stay is completely untrue”.
Brexit supporter of Tori Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, commenting to journalists, "I say, Prime Minister, just listen to the people."
“Checkers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also unpopular among members of our party and our activists who actually storm the streets and choose us first.
Please put the checkers aside and start listening to what you're being told."
In her harsh address to Ms. May, she added: “Prime ministers remain at work if they keep their promises”.
Mr. Farage said that if politicians were going to betray the 2016 referendum decision, they must be forced to “feel high”.
“It is now a question of trust between us, people, and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you get away with it."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of the betrayal of Brexit, to feel the heat.
“We will mobilize the people's army of that country, which has won us in Brexit, and we will not rest until we are independent, independent and proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit’s opponents marched on Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
Several activists were waving "Tori v Brexit" posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, criticized the conservatives for security problems in their party's mobile app.
“And these people claim that they can customize the IT systems and technologies of Canada Plus Plus, to work at borders, to trade freely without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's one complete farce.
Good Brexit doesn't exist in principle," he says.
Warren's planning to “research” the possibility of participating in the presidential race.
U.S. Member of Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, says that after the November elections, she will “research hard the possibilities of running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Dill, a Republican party member who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There's talk that she has a chance to take over Trump in 2020.
She held another meeting with voters on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke; since Trump took office, it has been her 36th meeting with voters in City Hall.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, which requires a woman upstairs."
As a result of the murder of Sims (stuttered), an LSU player was arrested.
Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder (fire) of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday had been arrested.
At 11:00 p.m., at a press conference, the Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department released a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying the person who was able to make the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
“Waid Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head, which resulted in his death,” the Chief of Police, Murphy J. Paul, told the journalists on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having participated in the incident, carrying a gun and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The young man grew up in Baton Rouge, playing 32 games with 10 launches in the last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world champion title after command tactics have given him victory over Sebastian Fettel.
Since Valteri Bottas qualified on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes command tactics will play a major role in the race.
From the Bottas pole position, he was a good starter and practically hung on Hamilton when he defended his position at the first two corners, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton in the tail of the entire group – a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes went on a pit stop one time later, and then he went behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel struggle, jumped forward, causing the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior space free, risking a double-motion trip to protect himself at the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started at the back of the grid and was seventh in the end of the first lap.
Then he ran most of the race on his home tires in order to finish quickly, moving Kimi Rykkonen to fourth place.
As a result, he left for the 44th lap of the pit stop, but failed to increase the pace of the remaining eight laps, as Rykkonen ranked fourth.
It's been a tough day, because Walttery did a fantastic job this weekend, and he was really generous in sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a few tricks to spare," said Hamilton.
Traitor Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting with voters on Saturday for claiming that she had not made public a letter from Christine Blacey Ford accusing Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the post of supreme judge, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate’s Law Committee, saying that what is happening in the Senate showed that the participants in these events were “scrupulous, disgusting and lying people.”
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what has happened in the last few days in the Senate, is fine, anger, anger, abomination and lies,” he said.
"You see all these leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you "salved" information?
Do you remember her answer... did you “salve” the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it.
Okay, stop.
We didn't "salley," he added with the senator's tone.
In July, a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein, and in early September it was illegally disclosed, but Feinstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I did not leak her information,” Finstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the leak charges did not seem to like the president, who commented on it during the Saturday rally: “Here's what I'll tell you: the body language has really let her down.
She may not have sprinkled, but the body language was the worst I've ever seen.”
While continuing to defend his candidate for the post of Chief Justice, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that the Democrats were using these accusations for their own ends.
“They are definitely trying to regain power in every possible way.
We're seeing scoundrels, abominations, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to step over to gain power and control,” quotes Mediaite, the president's words.
British Elite Hockey League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for "Jiants" in a game against "Dandee"
In the game of the Elite Hockey League, the Dundee Stars paid for the Friday defeat against the Belfast Giants, winning a return match on Saturday with a score of 5-3 in favour of the Dundee.
The "Jiants" won an early two-goal advantage through the blows of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the level of the home team before Dwyer led the Giants.
François Bouchard compared the Dundee account before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals consolidated their victory.
For the people of Adam Keefe, who won the 2–1 victory over the Dundee in Belfast on Friday night, this was the third defeat in the season of the Elite League.
It was the fourth meeting between the parties in the season, when the Giants won three previous matches.
Dwyer's first goal was at 3:35 a.m., after Kendall McFall's golem pass with David Rutherford's support, and Boviller doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the start-up period, Sullivan returned the owners to the game at 13:10 p.m. before Matt Markwardt helped Cooney settle the score at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer made sure that the Jayants intercepted the initiative during the first break when he scored the second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The owners regrouped, and Bouchard made the score again, with a score of 27:37.
Coney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give the Dundee the first opportunity in a match to take the lead at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured the victory by holding the rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Jayants, who have so far lost four of the last five matches, are going to Milton Keynes for the next match, to be held on Friday.
Air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on board the plane could escape the earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously promoted as a hero after he deliberately went to death so that a plane with hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared as a result of the severe tsunami earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Heavy underground shocks continue to destroy the area, and many residents of the city of Palu find themselves under the rubble of buildings.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the horrifying control tower at Mutyar Sis Al Jufri airport, Palu.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, was able to take off safely.
Then, when he thought the tower was collapsing, he jumped off it.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian aeronautical spokesman Johannes Sirait said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a big hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter could land in Pala.
“We very much regret this loss,” he added.
However, the authorities feared that the number of people killed by the earthquake could reach thousands, as, according to the disaster relief agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butong was limited.
“The number of victims is likely to rise, as a large number of people are still under the rubble and many have not been able to escape,” says a representative of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
The waves, which were six metres high, devastated the city of Palu, where a mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says to Sky News: "Emergency comes every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Mini-markets have been looted everywhere.”
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, says to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know they'll be there.
The tragedy has already taken on quite serious proportions, but it can be much worse.”
Indonesia’s President, Joko Widodo, arrived in Pala on Sunday and addressed the country’s armed forces, saying, “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN says.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
The plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports one person missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, on a flight that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person is missing, whereas it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew left safely the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reports that as of Saturday afternoon, she has no information about one male passenger.
The airline stated that it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and the police in trying to locate the person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed passenger information, such as age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and crew after he fell to the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven persons had been taken to hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers had been hospitalized on Saturday and all were stable.
The reasons for the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was unable to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes says the plane started to enter the runway too low.
“That’s very good,” Janes adds.
Janes told me that he and the other passengers managed to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane because the water level was on the belt.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming on board, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing the wharf nearby also helped in rescue by using an inflatable boat that brought people to the shore before the plane submerged about 30 metres (100 feet).
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have been killed in air crashes involving PNG-registered companies over the past two decades, but none of these accidents were related to Air Niugini.
The intelligence analyst was able to prove that a woman had been burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution instituted proceedings against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rawlett testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the department how he used his cell phone records to get an overview of the actions of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rawlett said that he had received information on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to this information, Tellys spent the night with Chambers, which contradicts his earlier testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information received, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when this happened, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that “it is a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellys said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to phone records, they only called for one week.
Rawlett also showed that some time after Chambers Tellys' death, he removed her text messages, phone calls and contact information from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale says.
The defence should begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a "conscious hip hop"?
Trio hip-hoppers are going to fight against negative attitudes to this genre by filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop content has changed, moving away from the original political and social problems.
The band wants to go back to their roots and make "conscious" hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fuguees and Common recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
The New York nanny sued a couple because of a racist text.
The New York nanny sued the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny was “another black” that the woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racists, claiming that the lawsuit was filed with the “object of extortion”.
Linsy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she learned that the new nanny offered by the childcare service, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman when she arrived with her family on her first day of work in 2016.
“NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
However, instead of texting her husband, she sent it twice wrongly to Ms. Maurice.
Realizing that she had failed, the "mixed" Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, claiming in the service that the nanny, who turned out to be African-American, was not doing her job well, and that they were expecting a Filipino rather than an African-American woman, reports New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now sues for a couple and claims $350 a day for dismissal in six months, in accordance with the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, were not formalized by any contract.
“I want them to understand: such things are unacceptable,” she said on Friday, adding, “And I know it is discrimination.”
The spouses disagree with the charge of racism and argue that the dismissal of Maurice can be considered a reasonable step, as they would no longer be able to trust her if they offended her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn't really mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the husband, Joe Plasco, to Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone you were rude to, even if you were rude, not wanting to?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Oh, come on!”
Calling the lawsuit “extortion”, Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“And are you prepared to pursue a man in this position?
Not very nice of you," added a banker specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already handed down its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behaviour and logic problems.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the move with the talking bear, says the new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, said of the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the place of the first reader even before it was published.
It's funny to know that Paddington is a huge success."
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the bear, had worked as a BBC operator and would have been optimistic about the refusal to publish, adding that the 60-year anniversary of the publication of his books had been “and happy and bitter” because the author had been absent last year.
As for Paddington's own bear, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family” and that her father was quietly proud that his character had finally become famous.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” his daughter says.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of it, although he did not really consider it his own merit.
I think that's how he treated Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear itself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“There was a regular phone call and said it was really bad, something went wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa.
“Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes, and that we should say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that the doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually stopped working, leaving her body.
She died sooner than expected.
I should have just sat there and waited, knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to keep myself together.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa, grieved for her daughter's loss, boarded the plane with other passengers, humbled by the great loss she had just suffered.
“No one around knew what had happened,” she says.
“My head fell, I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nadia.
He was so in need of my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who have lost loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey post cards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and telephone numbers that people can apply for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he started depressed, and when he was 18, he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel what I feel every day,” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, tells me that her son was a great cook and had a hell of a smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was like the light was on in the room."
However, before he died, he left work because he was going through a truly terrible time.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler, who killed himself, was found by his brother, who was 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, "I don't stop being afraid of a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis came up with these postcards, "to let people know there's someone you can turn to and tell, even if it's your friend.
You can't just sit there and talk to people."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost Mark, her husband, who had lived with him for 15 years — he was gone shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset, or anything like that,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas, he became particularly ill, not even looking at the children when they opened their gifts.”
She says his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to go through it, this event has shocked our family.
It tore her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Cavanaugh hangs in the balance: the FBI is starting an investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — an investigation limited in time and volume, we could bring some unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was breaking up against a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the reason for their hesitation.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on 6 November, and if — as expected — everything goes wrong for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the person they want and to elect him as the supreme judge of the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators by lobbying for support from Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush since then and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report public?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It was still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh would be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the issue of equality of votes and confirm his candidacy for the post of Chief Justice.
The number of defectors from North Korea decreased with Kim
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined, said the South Korean legislator.
Park Byung Seug, referring to data from the Ministry of the South, stated that compared to 2,706 escapes recorded in 2011, the number fell to 1,127 in the past year.
Mr. Park said that the key factors had been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates imposed by smugglers transporting people.
Pyongyang has no public comment.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean defectors eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China viewed defectors as irregular migrants rather than refugees and often subjected them to forced repatriation.
North-South relations, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the United States of obstructing progress on this issue through sanctions.
“If we do not have the slightest confidence in the US, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no way be able to begin disarmament unilaterally,” Mr. Ri said in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical," and claims he's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the post of supreme judge, “hysterical” and said that he was unfit for the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I cannot help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would be immediately called a hysteric,” Pelosi says about her reaction to Cavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Law Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blacey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment, which allegedly occurred when they were both teenagers.
Cavanaugh performed emotionally, sometimes even screamed and choked to death, talking about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and well-planned assassination of an actor”, organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Cavanaugh merely confirmed by her testimony that she could not serve in the Supreme Court because she was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifys himself from his claims, as well as the way he attacks the Clintons and Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was outraged when asked whether she would try to bring Cavanaugh to justice if his guilt were confirmed and if the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say that if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not suitable not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now,” Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Health Care Act or Row v. Wade, as he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearing, Cavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time to let a hysterical and prejudiced man into the position of supreme judge and to say, ‘How wonderful!’” Pelosi says.
And women have to own it.
It's just anger, months and years of rage, she can't go through without crying.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Miss Steinem told me 45 later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was working somewhere in a senior position, and she told me that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique by which she explained to her interviewer, “You might think that I am crying because I am upset.
I'm really angry."
And then she just kept talking.
I was impressed by this approach.”
Tears are allowed as exits for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in an office dominated by men: one day I cried out of rage, but I was grabbed by a skating old woman, a soulless manager, who I was always terrified of, and dragged to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said to me.
“They don't know you're crying out of anger.
They think you're upset, and they're happy, thinking you've finally been driven."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some minor affair and left the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to prevent her from running for president.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she said to me with a smirk 30 years later.
“The race was already attended by seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and Seven Dwarves.
The campaign was already coming to an end, and she was far behind in fund-raising, so she vowed not to participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 each to men, offered her only 250.
“What am I, a priced commodity to them?” she wondered.
When she spoke, announcing that she would not conduct a formal campaign, she was so enthralled by emotions — thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with a system that made it so difficult to collect money and access voters, and anger over gender-based discrimination that she suffocated.
“You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls how the press reacted.
"You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what are they going to write on my monument?
"She was crying all the time"?
How the Trade War with America Can Be Useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first waves of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, divisions between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year, taxing China’s major exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, when new tariffs affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has responded in an equivalent way each time, recently imposing $60 billion in duties on United States goods, ranging from 5 to 10 per cent.
China has promised that the response against the US will be equal every time, and the second-largest economy of the world is unlikely to face any difficulties in the near future.
To force Washington to retreat is to yield to demands, but publicly to yield to the US would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing is able to play its cards properly, the pressure of the US trade war can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to economic stumps in any of these countries is, in fact, far more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, specializing in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “ready” for the return of refugees
Syria stated that it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and was seeking assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that had lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moualem reported that conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to successes in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live in peace there.
At present, all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country require humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for assistance in rebuilding a devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance on any terms or from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe secures victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2020 Ryder Cup, winning the US team with a final score of 16.5–10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US has lost on European soil six times in a row, and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe regained its crown thanks to the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored the 14.5 points he needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, took his first long-range hit in the water on the 16th hole of steam 3, yielding his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has won all his rounds, becoming the 1st to 4th players who have ever been 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Sleep has been defeated by a 5:4 player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Turbier Olesen of Denmark.
One of the world's best players, Dustin Johnson, gave up 2:1 to Ian Polter of England, who may have been in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, won the tournament in Europe with 25.5 points in his career.
“I usually don't cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup back.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with a score of 2:1 in a single game.
“I feel incredible pride in this victory — I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These numbers are rather odd for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, giving only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend, trying in vain to succeed, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played the top-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we managed to talk a little bit about Europe.
It didn't work.
We take our hats off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played perfectly.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward to succeed.
I love all 12 kids, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to lose.
We've lost."
Red tide: The news has decreased the concentration of micro-organisms in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Commission for Fish and Wildlife shows an overall decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, there are reports of abundant blooms, indicating a decrease in the concentration of micro-organisms.
The red tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinell to southern Lee counties.
The ochagi can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboro County, but their number has declined significantly since last week.
The red tide is also found in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations were reported in and around Pinellas County, from low to high concentrations in the coastal area of Hillsboro District, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasota districts and coastal areas, medium concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations in Li County and low concentrations in Collier County.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, there is still a risk of respiratory irritation.
No such possibility was reported in Northwestern Florida last week.
