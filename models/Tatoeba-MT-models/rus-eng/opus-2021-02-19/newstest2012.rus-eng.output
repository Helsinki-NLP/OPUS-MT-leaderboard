Parliament does not support the amendment giving freedom to Tymoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to repeal an article that condemned the leader of the opposition, Yulia Tymoshenko.
An amendment that would have led to the release of the former Prime Minister in prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was deemed to be a disadvantage.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will hear Tymoshenko's appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the sentence is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the trial was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister had been convicted, had been supported by 147 members of Parliament.
Ratification would require 226 votes.
Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya already has losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert.
It's time to identify the winners.
In general, Islamists win in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself to be a follower of the ordinary law of Sharia that we have heard of.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because the penalty for stealing is cutting off the hand.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society composed of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither unique nor the best, and it is likely that it would not suit the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted the help of non-believers.
Their only excuse is that they believe that the NATO raids were not led by an American general, but by God, whose greatness they celebrated after each strike.
And if we're looking for winners in Libya, the West isn't one of them.
We were involved in the shootings, we served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of profit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce the military occupation of Libya.
The local population therefore need not be concerned about the expulsion of the Crusaders.
Although, without occupation, would oil companies receive Libyan black gold for almost no price?
They probably won't, and the West will finally be proud of the unselfish protection of civil rights.
Unless Sharia's followers put an end to it.
There's a new wave of crisis coming.
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of investors.
A statistical storm struck Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries released GDP data in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, and Germany and France are growing.
And yet the debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are already looking not only at Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria, and other countries.
The statistical offices of the eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany ' s GDP grew by the expected 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, where Germany was doing better than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the initial 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (initial information implied stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth rate of 1.5 per cent.
However, GDP remained stagnant compared to the previous quarter, which, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, confirmed the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth rate of 1.5 per cent; however, it remained stagnant compared with the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the eurozone and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent over the previous quarter, which is consistent with the forecasts of analysts.
Greece's economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
Its 10-year bond yields 28.45 per cent.
Both Italian and Spanish bonds are reaching a critical point.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the Czech 1-year bond yields remain at about 4 per cent.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech team was selected in EURO.
In Montenegro, they won with a score of 1:0 and celebrate an unexpected prize of 200 million.
The national team successfully managed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Chech and the handsome goal of Peter Yirachek, they won with a score of 1:0.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky enough to retain a significant advantage after a home match, and she will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz observed the match and drew up a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the Great Czech; and the heroic Jiraček; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanovic and Vučinić were the worst match ever, after they missed two great opportunities.
The great Peter Chech is one of the reasons why the Czech national team won't miss the European Championship next year, and Czech football will make about 200 million Czech kroner.
From the beginning, the game was very tense.
Both teams had difficulty running the combinations; most of the time the game was at the center of the field.
It also explains the lack of pressure from the masters' team in the first half of the day, where long-range strikes across the defence line were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've built a human shield.
Several hundred university students have built human shields around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In so doing, they wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, the prayers of the students in front of the building were followed by prayers about the deaths of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have built human shields around the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant.
In this way, they have demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that all evidence indicated that Iran had not abandoned its attempts to acquire nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, the prayers of the students at the entrance to the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant were followed by a prayer of the deaths of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysing of Iran ' s nuclear programme, the targets would be, according to the Israeli press, installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is being carried out.
Nutrition of Obese Children: No breakfast and no sausage for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 weigh more than the norm; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to a recent study, children suffering from obesity usually come from unhealthy families.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and behaviour that accompany human beings to their healthy development.
For example, sausage appears almost twice as often on the tables of children suffering from obesity as in families with children of normal weight.
More than 19% of children suffering from obesity ate French potatoes for dinner on the eve of an educational event called Obesity was no accident.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports, but this is true for most families of modern schoolchildren - only 15 per cent of the children said that their parents find time to exercise at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was carried out at the end of last school year, involving almost 900 primary-school students throughout Bohemia.
Obesity was not an accident for the second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company Všeobecná zdravotní pojiávna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils in grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Adequate nutrition and adequate exercise are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children suffering from either overweight or obesity.
"For example, only half of those interviewed said that they eat five meals a day, according to the breakfast-dinner-dinner-dinner scheme, which is one of the prerequisites for proper nutrition," says one of the conclusions of the study.
No lunch or sausage in the evenings.
Experts warn that even relative details, such as the constant time of family breakfast, are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school-age families have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast separately.
The worst discovery is that people don't eat breakfast at all in every tenth family.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The study found that fried food is more commonly used in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly participate in sports, this figure falls by more than half, to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to draw up their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the ideal of healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a large amount of flour, meat, and sweet food.
"A particular concern is the high popularity of sweet cool drinks," says the final part of the study.
As the main luncheon, the pasta defeated the bird with a small margin.
However, children showed little interest in bean, fish and vegetable dishes.
Desiring a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also showed that children were willing to change their eating habits, provided that they were provided with relevant information.
“Many participants in the review team have shown a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when completing a questionnaire after the lecture, Obesity is not an accident”, says the project's outcome.
This was particularly evident, for example, in the case of sweet, cool drinks, with more children preferring just water to them.
In addition, as a main dish, children have more frequented birds and fish, limiting the amount of sweet food and pastries.
The stylist should also be a good psychologist, confirmed by professionals.
In the first article on stylist training, I complained about the amount of information in the introductory classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in the field; advice on the choice of clothing for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how this works in real life.
It's more than that.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks we need.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time with Alenka, director (no man in the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not fully symmetrical.
One has a short neck, another has a boy figure without proper shapes, and another weighs more than normal.
The stylist needs to know how to visually reduce the broad shoulders, extend the neck, or add the missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, who have a bigger breast and thigh and a narrow waist, without wearing them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in waist and thigh size is so large that you can't pick out skirts or trousers, you should have at least one piece sewn on order.
You will certainly not regret the investment, because perfectly seated clothes are priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt, you'll feel much better than the one that's always moving out, rolling in, naked in the waist, etc.
The holders of male figures, on the other hand, may wear clothes with ruffles, applications, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to figure it out.
And yet, I'm afraid that's too much, given the homework we got.
Each participant in the course had to come up with two outfits for some celebrity, one for the day and the other for the evening.
We have to take into account their modern appearance, their dress style and the shape.
I'm gonna wear Miranda Kerr, which you might know on Victoria's Secret commercials.
I'm happy about myself because it's much easier to dress than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who's recently recovered on a ton (please bear in mind that I'm exaggerating), or a very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them online, print and process them using graphical programs.
Mudboard -- that's what the work is called -- then reflects our own style and attitude to graphics.
It's important to keep the graphics of the style in mind.
The stylist not only wears real people, but creates food pages in magazines (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what stylist and designer Mario Camenik told us.
But it was only Sunday.
The stylist needs general knowledge.
The Saturday lecture, full of information about the types of figures, was revived by three visitors, specialists in the field.
Stylist, Honza Pogorny; fashion designer, Yakub Polanca; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a dress coat can be worn normally, over jeans and T-shirts like a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without fastening, like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll up your sleeves or lift your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Toy with him," he said.
In any case, I appreciated the following advice most: "For your work, you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them,' said Jacob.
Here, I finally realized why we were grinding all the definitions and rules, what to combine with, and why, whereas in fashion magazines we often see different things.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist should have more dress options on standby than the number of photos he needs to take.
So for a ten-page fashion view (equivalent to ten outfits), I have to be prepared to create at least 15 images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the item of clothing often looks and works in combination with others in a very different way than in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Hongza Pocorna confirmed that often image and style are half success.
Just look at Madonna, who has no amazing vocals, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often find it unnecessary (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something, and the way they look is a second time).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we have to expect them to give us a different size (less) than they actually wear.
Then we go to Google and see if the tabloids have written anything about some celebrity getting fat/less, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it was not enough for a stylist to know about fashion and to be able to pick out a dress.
Our work is basically about communicating with people we dress; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to condone them, and to hold to their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can't throw away all of her wardrobe, telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things you can praise and advise on what you can wear with them," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what the working bag should contain.
It's a bag you tie around your waist to wear everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky clips or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylists use it when filming certain items, such as bags or hats), special clips to attach tissue to the back if the clothing is too large (paints and similar items are prohibited because they spoil clothes) or a sewing kit.
In order to distract ourselves from the lectures and gain some practical experience, we learned to do the right shoe linings.
Even in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged, not to mention outside.
And here we are on the sticker.
You don't have to touch your shoes with scissors so you don't ruin them.
It takes real skill.
I was pleased that Mario praised my work.
I didn't like the skills mentioned.
It's only part of what we've heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn't easy, no matter what they say.
V Need for Speed: Escape occurs in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambition was somewhat satisfied, but it doesn't matter, because nobody really wanted to do the extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subheading "Escape", there were great hopes.
It was expected to move the previous series of "Need For Speed" in a new direction; the demos showed that the game would take its rightful place in the racing genre.
We were curious to see the parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end, much is different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression is that it's ruined a few unnecessary mistakes that have been in this series for several years.
So, in reality, it's not a mistake, it's an unexplained laziness of the developers.
Adventure starts very well.
You become part of a story whose main hero, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
This idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race follows its own route, and the individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So it doesn't feel like the same thing happens in the game all the time.
Although the graphs are at the same level as in previous parts of the series, it is nice to see some of the tracks.
Yet, the game does not give rise to strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs, or high in the snowy mountains is a pleasure.
In addition, the race occasionally revives an unusual detail.
In the desert, for example, you are caught in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to fall under the avalanche.
The individual races are quite well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while you've been trying to outrun a few rivals (mostly a normal race); then you're trying to improve time (standard race with a stopwatch); or you're competing with one opponent.
Among other things, you run into the police from time to time, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (only three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for a game because it's not boring; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more interesting.
The racing model is following the tracks of the previous models.
This means that it is no longer a special thing, but it is not a shortcoming.
If you're looking for a fake real life, you're going to have to look elsewhere.
Still, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic races, although better options can be found in the market.
So far, so good.
After a while, however, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not as good.
You don't expect complex transformations and collisions from this game, but if you have no idea what your machine will do before you hit an object, something's wrong.
Usually, overtaking or passing cars in a dense stream, you sometimes touch another car slightly, and yet sometimes in a very similar situation, your car starts to spin wildly.
Or she's broken up.
It's not important because of the restart system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
Re-starts are designed so that if you crash or go far off the track, the game brings you back to the point where it stopped.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the start.
It's helpful if something doesn't work, but you can't rely entirely on it.
Sometimes restarts aren't enough, and you have to memorize a particular part of the race.
An important shortcoming of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns have to be done in a certain way, or you just won't fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian vehicles at a certain location in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds early, or a minute later.
It's particularly annoying when you see your opponent travel easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you get there, the machines are already positioned so that you need either to bypass them or to slow down.
It doesn't matter when you're around them; it's all made up that things always happen right in front of you.
There are other advantages to rivals.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of the time, the same rival overtakes you in the same place.
It's especially obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you're driving in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you no matter what.
The thing is, when he's driving in front of you, he's making things worse for you, leading to one or more accidents at this site.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get irritated quickly.
It's a shame, because despite a simple driving pattern, the game is interesting and sometimes so eventful that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what keeps you from being bored-- a concept with 50 unique tracks, a series of races, or something.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You need to keep track of the gas stations on the way, because that's what your car can switch to, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are for straight sections of the highway; and exotic supersports are for technical driving, such as curved mountain lanes.
The main mode of history mode is closely linked to the mode of challenge mode; it is a race on individual plots that you will learn as you go along.
Here you win both medals and points for your personal affairs that are common to the challenges and Story regimes.
Many facilities are available for higher levels of driving, ranging from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the online function of Autolog, which, among other things, compares your performance with that of other players, and provides communication to the public.
This is another weakness that is difficult to understand; it is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into a subway tunnel (let's say so) where you're on the tracks in the dark (let's say so).
Your speedometer shows the figures from 150 to 200 km/h, when suddenly a subway train hits you from behind, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For a few days, our editorials have been discussing whether no one really thought for a second at the time of the game's creation, or whether its creators really think we're such morons.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression from the video series is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although it is unfortunate that at some critical moments the quality of the recording, sometimes quite strongly, is declining.
This is particularly true of incidents involving a large number of participants, where a good recording would not help you very much, either.
Sound's fine; soundtrack's on the amateur.
In order to please the widest possible audience of young people, the soundtrack's songs from different styles have entered; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
The general impression of Ned for Speed: The escape is rather disorderly.
If the game had avoided unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a sense of unfinished business.
Of course, it's a good sport, but prepare yourself for failings to blind you as a searchlight for the airport.

Ambassador to the EU, Witsenova:
The Czechs have a reputation for disloyalty and scepticism towards the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable controversy among individual organizations.”
"I didn't expect there to be such a brutal war."
“It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes in any way, calms down and all players get used to their new roles”, EU Ambassador Milena Wicenova began his lecture in law school harshly.
She has shown how much she adheres to her motto of “Clear and Open about Europe” in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so easily and understandable that many lecturers from the law faculty of CU would be jealous.
Moreover, Wicenova praised the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"At first, critics said that he was just a gray office mouse who couldn't play any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he had done his part."
"He is a man who can listen at the same time to twenty-seven member countries, communicates well with them, and has a clear idea of the direction in which the EU needs to be developed."
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question, “Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?”; that is, as an important step towards harmonization and greater transparency of the Union’s policy towards countries such as China or India.
Nobody's gonna ban our cheeses.
Witzenova focused further on the programme that was key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success last year.
The Czechs were dealing with the looming financial crisis; they overcame the crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at that time was a negative phenomenon that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
At present, Czech representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the Ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing fermentation.
In addition, a new EU seven-year budget must be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and cost-effective, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and which countries would receive less; and all of those issues in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: “A Europe with a plain language”.
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels, people don't try to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone's going to ban our cheese varieties.'
It also intends to make better use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe — Our Future
The Ambassador argues that Czechs are considered to be Euro-skeptics; and also people who point to the negative rather than the positive aspects of things.
She wants more Czech representatives involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are responsible: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and we're joined by a Slovak, the French say to me, "Hey, what's the meeting about, the Visegrad group again?" and he's not happy about it.
In the future, the Vitsenov Union expects mainly new and stringent rules for the budgetary policies of the States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considered the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe to be more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that the countries that wanted to unite, while those that didn't could stay away."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe," is waiting for Witzenov.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all participating countries, not just those of the eurozone.
The brand story:
IBM's innovator is entering the second century of his existence.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses IMB's strategy, the closest is likely to be "long-lasting."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded over a century ago.
The company's long-term viability was laid down by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
He believed in his motto that many of the world's problems could be solved easily if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant unfolded (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her original values, although she was not afraid to change everything around her.
In our first hundred years, this has enabled us to transform technology, business, and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more," says the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Difficult System
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care just as Batya in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniform, and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
Long-term relationships between IBM and consumers are equally advanced.
From the beginning, the company had been brilliantly used by talented people, one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Concurs with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan whereby a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmisano next year.
She has worked for IBM for thirty years; she is now Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
For the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, during which many future innovations emerge.
No wonder there's a lot of ideas -- there's about half a million people working in the company.
Organization with a good reputation
The firm ' s strong position in business is supported by strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM was more of an organization than a technology company," said the Economist, Professor of Harvard Business School and author of the book about IBM, Rosabet Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business problems using technology," adds George Colony from Forrester Research, a consulting company.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or "Blue Giant," as they call it in the United States because of his logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most universal technology company -- hardware and software development; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services -- from servers to nanotechnologies.
She owns the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of her employees won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a bar code and a diskette.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM became the second largest technology company this year (first in Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Forward
Not all of its products came to the customers' taste and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service; and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is driven forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundations on several platforms -- if they don't work, it abandons them.
It is therefore different from, for example, its competitor Microsoft, who is based on and is experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Forward-looking technology
The main income of IBM comes from services, about one fifth in each case from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990, with half the capital, it was the strongest equipment company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion in low-profit assets, while investing $58 billion in advanced technology.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the world was hit for the first time by the current economic crisis.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the Great Depression.
Until IBM seems to have damaged the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM stock prices have risen by a record 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have risen steadily.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything except your own values.
Therefore, even if another crisis strikes, this flexible giant can be expected to deal with the situation.
History of IBM: From cheese knife to space missions.
==History==IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, and its original name, "Compilation, Tabulation, Recording Corporation", was rather complicated.
It was named IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the merger of four companies, whose history began in the 1880s.
They had technology, such as a legendary “task watch”, i.e. a clock that records the time when employees come and go.
The architect of the new company was a businessman, Charles Ranlet Flint, who also headed the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, director of a rival company, to help him run the company.
The leader then cast the founder of IBM into the shadow - Watson's ideas remain the foundation of an unshakeable corporate culture and identity.
Watson was in charge of the company until 1952.
IBM, as is clear from the name, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, ranging from cheese knives and meat cutters to cash machines.
In the first four years of Watson’s leadership, the revenue doubled to $9 million, and the company’s expansion to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that after almost 40 years, his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his place in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, a man's flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined computer standards at the time, called IBM 5150, was introduced into the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the Chinese company Lenovo’s computer production, simultaneously buying the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting office, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high-value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its concept of the Smart Planet.
Its purpose is to make reasonable use of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smart Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
The IBM tradition is strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be located simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also manages a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of central and eastern Europe is located in Prague, where there is also a world-level research group on speech recognition.
Richtarzhova about his unfaithful husband:
Yveta, leave the fool alone, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzhova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Richtarge (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina was still hoping that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has set clear rules for her future.
"Pepa may come home, but not as my partner," explained Richtarzhov.
When Darina Richtarzhova provided the home of Bartoshova in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Iveta to leave Rjičan after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina surrendered, pretending to accept her husband's affair, and now she's finally saying goodbye to him.
Richtarju doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richard and Bartoshova ever break up, his wife won't accept him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one's gonna kick him out."
"However, he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a man with whom I have a connection," said Richtarzhova, adding that she had already freed herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
As long as Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yveta, I'm not going to change that."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union is still in operation; I am responsible for repair, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly normally, only we don't share the bed anymore," said Richtarge to Black magazine.
He claims that if Richtarzhova finds a new love, he won't interfere with her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has a boyfriend with.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yveta and I have full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The Worst Women’s Addictions: Do They Touch You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually list them all at once.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the next line, describing a few female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your other half complains you go shopping all the time?
Do you have to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping at big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their shopping passion somehow.
And yet, which one of you will refuse to go to clothing stores to find perfectly seated clothes and try them on (preferably in different colours) in dressing rooms?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it could be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait for you outside...
Eternal Disaffection
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos. Should I start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Are you familiar with those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you're part of a group of women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It's not that you need to stop looking after yourself, but many men literally get allergic to the partner's constant complaints about their appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more such complaints arise, the more women irritate them.
Most importantly, order and cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Glass washing, vacuum cleaning, floor cleaning, dust cleaning, bath cleaning, at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for stepping on a clean tile in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink; and fingerprints on a window glass in the living room that was so hard to clean?
If you suffer from this “diversion, ” try to realize that it is not good to fall into extremes; and that order and cleanliness should not be the first thing in your family.
A harmless desire for cleanliness may threaten your relationship as well as your entire family.
Desiring to Command
"Throw your underwear into the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet dish towels shall not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Gossip
Some women like to gossip, insult, and intrigue others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk about who, where, who, how and why.
Every once in a while, each of us must be gossiping.
Let's be honest, that seems to be the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossiping women, women who often gossip and despise others, especially in the women ' s work force, who pose a great danger to their surroundings.
Jagra and Physician's success stories helped Philadelphia win.
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful shows by the hockey striker Yaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia win the 5:3 on Caroline's ice, again becoming the most successful Czech player in the game.
In both cases, Claude Giroux used the experience of a thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another show and was declared the best player in the match.
The two successful shows of the match also belonged to a team with Yagorg Yakuba Poracheku.
After the match, Yagre told foreign journalists that he had predicted a great evening for Gira.
"I told him before the match, he'd beat the Het-Trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," explained the Jag, after whose actions Giroux scored the goal at the first opportunity that Flyers gave.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a Czech footprint.
Locking Harrickains Voracek took possession of the puck and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
The second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap with a numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second half, Flyers was driven again.
Especially Giroux.
After his performance, he scored a third goal; his subsequent impact was transformed into a fourth goal, Wayne Simmons.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," said the Jag, commending his center.
"I never thought I'd end my career playing with a hockey player like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," added the Jags.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Rutou and Dwyer's penalty, reducing the break to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger did a great job in our zone."
"He hit the puck, I accelerated, and Reed went to the far end."
"I was aiming at him and glad it worked," described Voracek's impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
The team's protector, Jaroslav Spachek, did not complete the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period because of an injury to the upper body.
Along with an experienced protector, Canadiens lost his two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomas Pleckan couldn't score during one of their attacks.
More than the lost glasses, the home coach was saddened by the number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We only finished the match with one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"For what it's worth, there's nothing we can do about it, we just have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement for replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
"What was our weakness," added the defender P.K. Subban.
After 30 attacks, Czech holchiper Onja Pavelets helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets' heads, which interrupted the five-machine series of defeats, were filled with five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five government travel agencies were able to work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Because travel to the West was severely restricted, travel agencies at that time mostly sold tours to socialist bloc countries.
Thus, Czech tourists travelled on vacation to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, causing considerable restrictions on Czech tourists to travel to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually in socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from that country was needed; otherwise, an individual journey was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered to travel to the West, but it was either to stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or to have "good friends" at the agency.
And that wasn't all.
The currency permit was needed for travel to the West, and it was not given to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; it was impossible to obtain money (Western currency) for travel to the West without a currency permit.
The Czechs most often spent their vacations at home, resulting in large numbers of cottages and summer houses, a habit that continues to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus survived a real revolution.
While before 1989 leave in the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox, which we no longer understand, is that until 1989 we were not free to visit Croatia, which was currently the most popular, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In early 1990, the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring countries in Western Europe was abolished, triggering a huge wave of short trips, mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't get enough travel to the West, so everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in tented parks because their income at the time was insufficient for a hotel or board.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring in their own food (conservatives, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech kroner, and after decades, our tourists are finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income have been rising, leading to another important development around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular charter flights; compared to the past, air travel has become extremely cheap because of the ability to book wholesale discounts.
By the late 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit virtually every developed world other than the United States, which made our travels even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution took place in 2000, with strong demand leading historically to the first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flights from the Czech Republic will take twelve exotic directions.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another important event of this period, which symbolizes our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished the need to obtain a visa for Czech tourists, thus permanently joining the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their leave abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during their leave abroad, including their destination expenses.
The general assembly must choose the president, the threat of the pata returns
For about five months, Czech football did not have a president, and there is a risk that Ivan Gasek's successor, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting in Nimburka on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on the rules to be followed in elections.
Without this, one of the three candidates will not proceed.
Jindrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta, and Tomas Pazlik are eager to lead Czech football.
As he left his post in June, he called on his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, the Hazeka era has once again plunged football into strife between two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became very clear on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the general assembly came to the National House in Prague, Smikhov, for the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote at the general meeting - only legal representatives or also officials to whom credentials had been granted.
This point has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Rights, according to which representation based on the authority granted is not possible.
The debate over electoral rules, however, continues.
The Executive Council has also not been very helpful, although in its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is mainly concerned with this issue.
The way of voting has changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: How do we move to the third round and avoid the Pata?
“The dispute is whether to follow the rules or find another model”, says one of the FAČR Vice-Presidents, Dushan Liberty, who represents professional football at the association office.
Based on the statutory model, the winner of the third round is a candidate who has received strong support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree to a compromise to be considered the winner of the election of the candidate with the largest number of votes in both houses.
The Czech side insists on the condition that, in the overall percentage, the winner must obtain at least two thirds of the votes.
“However, the previous two rounds would have lost their meaning; that would have completely rejected the concept of the two chambers”, Freedom agrees with Moravia's arguments, and he says it would be better not to change the rules and vote according to the existing rules.
A bit unexpectedly, Tomáš Pazlik agrees with his opinion, although it is estimated that Pelta has more electoral rules than other candidates.
"I'd like the election to be held as by-laws as much as possible."
"I want to avoid all sorts of representational folly, as at the previous general meeting," says Victoria Plzen, who is the first candidate; and in his remarks he was basically in conflict with Pelte.
Pelta remains an optimist.
He trusted that the new President would be known in Nimburg; he also hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All emotional fermentation will calm down after today's expected national team's European Championships."
"Football will be on the happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate," says the representative of Jabloneca, who, of the three candidates, has the most experience in the football office at both the professional and regional levels.
Ryhl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This could cause another breakdown of the general meeting."
"I hope common sense wins," said Ryhl.
There's not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, individual talks took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The extra flight, which was to be delivered, among others, to Vice-Presidents Dalibr Kucher and Ryhl to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning because of a technical failure, and they sought an alternative to bring a part of the executive committee to the place where the game was to be played.
After all, the ministerial-level meeting expected on Wednesday could be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Joseph Dobes, would like to see an agreement reached between the opposition parties in the strongest sports association in the country.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; football creditworthiness; and the planned ČSTV general meeting with the new Czech sports director after Sazka's financial problems.
Patzlik joins the presidential struggle because he doesn't see the right candidate.
If, prior to the extraordinary general meeting of football players, Plzen Tomasz Pazlik, the head of football, had seen a strong candidate who met all his requirements for the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not even be running for a high office.
"If there was a good candidate, I'd fight for it and not fight for it myself."
"But no such person has yet been found," said Patzlik ČTK.
Patzlik's motive to fight Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Reichl was to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged election favorite, from entering FAČR.
Moreover, Patzlik stresses that if he wins, he will remain President only until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football life.
"I've talked to a few people I might have mentioned."
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say they don't even want to be involved in Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change that view," he said.
At present, Patzlik's main disagreement with Pelta is related to the latter's relationship with Roman Burbre, president of the regional football association in Plzen, Berbre, a man of mixed reputation who is known backstage as a powerful lobbyist capable of influencing the voices of delegates to the general assembly.
Patzlik thus finds it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football will not move forward."
"With Berbra's support, a capable businessman, it would be even more detrimental to football," said Pazlik.
He hints at the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was recorded during a phone tap in a corruption investigation; Pelta managed to escape a sentence.
"I don't know what the prestige of Pelta's victory would be for football."
"And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pazlik, and now he doesn't mention his earlier statement that he would "sale Plzen's club if Pelta became president."
If Patzlick wins on Thursday, he could imagine cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Ryhl, who was supported by Pazlik before the general assembly in September, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce him to the head of the team."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't know what I don't know, either," said Pazlik, who got a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of a judicial team led by Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Patzlik claims he'll risk running an association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer, he has run the Plzen team, which he helped celebrate its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better."
“To limit the influence of certain groups of persons who are inclined to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, which leads to heinous situations”, said Pazlik, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, with Sparta's director Daniel Krzetinsky.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he will lobby at the highest political level for more money for sports from lottery fees.
"That's one of the key things the new president should be doing."
"If taxes are imposed on gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must state clearly where the money will go," he said.
Patzlik does not consider his association with Plzen to be a burden, although he claims that the president of FAČR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to the Jablonian, and Ryhl's connected to the Prague Ducla.
"It's not perfect."
"And yet I see no point in hypocritically transferring my shares of Plzen's club to someone else if I'm going back there in six months," says Pazlik.
Pelta promised a new FAČR rule that would avoid Chosen Pat.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for a new FAČR rule to avoid future election disputes.
Before the talks on Thursday in Nimburka, Jabloneza's official remains optimistic and believes that attention from the election struggle will greatly detract from today's anticipated success of our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the election at the last minute before the last general meeting, so a two-month delay could have been useful to him to defend his idea of football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“They feel that now is the time for someone to lead the association”, says a man who is mainly affiliated with the Jablonese club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to believe that he's experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the present problems are due to the euphoria that prevailed during Ivan Gasek’s reign.
"Unfortunately, rules that weren't as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If different means of representation had not been accepted, we would have had a president since September," Pelt said.
He viewed the correspondence of a key civil association document as a false target for delegates.
"If I become president, I'll consider it my personal task, and I'm going to take personal responsibility if this attempt turns out to be a failure."
“This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist”, Pelt claims.
Besides, he says he's not trying to single himself out against rivals.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Jindrikh Reich, whom he valued for his legal education; he was well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he didn't attack Thomas Patzlick, who was constantly criticizing Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year and has achieved some success."
"In any case, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by his campaign methods."
"And therefore some of them now doubt his true identity," said Pelt about his rival, and Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations he made in September.
He considers his main weapon to be the knowledge of football, from the lowest level of competition to the national team.
The national team is supposed to represent all football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian case or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"One day after that, I would have focused on negotiating with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football," a forty-six-year-old candidate said ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football head would not result in staff being laid off.
"I'm going to need to know the job descriptions of individual employees." That was his message to Strakhov, where a long period of power-sharing causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general assembly, he trusted that delegates would come to Nimburg on Thursday for good reason.
"If the only controversial issue is how to hold elections in the third round, we can handle it."
"Football needs the trust that he can gain only by finally electing his leader," says Pelt, who two days before the key day of his career as a performer remains an optimist.
Ryhl promises that under his leadership, FAČR will become active.
If, at a meeting on Thursday, Jindrich Reichl, the acting Vice President, becomes president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association are said to be dissatisfied.
Ryhl promises that if he is elected, it will be a time of hard work.
He wants to make changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to solve the problem of Bohemians; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to raise more money for football; and to continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gasek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national team, professional football and youth football events."
"This I don't mean to say I'll do it myself," said Ryhl in his interview for ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to assign authority to the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area."
"I will carefully assign tasks so that in each of these segments football will take great steps forward."
"It probably won't please many people, because it would mean hard work, not just criticism of others' work," he added.
The climate of criticism in the football movement supposedly led him to doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks in my wheels and question my every move," he explained his doubts.
"However, a lot of people have told me that I shouldn't give up, or others will come."
"It's a trust I can't throw away," he said.
In fact, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gasek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to cross it all out."
"There have been trials that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the Association could return to the one before Gasek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something that Mirek Pelt is hardly competent for."
"He's surrounded by people who would do football in a way that would only be available to the chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not for subjectivity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone because then everyone will have a good time, not just the minority chosen," said Ryhl.
Moreover, he refutes the accusations that he will only be president of the Czech Republic.
"While many people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Ryhl.
While the club manager Plzen Tomasz Patzlik joined the presidential struggle, Ryhl dares not assess his chances of winning.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its Vice President, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," said Ryhl. To his success, he refers to saving tens of millions of kroner on unprofitable contracts, negotiating contracts with television, and negotiating a lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was “excepted from the process of returning credit to Czech football”, he considers another rival, Patzlik, to be a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzen this year."
"If he is elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gaschek started, without significant changes in the staffing of the committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his benefit," said Ryhl about his rival.
Europe’s Prettiest Basins
Jump into the water.
Julia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in Budapest: Travelers can test Europe's incredible water - and relax a tired body in a hot tub after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
One thing Iris Meder could not do without during her research trips for the past year and a half: without her bathing suit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the flavored domes, swam to the marble cherubims waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and looked for carefully restored Ar-Nuo swimming pools.
She was in a hurry to add every favorite pool to her notebook, with important details about the building's construction and history.
The historian Meder examined more than 200 swimming pools - and has now captured impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden, where everything went from public swimming pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and “functional concrete buildings” in Townus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited bathing facilities in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but it's different in the water.
The only drawback is that swim fans should tolerate blue tile and chlorine smell, while runners can breathe the savory smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyous chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible," says Meder living in Vienna.
"That's how I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Swinging in the pool and exquisite oils in the sauna is a health factor in the bathing rooms that's so important, because Meder thinks it's stimulating all the feelings.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on this kind of work. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is reflected visually: high ceilings, colorful tiles, and trams.
Illustrated 190-page edition of "Favors of Swimming" contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of the oasis of health - and makes you want to jump into water.
Meder, a water collector, discovered several outstanding copies during a study in Hungary.
It found nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (a cave bath in Miskolts-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a building built in the shape of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jasberen), as well as excellent therapeutic baths such as 100-year-old Secheni baths in Budapest.
From many heated open basins in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is an amazing view. You can see all of Zurich from the roof bath, or you can see the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anthony, and there's a window in the steam room that allows you to see what's happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design is for the swimsuits in Langenfeld, the Aqua Cathedral in Eztal looks like an UFO just landed in the Alps.
In winter, he raises steam from three open shells, which seem to be very small against the background of the Eztal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Meder's pool collector didn't smell chlorine in every pool.
A lot of thermal baths smell like grey, and the Arpad baths in Bekeshchaba smell so strong, you may find it hard to believe you're in a healing source.
The smell causes hydrocarbonates in alkaline water. The water is almost black from the silt, which sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool - a health experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at some point in her search for beautiful bathing places, and when she tried to visit the open basin of the Czechs bathed in Lugačovics, she discovered that the area was sealed.
The kitchens, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked into the sights of the red-and-white-yellow-style building, she saw weeds growing between tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped in hot spots is the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, the thermal water palace in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction. You will find not only neo-Roman elements of the post-construction period of 1844, but also a Mauritanian Alhambra Hall added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace, the favorite swimming pool of Iris Meder, and not just because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"This is a real achievement -- so skillful to combine such different architectural styles," says Meder.
Going into a thermal pool in a palace like this is obviously a secondary activity.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank is investigating agricultural trade.
Christian Tives
Will Deutsche stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann assigned a working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the world's poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
For German citizens, the situation is clear: according to one study, 84 per cent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks are speculation on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of those interviewed require Deutsche Bank and other banks to stop trading in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems faced by the world ' s poorest people.
The findings were drawn from a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of Foodwatch Consumers.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schumann, demonstrates that gambling on world commodity exchanges raises prices - and banks are thus involved in global famine.
The consumer advocacy campaign directly targets the head of Deutsche Bank, Joseph Ackermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley sell the same.
Originally, commodity prices were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that players have abandoned supply and demand rules - and are profiting from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism, promising to investigate the charges and stating that no trade “is worth putting at risk the good reputation of Deutsche Bank”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results are presented to the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may be reduced or completely stopped.
Ackermann's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Thilo Bodé was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "The production of rising food prices is a blatant example of how thoughtless banks are now acting against common interests."
As the bank's chief lobbyist, Akkermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
"The Bank should remove all investments that make money on food prices from the portfolio," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if it's hungry people or Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Akkermann’s quick reaction is surprising at first, but the director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before he left the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not move to the review board as planned.
The elimination of controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also has little to do with the costs - the consequences will have to be dealt with by his successor.
One in two would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bodé published a study on Tuesday for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
No more than 11 per cent believe that investments that bet on food prices are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade, and according to a study, one in two would withdraw deposits that ultimately led to speculation of goods.
Forty-three percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they'd think about closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st Century House in Vienna
The pavilion is in a new place.
Ingeborg Winsowski
The architecture with ups, downs and happy endings: Austria's Pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and was abandoned.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, boldly expressing faith in technological progress.
The Pavilion of Schwanzer won the Grand Prix in architecture in 1958 for its light floating steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built an Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
Eventually, he became famous for the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and her sister, a bowl-shaped building.
The pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss garden near the South Station of Vienna, transformed and opened as the 20th Century Museum in 1962, and is often referred to as the 20th Century House for this reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - there were no walls on which to hang works of art and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition has been deteriorating.
The architect Adolf Krishanitz has now renovated the pavilion, which was called the 21st Century House, and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday night, in all senses, a joyous event.
Agnes Hussain-Arko, who became the new director of the Austrian Belveder Gallery in 2007, facilitated a new venture.
Hussleyin-Arko, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a young figure who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and eventually became the founder and director of the Modernization Museum in Salzburg, convinced politicians and custodians to continue the renovation, attracted public funds and private donations, and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was to include a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Vautruba Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore, along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict Control & Limited Budget
Krishanitz was then the perfect candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, through the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession Josef Olbrich, and won the contest, but he also studied at the University of Technology at Schwanzer, and the pavilion was "a particularly important place" where he attended exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and the tasks that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost part of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems with the last restructuring were much more serious, the building was an energy sink, says Krishanitz.
Window profiles on the glass facades were replaced, safety glass reinforced with glass fibre was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-strength safety glass.
The steel bars of the heat bridge have been reinforced or replaced and asbestos has been removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created space for the new use of the building, a fallen light well between the building and the street providing lighting, a virtually new building, but still a fine Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original outer doors were preserved and the building was painted into an old red-brown colour for corrosion protection.
The theater hall is the same as it used to be.
This is all subject to strict control by the museum office and limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and approved by the museum office," says Krishanitz, pointing to the uneven floor in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light despite limitations, problems and transformation.
Krishanitz recently noticed that the Brussels pavilion was a rough, typical story of "crawling in the city."
This architecture is "always out of place" and still wants to "encourage real awareness."
The 21st century house is in a very right place, because the city's planning has had unexpected luck, and the completely reconstructed "block of the main station" with offices and real estate is growing around the Swiss garden.
The 21st century house could be complemented by the second building of Krishanitz, collector Francesca von Habsburg, which acquired the Berlin temporary exhibition hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city about its location next door in the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multimillion-dollar winter anti-crisis package.
Deutsche Bahn announced a crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in winter.
The number of staff should double.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn's internal crisis plan, Bild reports that investments totalling about 300 million euros are planned for 2015.
Investments are intended to improve the productivity of locomotives and rail networks, even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of in-house and engaged staff involved in clearing snow from tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice prior to work and 90 per cent of the required shooters within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancellations and late trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport last winter, as it lacked reserves at a time of deteriorating weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been awaiting the approval of the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the lines of ICE trains much more often for many years after one of the ICE trains broke its axis at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay a lot of millions of pounds of U.S. fine.
New trouble followed the unrest around Joseph Ackermann, Director General Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is facing a multimillion-pound U.S. fine.
It's like Deutsche Bank didn't have much trouble at home, the past of an industrial giant in the United States has now caught up with him, and Deutsche Bank, with its headquarters in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to calm the post-insolvency dispute during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem has arisen around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds plummeted during the financial crisis and pulled credit unions down.
“We are glad that we have solved this problem without the parties going to court”, said Deutsche Bank's representative in New York.
The bank did not plead guilty in the agreement.
The same is true for Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA president Debbie Matz welcomed the quick reaction of both banks.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is fighting to compensate for losses that result from billions.
It's the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and filed a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs during the summer.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a mortgage pool.
They're backed up by domestic loans.
It decided the fate of a number of financial companies when the US real estate bubble burst in 2007.
The American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long stay in September 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have raised a large number of claims, demanding compensation or punishing fraudsters.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It accuses 18 major international banks of buying about $200 billion worth of collateral from the American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank is also threatened with prosecution by FHFA for numerous agreements totalling $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a bank based in Frankfurt to assume responsibility for “significant losses” but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests $10 billion in IBM.
Buffet's financial guru is actively investing in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the largest American investor, Warren Buffett, has always said that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, as their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed his view of investment in the industry.
According to Buffett, he had to realize much earlier that IBM primarily offered services and bought computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment was considered a knightly act.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, now has the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business network CNBC, Buffet reported that he had purchased IBM shares totalling $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holdings, Berkshire Hathaway, became one of the largest shareholders in IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM had known nothing about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management who had been able to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
"They did a lot of work," Buffett said, referring to management strategy.
For a considerable time, IBM focused on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, also offers software and consultancy services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He claimed he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in engineering.
His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns shares in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with some 80 of its own subsidiaries.
An 81-year-old acquired a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built one of the world's most expensive companies on its basis with skilled investment.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
Making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable money-making instinct gave him the nickname "Omaha Oracle."
The IBM stock price rose by one percent before opening markets after Buffet’s investment was announced.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is also called, is worth over $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
Imminent danger
After the identification of the “cell in Tswickau”, the Turkish media began to question the rule of law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now rising again to the surface.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a reaction to this report in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has given rise to long-forgotten fears; no such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks have taken place since the fires in Melne in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There was never any doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has now been discovered is of such magnitude that it is not yet fully aware.
"Renaissance of the Blood Ideology?" was the headline of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of the secret services and expresses concern that the German authorities may be dragged into a right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, remembering the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral labour agreement at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented positively as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was a slap. The German 50th anniversary gift is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriyet, too, did not miss an opportunity to draw this parallel.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of Ahmet Kulahji's column.
He notes that people who paid taxes and contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany were killed.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful raid were strongly criticized on the German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not previously considered monitoring suspicious persons in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have come to a rather harsh level of rhetoric. “If they continue to act as clumsyly, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves by armed means.”
"It'll be the best self-defense."
“Peace in Germany is very dependent on how the entire network is opened and on the legality of punishment,” says Selen.
The crimes in Melne and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to peace in Germany.
The picture of the burned ruins in Zolingen is deeply reflected in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks who live here so clearly that they are in danger and the Germans that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity among the Turks.
Do not repeat past mistakes
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Kohl refused to visit survivors in Melne.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the Zolingen arson, but his Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel, participated in a memorial ceremony in Cologne in his speech, calculating the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It's like he's determined the value of a man by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has once again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks towards the current German State has deepened since then.
By clearly showing what needs to be done now, in addition to efforts to identify and reassess right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal in Zurich Lake
Most of Europe’s leading risk-taking banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been fighting one or the other ever since.
Now the German must return him to the right course.
Alex Webber probably didn't know he was gonna get that part.
In July, following his spectacular departure as head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin working in an equally impressive position, the chairman of the board of directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was clearly thrilled, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newfound strength, and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS managed to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel."
But it became clear in September that things would be quite different.
The UBS trader in London bypassed the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Executive Director Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS board of directors has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been consulting the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he's going to chair the board in May, not 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Webber.
He's a professor of economics and a specialist at the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he's going to need some time to adapt.
He suddenly became responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved once again that he had long earned the title of "the biggest bank scandal in Europe."
UBS, on the one hand, is very big -- until recently, he managed the world's largest assets -- and on the other hand, he hasn't gotten out of scandals for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank spares nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Up until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The Bank combined the image of a hidden and stable but clever asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become the biggest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, he joined the league of the world's largest banks.
It was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and bank professor who has long taught at the University of Zurich Institute of Banking, explains, "I have always brought UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"Well, knowing what we know now, you can ask me how I could have been so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was going completely wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker, suddenly resigned from his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The bank’s investment unit tried to play on subprime securities and had to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has announced an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to deal with the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors - but investors whose services many bankers would have politely abandoned recently - one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so hidden that its name has not even been disclosed.
It was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce a new billion-dollar loss, and the chairman of the board of directors, Marcel Ospel, the second-most paid chairman of the board of directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, UBS faced a disaster due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, and the government had to save it.
The National Bank purchased toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a mandatory conversion to become the bank's co-owner.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked: the country realized the dramatic consequences of the fact that huge banks had settled in a small country.
After all, the total UBS balance in 2007 was five times that of all Swiss production (see graph).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first one.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the US and stated that he was ready to pass on data from wealthy customers who might have been tax-exempted by the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unjustified business income plus fines.
UBS thus admitted more or less that it was an instrument of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in fighting for wealthy clients, a veil of secrecy.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors then resigned, and
The money of the customers has started to run out.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both its main areas of activity - investment due to bad speculation and asset management as a result of aid and the encouragement of tax evasion.
And it just calmed down, and it seemed like UBS was able to reverse the situation, like the accident with the trader, and the only trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
“The Adopoli incident made it clear that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Banking Institute of Zurich University.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: "UBS's problem is that it doesn't have a risk-control tool."
It was the care that for a long time made Swiss bankers custodians of the world’s largest assets – not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether or not the world collapsed outside the Alpine Republic.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of permanent reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the refined taste in chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich still conforms to the image of a decent Swiss private bank, only a little more.
Its location is classic by itself.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich, Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station to Zurich Lake, surrounded by snow caps of Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxuries, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops like Confiserie Sprüngli you can find jewelry companies like Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to Crede Suisse Palace and elite private banks like Julius Bare.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls, there are large leather couches next to the bank emblem, a big sign for the safe.
UBS knows what his clients want-- reliability.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned the Swiss concepts of banking – or, according to the head of one of the smaller Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper - like all Swiss bankers, he's also working with two major banks.
He believes that the UBS has become too big - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxes are very active.
In his view, the Swiss had nothing to add here.
"And if there's anything, they've long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed UBS, brought it the first large profits - and then failed - and no other financial institution in Europe lost as much money in the jungle of sub-prime assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“On that Wednesday, the governing coalition of a small country with a population of seven million launched the largest rescue operation in the history of the country,” Lucas Hassig writes in her book The UBS Crash.
The politicians approved 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to this?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they'll say the problem is basically the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which at the time of the merger was too large for a small Switzerland, and a bank that continued to grow.
This was helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other; one was a rich, but steppe bank specialized in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin an all-powerful wheel.
Two names are related to the growth of UBS: Peter Wolfley, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Ospel were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wolffley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understood models and statistics, and Ospel, with his inner instincts, who went all the way up, starting with an intern at the bank."
But Ospel finally relied on Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were real," Geiger says.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember well the meetings of board members at which Wolfley always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he was in charge of the "Turn Table" where the banks' successes were made.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make a part of it.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed out a weakness: according to what banking terminology calls “permanent income”, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failures in American mortgage products.
To shut the hole, UBS got into an adventure that almost cost him his life.
In pursuit of growth, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in American sub-prime securities.
This has evolved into a large mechanism that combines securities based on American mortgages and sells them further, continuing to bear risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought until summer 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire," says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the height, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as efforts to clean up the bank proved more difficult than initially seemed.
UBS posts have become a children's chair game and remain unreliable until today.
Anyone who heads this huge bank is facing an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Bank analyst Geiger already has the idea of giving up investment banking, focusing on asset management, and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, (yet) is not ready to go that far.
Nevertheless, it is clear that investment activities need to be significantly curtailed.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Hermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was in fact viewed only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
Since then, he has been able to demonstrate character, and now, as the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday, he is running UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in in the mid-1990s.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan on making money?
Axel Weber must be asking himself these questions.
The only thing he's ever said to the public is that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe drag the US stock exchange down
The impending recession in Europe worsened the mood of American investors early in the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome has had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has dashed hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the bud.
The overall relief following the changes of government in Rome and Athens has not been reinforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still half-full, not half-empty - but now the problems are back to the fore, said Mark Luscini of Janey Mongolia Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on sales lists.
The Dow Jones industrial index closed at 12.078, with a decline of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer fluctuated between 12.027 and 12.170 points during the bidding process.
The larger S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, falling by 1 per cent.
Nasdaq's technology index lost 0.8 percent trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell 1.2 per cent, closing at 5,985 locations.
Industry in 17 euro-zone countries has significantly reduced production and is adjusting to the end of growth.
The Eurostat Statistical Service reported that companies produced 2 per cent less in September than in the previous month.
This message turned American investors into skeptics. "We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe was unlikely to shake off the recession quickly and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these concerns, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was not clear whether Europe was strong enough to do whatever it took to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his view, it was too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-long principle into the waste basket and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM, worth more than $10 billion, raised the value of this oldest company’s shares by almost one percent against the trend during the trade.
The stock closed, almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett stated that he paid an average of $170 per share and now has a share of 5.5 per cent.
The stock price of his investment company, Berkshire Hathway, fell 1.3 percent.
Bank of America stock fell by 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted almost all of China’s remaining building bank’s share into cash, generating $6.6 billion.
The Bank is mainly planning to maintain its capital quota with a net profit from sales in order to meet stricter standards.
Boeing's aircraft manufacturer won, reducing losses on Dow-Jones.
The price of shares rose 1.5 percent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-distance aircraft in a series of 777 with a total cost of $18 billion.
Including an option to buy another 20 planes, the total is actually $26 billion.
Approximately 710 million shares have been replaced by the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares of 719 companies grew, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.
The shares of 630 companies ended up growing, 1913 fell, and 82 remained at the same level at Nasdaq with a turnover of 1.38 billion shares.
Smart crows fill cities
Grachis are considered to be troublesome birds in many places, and experts today say that these very smart birds can no longer be driven out of cities.
Some like birds, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible, crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but people complaining about mud and noise are growing in many localities.
A solution to the problem of birds, however, is far from being achieved.
At the first raven symposium in Lear, East Frizia, experts argued that rooks could no longer be expelled from cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected rooks, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture had increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction, and cutting down traditional nesting trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are guarded.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west in Yever, Dipholce, Achim under Bremen and Lere, there are large colonies with more than 600 parents.
The controversial project of shooting off crows in Lere caused disapproval of the headlines in 2005.
Critics described trapping birds and beating them with sticks as a particular cruelty.
"Normal displacement and agitation do nothing." said architect and landscape designer Werner Clover of Lear.
Rubbering or cutting trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are scattered, and large colonies are divided and spread to other areas."
Intimidation is only possible on an exceptional basis in the vicinity of hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We'll have to live with them, getting rid of them is not an option."
The problem in the cities will not be solved in isolation from the surrounding areas, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
A combination of scaring birds away from protected residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be an exit.
"Info stands instead of chainsaw" was a slogan put forward by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Juergens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be confident to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational raven route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information boards provide information on the lives of highly intelligent rooks.
The project is already attracting the interest of tourists.
Jürgens also gave her opinion on complaints about bird noise. "The noise transmits a lot of information, they have a lot to say to each other."
The mind and the wits of these birds have become legends, often not only use guns to capture a piece but also make the guns themselves.
Behavioural researchers at Cambridge University recently tested the measure of bird intelligence on four graves.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that you had to knock on a plate to get a moth larvae.
Without special training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone needed to hit the plaque.
In another experiment, smart people had to solve a more complex problem.
Researchers put a small bucket of moth in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get prey with their beak.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and hooks to pull the bucket by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four rooks have managed this since the first attempt.
Ronaldo's taking Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of Bosniacs and Turks to win at the last minute did not last long.
Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will compete in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the final positions in the Euro 2012 Championships in Poland and Ukraine.

Cheham was enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of playoffs against Montenegro's outsider after a net win in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss its chance by playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.

Yirachek scores for the Czech Republic.
Then Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding became the focus of attention.
Following the attack on Elder Postigou in the Bosnian punishment court at 36 minutes, Stark decided that the Portuguese player had faked it, and showed him the yellow card.
Stark also sentenced a questionable penance for playing with his hand after Fabiu Quentran-Misimović had fulfilled it.
After a break in 2004, Europe's Vice-Champions fixed the account with four more goals.
Peter Yirachek has dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs at 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships go to the European Championships for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled at Coach Michael Bilek's team and the Bundesliga legions Michael Cadletz (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1st FK Nürnberg) after an early error that could have been catastrophic.
Gatekeeper Peter Chech in minute 9 thanks to an instant reflex, prevented a potential car corner of Tomas Sivok.

Damjanovic, in 40 minutes, struck from the edge of the punishment court and almost scored a goal for Chehu.
After a break, the boom saved a beaten-up Czech world class holquiper after FK Seoul left the field for 50 minutes.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.

Although it is now almost certain that coach Gus Hidedink will now make his seat on the team's bench, which reached third place in 2002, Croats are on the fourth European final round.
The Turks almost made an ideal start in front of 31,000 spectators at Maximimir Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's far blow hit the counter in the seventh minute, and Kazim Kazim's attacker failed to beat the ball in the net.
Croatia has since woken up and increasingly seized control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued in excellent form.
The Bundesliga Legionaires Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukić of the Wolfsburg team, who succeeded Ivan Perišić of Dortmund for 62 minutes.
Trapattoni's on his way to Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first entry to the Euro after Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team - which already looked confident in its place after the 4:0 victory in the first phase - captured the leadership in 32 minutes thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Konstantin Vasiliev of the guest team made the score on the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the start, but only on the 23rd minute, Robbie Keen from L.A. made his first clean head shot.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from taking Ireland forward.
The goal was hit in 32nd minute.
After bypassing the protection of the Holchiper Paul Londak, Ward found himself in the right place, and when he put the ball across the line, he changed the score by 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double its workforce in China in the next few years.
The Dax listing company announced on Thursday that it would invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) before 2015.
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and hire thousands of people," said Bill McDermott, one of the executive directors of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.

"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on information in China."
Massacres are a human dimension.
Peter Englund's strained and very kind new book, Beauty and Grief: The Personal History of World War I, begins with a long list of actors from which the heart freezes.
Here's the advice to read next: carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very closely as Mr. Englund tells you, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon, at times when, like one of these men and women, you'll get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he's written now is unusual, he describes it quite accurately as "work on anti-history."
There are few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, clever journalists, or discussions on tactics and military equipment.
It's not so much a book about what was, he explains, as a book about what it was like, it's about feelings, impressions, experiences and state of mind.
The book "Beauty and Grief" combined the experiences of 20 more or less insignificant men and women in the war years, from both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and nerd scientists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone gets captured, loses an arm or a leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives are glimmering here like church candles: new ones are added to a host of others, and some are extinguished at that time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is an amendment to the notion that the First World War was only a severe trenches war on the Western Front.
Beauty and Grief has been able to provide a panorama of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are hit by bee hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling like smokeless powder.
When a canon is heard, and you're a woman at home with children, will you stay where you are or will you run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on or why we have to fight this war.
“The lack of facts,” Mr. Englund notes, “resurrected by guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors”.
"Beauty and Grief" tracks the fate of people like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young marine of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly taken from memoirs, letters and other materials already published.
The stories about their lives may be scary or exciting, but they are highly alive, thanks to the small moments and fragmentary details collected by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with it.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, everywhere Erzac."
"Replacement, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He keeps talking about erzaz food in Germany.
He describes “dressed rice meat welded in ovine fat (and decorated with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; shoes beaten with wood”.
He notes that there were “837 registered substitutes for meat permitted in sausage production, 511 registered substitutes for coffee”.
Some stories speak of honour and courage.
One American notes the very desire for cruelty and says about war: "You feel that, after all, it's what men were made for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, an evening paper or a bestseller, and to say that this display is civilization, and under your decorated shirt with cufflinks, there's no barbarian hiding."
On the contrary, a British soldier notes that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
“When a person humbles himself to the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think it would happen in front of the public,” he writes.
But it's the other way around, it's like a "sentenced man hanged in secret."
Other comments concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new types of fear.
"Conflict has become an increasingly economic competition," wrote Mr. Englund, "war factories."
He notes the coming of someone called "a new view in the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-sewn suit that organizes the carnage sitting at a written table."
People act unexpectedly: lowly acts are as much heroic as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke about soldiers who tried their best to get sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes to avoid serving on the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhea, which the soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of going to the hospital,” he writes.
"All desperate people rubbed him in the eye, which often led to lifelong blindness."
The prose of Mr. Englund, translated with the Swedish Peter Graves, is flexible, but unscrupulous, well suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war “liberated completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fassel or novels such as "On the Western Front Without Change" by Erich-Marie Remark, rather than exhaustive historical writings.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this non-fabricated pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending I can remember in non-fictional literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he reached out to a page with a list of characters, grabbed it out of your hand and set it on fire with a match.
After the previous mistake, a carefully calculated raid.
Hundreds of police officers, some wearing helmets, were involved in the operation.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because Zucotti Park was supposed to have the least people at that time.
The operation was kept a secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, and the others were told at first that they were going to the exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the story, and his presence emphasized how much importance the Police Department attached to the operation.
There could be no repetition of such episodes of recent weeks as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which was contrary to departmental rules and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation began to release protesters from Zucotti Park.
The authorities were preparing to watch the occupation unfold in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercise took place on the island of Randalls with a view to Zucotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot trainings - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers - with reference to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at "last minute," said a source familiar with the orders, which mentioned the assignment only as "training."
"The few cops I know who have been called to this case haven't been told they're being sent to Zucotti Park," said the man who spoke anonymously.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zucotti Park were in the highest positions in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated in front of hundreds of protesters who had snuck in before the deadline, hearing about the plans.
On Tuesday, members of various police units participated in the operation, including district forces, which were usually used to control criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like work, come and leave the park during the day, making one hour of the night a suitable time for an offensive.
"It was right to do it when the park had the least people," he said.
Rescue cars with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The searchlights and pre-recorded announcements, which come from loudspeakers, seem to have intimidated many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many protesters simply packed their bags and left.
The police reported that the tents had not been touched until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters time to pack their things.
Other police teams, according to eyewitness accounts, gathered around the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, the head of the police department, said it was for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police functioned and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with television cameras on Church Street, along the western boundary of the park, could take pictures.
When the police went west through a pile of personal belongings of protesters, including bags, plastic carpets and plastic bags, full of clothes, the Medical Department team followed her, collecting what had been thrown.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged out, and photos of this soon appeared on the Internet.
A major group of protesters took up positions near the camp kitchen, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the middle of the camp chained themselves together.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Rescue services were called in to cut down the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until around 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clean-up operation was completed approximately 75 minutes later, as reported by the police.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most of them were arrested for “disrupting public order and resisting arrest”, he said.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department, was the most senior officer in the field.
Phil, T. Pulaski, head of the Department's PD, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “did not direct the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to enter.
The barriers were erected on Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw police expand the perimeter from these positions even further away from Zucotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, displacing people even further away.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, released air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood came out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one protestor were hospitalized.
The school staff union will sue the city for dismissals.
The union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students attend.
The trial is probably the last remedy available to the District Council 37 trade union trying to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinator and other employees, who were among the lowest paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of what trade union leaders described as a political response to their refusal to allow the city access to medical funds managed by workers' groups to close a hole in the budget last spring.
The city officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the City Council hearing last month, the school Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the layoffs were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the board members argued, saying that there was no indication in the budget that school support staff would be dismissed.
Representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had filed a complaint, warning the Department of Education that an action had been taken against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to declare a formal suit before the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the City's Department of Education will be named as defendants in the suit, and eight employees who have been temporarily dismissed are listed as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, as are the majority of assistants who lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen the suit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the New York Times' preliminary version of the complaint, the union focused on a number of school layoffs in poor parts of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He states that while there were no lay-offs on Staten Island and few in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school assistants lost their seats in 23 districts in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in 8 and 9 counties in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants working at the free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim states: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to make up for budget failures”.
P.S. 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and she also lost money when the city changed the way it counted additional funding for every poor student who went to school.
The trade union also argues that school principals may have been misled by the language of the notice allowing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The notice used the word “exceedance”, although “exceedance” is more often referred to when a teacher from the school's payroll moves to a list of existing employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were dismissed," says the draft of the lawsuit, "not just translated."
Mission over, Congress ready for Libya agreement.
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the mutiny to succeed, the old dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is to consider a resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (Democracy, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), who commends Libyans for the successful rebellion and American troops for the “stripping”.
“The purpose of this resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country”, Kerry said.
"This is confirmation of the support of both parties for their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House about the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the American army in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing for the limited use of American military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of both parties and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would have cut the funding of the American operation in Libya.
It left the American mission in some sort of legislative purgatory - when Congress is angry enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not so angry as to actually break the ground under her feet.
Then the events surpassed Congress's indecisiveness.
Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels in August and Qadhafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission formally concluded on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee “approves the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary resilience in pursuit of freedom” and commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will the new measures receive the full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or break up the legislature like the June bill?
The latter was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, Republican leader on the Committee.
Luger's spokesman said on Monday that he hadn't seen the latest version of the bill yet.
On the other side of the Capitol, this week, the House of Representatives must vote for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by House Member Bob Goodlatt (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be put to a plenary vote by the Congress of that convocation.
Other legislators have not yet been able to submit their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Goodlatt Amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that address a wide range of issues that have been introduced in this convocation.
Some duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and some more about “the control of federal spending”.
Some of them are identical, but give their authors - mostly newly elected Republicans who wish to decorate their résumés - the opportunity to brag that they have “suggested” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote for a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some Congressmen want to limit the term of office of members of Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives, José Serrano (Democracy, New York), wants to lift the two-term limit for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed numerous amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as has another one prohibiting the burning of a flag.
Some legislators also want to authorize the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states object to them.
As members of Congress had sought to propose amendments, they were moving no faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments, while in the 110th Congress they introduced 66.
This rate has been stagnant since the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment that was adopted, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced into Congress in 1789.
"Battered but not defeated," says Giffords in his first television interview after the assassination attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at a public event in Tucson, member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on a federal channel on Monday night, sang a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Tomorrow" and said she wanted to get better than she wanted to go back to Congress.
After appearing on ABC News' 20/20 with Diane Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty formulating proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her difficult path to recovery from a bullet injury that crushed the skull and pierced the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she returned unexpectedly to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the Bill on Exclusive Debt.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang and called her recovery "hard".
When Sawyer asked how she was, Giffords, 41, said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour special issue of 20/20, which was shown on the eve of the release of Gabby's new book.
The special told me about Giffords' recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In a video of Kelly's first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physical therapists teach her how to do simple things.
Nod your head.
Wipe out your lips.
And then her first word was, "What."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word, "toast," asking for a change in the breakfast menu.
The video shown by ABC shows that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: we see a congressman singing along with the doctors of "Girls just want to have fun" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on the procedure, said she didn't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband told me that he had read Giffords an article in the paper about the shooting on 12 March, when she stopped him for the first time to ask about the six who had been killed at the time.
The suspect, Jerd Lee Lafner, is being held in Missouri prison and is being subjected to compulsory treatment pending trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"It's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
One day during her recovery, he said to Kelly Sawyer, she said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not defeated," said Kelly.
You're just beaten up.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better, and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect.
The event was a Wall Street holiday that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines lined up around him.
The audience in the tuxedo applauded him standing up.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized a spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, also attended by the then Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They've been treated like orphans" by an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has developed between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired, American public.
The troops are squandered with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has its price, says the military.
The public is increasingly acting like it feels sorry for people in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded the forces in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us like we're miserable."
It's a sensitive subject for warlords who don't want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the talk about pity takes place quietly and only between combat veterans.
After two of his sons returned from combat as a Marine, retired Colonel Mark Canchn warned them that men from outside the army would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration, for they raved the rebels and were in exotic places.
Others will wonder whether “under the mask of a cruel, evil veteran,” says Canchon, who fought in Iraq and returned to hold a high government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he says, he felt that some interviewers were careful to ask if he could withstand the strain of responsible work in Washington immediately after the battle.
Canyon recalls how he told his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to expect a negative effect."
The awkwardness of the military comes in part from American indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that has little knowledge of the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism, as was customary in World War II,” says retired Lieutenant General David Barnow, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the military’s suffering.
Troops are assessed by the number of trips they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost, or by the extent of the loss.
The army faces increasing pressure from anti-rape supporters
This week, the historic court hearing must decide whether 28 men and women will be sued against the army for non-confrontational rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and, in her 11th week of pregnancy, allegedly raped by her co-worker at night.
It was in October 2008 that she returned to her barracks at Miramar airfield, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend, and met a male co-worker carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," Lyman says.
But the Texas woman took care of her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, a man came up behind her, fell and raped her, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and another 27 current and former soldiers will wait hard for the judgment of the historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld, will go to court.
The lawsuit alleged that Gates and Rumsfeld were unable to deal with widespread violence in the army, in violation of the soldiers ' constitutional rights.
The action brought in February by lawyer Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., initially included 17 plaintiffs, but increased to 28 women and three men in the following months, who all claimed that they had been raped or threatened with sexual violence by their colleagues and that the army had not properly investigated, prosecuted or brought to justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting top army officials because the problem starts with them.
"Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can eliminate the culture of violence?
Burke also says that since February she has been contacted by some 400 other victims, many of whom may take part in future claims.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak - she'll open up a lot of cases if necessary to keep the pressure up.
The Department of Defense defense team, led by Federal Attorney Neil McBride, has taken steps to end the case.
The judicial documents that Newsweek has received reveal a protection strategy, mainly that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army for damage suffered in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision by Doctrine Ferez, the Federal Government is not liable for damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the inherent risk inherent in the military service of the claimants”, says the documentation.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially banned from fighting, this division exists only in words: contemporary wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
The result: 150 women soldiers were killed between the two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the armies to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are being prepared.
At Yale Law School, a Veterans' Law Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a lawsuit against the army, which focuses on the diagnosis of “personal change” for victims of violence in order to remove them from service, a common feature, according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati of the Human Rights Group, Action by Women Soldiers.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans ' Office in December, accusing him of discriminatory pension applications from people who claimed to have been threatened with sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 attempted rapes were reported according to the Prevention and Combating of Sexual Violence Service of the Ministry of Trafficking.
But, as we know, attacks are often not reported, and the Pentagon's own estimate of this figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examined the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported had reached trial levels, half as low as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case refer to attacks on them as only the first among other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported the rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times to a string of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of rape evidence, and the attacker's blood -- from a cut on her arm -- was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat in front of a judge at a hearing where she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive characterization to the accused, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was about to give birth - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember my commanding officer saying, "It wasn't a trial against him, it was a trial against me."
Lyman was ordered to consult a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her as having changed her personality, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with unfavourable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether Lyman and her fellow plaintiffs move forward is a difficult question, says John Terley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
He notes, however, that “I believe they are in a position to move forward”.
There is a doctrine between them and the verdict that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've spent my whole life criticizing the Ferres Doctrine.
The army has been behind by decades because it lacks the incentives and deterrents that impose responsibilities.
He adds, "The odds are very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will change only when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favour, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform,” she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breivik was just a regular guy who said his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to the Norwegian massacre in July, which claimed the lives of 77 people, appeared at his first public hearing.
Although Braewick could act alone, he was far from alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, interacting with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy, we just have to go to Facebook.
"We realized it was easy to get close to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report on European cyber-populism at the British DEMOS Research Center.
The personal data stock on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the website's promotional tool to single out the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy, which is what marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans all over Europe and then pitched them ads, but instead of showing a new group or a diet product, the ad offered the user a survey that asked about their level of education, attitudes to violence, and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants in 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries - even without leaving the office.
"This is a completely new way to do research," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are less striking: right-wing onlineists are more likely to be male youths who are dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more intelligent, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything in the world, from health issues to social trends expressed in the Lights, posts on the wall and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three entries a day, Facebook’s “super-relevant information” triggers a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the title of the site by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook’s beauty is that it provides an opportunity to study people who cannot be approached on the street with a notebook.
"Once upon a time, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to join the party, and they would never have accepted you," Bartlett says.
"Facebook eliminates all this-- you're talking to them directly."
Others say that the site could identify and investigate problems of social health.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunken performances on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students’ peers, such as their hostels, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drunk status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christis, co-author Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behaviour and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook also continuously extracts different kinds of data about its users.
The website's data processing team processed statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, the voter turnout in mid-2010, and the National Happiness Index (mostly using information only available to them - cyberfreedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what about when Facebook users become part of a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have well-defined standards for offline research, online data are publicly available.
"I don't think many users have even thought about what a researcher can look at their profiles," says Neil Selwin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using the public Facebook pages of students.
"As far as they knew, it was just between them and their friends."
The question then arises of methodology.
There's no guarantee even offline that the subject of the study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much information in the profile and on the user page is true.
"What you're saying on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook are two completely different things," Selvin says.
That is why, despite its years of technological research, Selwin thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace going out into the real world and communicating with real people," he says.
"It is assumed that social research is about social research, and most social research is still offline."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Bering Brawick will be facing a public trial for the first time.
Anders Bering Brawick, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that took the lives of 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter of the “resistance” during the first public appearance in the Oslo court.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and Knights of the Templers of Norway”, he said in front of 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I accept the actions, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torquel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Braverick the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought with him a written speech, to address the victims ' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to detain Breivik for another 12 weeks, denied him access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Bravik in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told Norwegian NRK one of the survivors on Utoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally, it made me feel a little better after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and Braywick's blue tie remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Bravik's strange idea that he was part of a big resistance movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy and said that there was no evidence that he had acted with his accomplices.
Some may be reassured by the fact that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a radical group.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation now feels.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he didn't," said a relative of a victim.
"It'd be a lot easier if it were."
Seven lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the theater this week.
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might think the biggest discovery in a newly discovered interview that was remembered in the run-up to the major markets this week was how much this creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a thorough organizer and a revamper of the production process who believed that many business leaders suffered from "diseases to think that a really great idea is 90 percent of the job... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a great amount of skillful labor."
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley was creating a television series called the Triumph of Nerds about the arrival of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs after a unique long conversation.
By then, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was expelled from Apple, and he was already working at his new computer company, NeXT, in anticipation of a massive expansion of the Internet.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in the Nerds, he says the originals of the interview went missing during transport.
Only after Jobs died was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This filmed material, slightly edited, formed the basis for a 68-minute film, Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which is released on Landmark Theatres this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred for a detailed interview, Jobs here seems unorthodox to present his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different ways, during interviews, there are long intervals between questions and answers - reflections of 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be precise.
There are also moments where Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by Kringley’s questions, forcing him to move faster to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar era, iPods and iPods, the Lost Interview, there is something sinister prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies doing right and wrong and offers their own vision of the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about Jobs' posthumous performance, but there's something fragile and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, an alarming dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things might and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned how to run a business:
"All the time in business, I've been asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you always get are, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to streamline reporting in Apple.
Disturbed by recording costs, often beginning with “standard costs”, which came from the ceiling and then moved through “skilling”, he created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business expenditures to the point of detail.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs details the "blue box" he made with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to hack into the phone company effectively and call for long distances free of charge.
The device has been written a lot before, but Jobs' euphoria here describes the blue box as an act of power giving is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a pay phone, ordering a conversation, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, until as many stations were connected as possible.
"We hit the globe half a dozen times, and you screamed at the pay phone, and it broke into a nearby payphone a minute later," says Jobs with a laugh.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could have made a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple could ever have come out without it.
Jobs continues to describe in detail a famous stunt that he and Wozniak have practically managed by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking for the Pope's phone, trying as hard as they can to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two laughed just before the pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About the love of technology (and the cold name Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, after hunting for spare parts to assemble the frequency, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer job in Hewlett Packard.
"It had a strong influence on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it formed my view of what the company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the very first desktop computer".
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a little monitor with an electronic beam tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and spin around that car and write programs for her.
About impromptu innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of editing boards, a buyer asked him to assemble a computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think about both the assembly and the delivery of the ready-made devices.
Later on in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the fierce spores... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to assemble a mouse that would cost $300], and I was fed up, and I walked out, and I found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About the big companies that lose energy:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs accurately anticipated how many industry leaders would fall into the wrong eye and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company's not getting any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who eventually come to the management of the companies, and the people who make the product are pushed out of the decision-making arena.
The genius product that led to this monopolistic position is being replaced by people who have no idea the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
This is what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times as big, could be a '90s Microsoft...
They were defeated by victory.
About innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea of a great product separates an enormous amount of skill... "when you twist a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises you need to make -- some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts -- connecting them all together...
In the end, it all comes down to taste -- it all comes to trying to express itself in the best that people have ever done, and later, to try to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made MacIntosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had to become the best information technology specialists in the world.
If it wasn't for information technology, they'd be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having dinner with opponents of the health law while the court is considering the case.
On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would be listening to President Obama’s rebuttal of the health law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, honored a lunch sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before a higher court.
This case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions.
One of the issues on the agenda was a motion supported by 26 states challenging the rapid review of health by Congress last year, a law that brought conservative activists from the entire nation together.
The judges have agreed to consider the trial; indeed, a 5-1/2-hour turning-out debate is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be in the midst of a court decision being announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the health law should be repealed is likely Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney General during George W. Bush's presidency.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual luncheon of the Federative Society, a long-standing group constantly advocating conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, a Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the public health law.
Honorary guests at dinner?
Nothing new: two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for many years.
This is not at all against ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they did, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “A judge may attend charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a rapporteur, guest of honour or mentioned in the programme of such an event”.
Nevertheless, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with greater financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethical activists in the government.
“This overwhelming breach of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of General Affairs.
"Judges have been drinking and having dinner at an official fundraiser with lawyers who are now being tried."
Their emergence and assistance in raising money for the event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with groups in cases such as the Federative Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that this is an ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan, not for Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal officer of the Obama administration when the first court-level objections to the law were filed at the level of the first instance court.
Her critics demanded that Kagan drop the case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan hasn't shown that she's going to do it.
Boeing gets a record $18 billion order for planes.
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 wide-blue liners, and may be ordering another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal being over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company gets an order for 50 pieces of its product.
But it's an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft builder, and the price for all 50 planes is $18 billion.
Just as important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a Monday forecast, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced his largest dollar-equivalent business order this weekend, 50 Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 planes, which will raise the total price list to $26 billion, and says Boeing on Dubai Air Show 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts much better fuel savings and passenger conveniences.
The price range for six aircraft would be over $1 billion.
"That's really good for Boeing," said the Morningstar analyst Neil Dior.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft, but also the rising price of fuel, which usually harms airlines because it is one of the largest items of expenditure, is not so devastating because the country earns money at high oil prices.
It's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the plane order when prices rise, said Diora.
"They have natural protection," he said.
Emirates strengthens Boeing's leadership in the wide-fluse airline market and helps prevent Airbus SAS' rival from attempting to encroach on his dominance with his A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory on the air show took place four months after Airbus announced that he would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which competed just with 777-300ER.
He postponed his debut to increase the thrust after buyers demanded an increase in the lift capacity and range of flight.
Boeing Co's shares increased by 1.5 percent to $67.94.
The Mexican president's sister apparently lost in the Michoacán election.
Louise Maria Calderón claims that drug traffickers were assisting the opposition Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderón's sister did not appear to have implemented her application for Governor Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers had helped to push the race for one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP, is the leader of the Western State Governor's race.
“The involvement of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but also for the entire country,” said Louise Maria Calderón in a radio interview the day after the Sunday election.
"They intimidated our candidates, our employees in the election... they grabbed the ballot boxes, placed obstacles... and forced people to vote for the PSI."
IRP ran Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She's preparing to return, and winning Michoacán is an important step in this attempt.
IRP hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have just outrun Calderón, who ran the ratings until election day.
Calderón, a candidate from the National Action Party, or PDP led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DRP, which now owns the Governor's seat, came to a third major defeat for the divided and failed left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morella, denied links to drug traffickers and called on other candidates to accept the results.
Drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine have long dominated Michoacán.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still continuing.
The PND mayor was killed a week before the election, when he campaigned for Louise Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local race for fear.
For the IRP, however horribly the elections in Michoacán look, victory will give the party a driving force.
The man who is supposed to represent the PSI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the run-up to next year."
ADB's convincing Asia to help save the eurozone.
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that will halt growth in the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing large economies must “do what they can” to accelerate the re-establishment of the monetary bloc through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries viewed Europe's difficulties “insensitively” and said that Asian financial assistance, side by side with European leadership and resources, could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
“Therefore anyone who can help Europe emerge from the crisis is useful,” he said in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italian borrowing has grown alarmingly, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The debt crisis unfolding in Europe has raised fears that it could lead the world economy to recession again, and has led to calls by major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian aid would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as buying bonds from the EU financial aid fund, funds to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided great bargaining power to Europe ' s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unstable," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a prerequisite, because where we'll find a job for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others argue that it makes no sense for developing economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Warsaw, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult politically to help Europe for 1.2 billion Indians, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go to the sea for holidays, and it won't be taken well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greek large and well-paid public sector employees at work in poorly organized, wasteful enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Ng said that the eurozone crisis threatened “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
The ADB’s forecast of 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now faced with “punitive risks” due to a threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to draw up “emergency plans” to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
The Pentagon’s Fearful Warnings of Potential Reductions in Defence Costs
Defence Minister Leon Panetta heated the atmosphere in Congress on Monday, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already adjusting to a $450 billion reduction in the coming decade, but now fears that additional cuts of 600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The effect of these cuts will be devastating for the Ministry,” Panetta wrote to Senator John McCain of Arizona and Republican Lindsay Graham of South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to accept a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration would trigger a 23 per cent reduction and the cessation of many new projects.
"This drastic reduction, which has been so recklessly applied, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building -- and will seriously damage other modernization attempts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We will also have to fire many of our civilian staff and, as the reduction will take place so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the civilian staff in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will seriously damage our readiness."
The cuts will eventually affect the troops, said Panetta.
“Although military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the seizure, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious disruption in basic budgets”, Panetta warned.
“Contract personnel will be reduced, which will result in the cancellation of contracts and the oversight agreement that supports the troops.”
“Standard staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted.”
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of the Department of Defense sequester will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand firm against these draconian actions," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday night when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not a way we can live with, and it's not a way we should be imposing."
"Secret is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter or the senator's last warnings will lead to a budget compromise or increase calls for the Pentagon to be exempted from cuts, we'll see later.
Panetta was completely sincere about possible reductions, although he came to work in the Pentagon’s leadership after years of budget reviews in Congress and the White House, and was aware that he was facing a difficult choice.
At last week ' s press conference, the Minister of Defence painted a sad picture of what could happen next -- troops with a shell but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a squad without bullets."
"It's a wing of a plane without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It's a force that suffers from unstable morale, bad readiness, and unable to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he provided further details on how reductions “brown significant operational risks: slow response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be the first to deploy and respond anywhere in the world; and lead to unacceptable risk in future combat operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects might face obstacles, including those that have already been tested, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 fighter jet, a planned new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarine, a new coastal combat ship and a new ground vehicle, which the Army and the Marines need to replace.
Stopping further development and testing of F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and confront potential threats from China and other opponents.
How to Catch a Lie
A quick look at the recent headlines shows how serious and pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is engaged in challenging allegations of sexual harassment from several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania administration was charged with perjury because they allegedly concealed that the retired football coach had raped the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar when the microphone went on.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
Congressman New York City and Internet ex-fictionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself, denying his pranks, which was quickly refuted by undisputed evidence.
A former presidential candidate, John Edwards, was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to harbour extramarital ties.
And again, no one living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was found lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term.
Stories of high school and college fraud are commonplace.
There have been cases in which teachers have given students answers to their tests in order to have a good assessment of their performance.
Mentors who have to teach the opposite are sending a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In one day, studies show that you can be lied 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to save.
Another study revealed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Lying or lying is a skill that everyone needs for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game, like, say, charades, where you have to say, "Got!", lying is a serious line of knowledge based on scientific data gathered over the past six decades at prestigious universities that are engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most old myths about lies have been dispelled.
Liars look in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stutter, blush, or fuss.
There is no reason to conclude that liars are hard to spot and difficult to expose.
An experienced liar can get to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the makeup, the structure of the questions, and the temporal characteristics.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of knowledge about lies, and it is clear that lying is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel relaxed, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling the way others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie about others, usually to protect someone ' s feelings, that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried ones (but the lies they say are most often brazen).
We also know that if you are perceived as a cheater, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do you know if anyone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your target.
It's called "the initial state determination."
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing changes further.
Watch the pose, the laughter, the voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person knocks with his feet at all times in a normal state, then you will not be making unfair accusations when you see a kick in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of deceiving verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Liars can pick up the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet towards the door, lean towards the exit, change their pose in a certain way, or show "facilitation after the interview" -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and pose change when all the difficult questions are behind us.
Investigators often falsify the end of the interrogation to just see this relief after the interview.
So, look at your subject's speech.
Scott Peterson is known to have erred and used his past time, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, leading to her search throughout the country.
Conceiving people can also use distance in the speech, "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinsky" or repeat the complex question entirely.
The most typical note indicators are barely detectable.
Someone can use a "qualification language" when they answer the difficult question, "Okay... to tell the truth... as far as I know... as far as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There's no magic tool to detect a lie, but you can master the skill to detect deception.
These skills will increase everyone's chances of not falling victim to skilled cheats in their professional and personal lives.
The disputed pipeline plan needs to be reviewed after the US threat to delay its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- causing the anger of trade unions, but calming the environmentalists -- the company planning to build the pipeline claims that it will willingly reconsider the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of Sand Hills in Nebraska and was confident that the project would still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval for the pipeline, albeit on another route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it will postpone the project at the federal level until it examines new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills and Ogalala Aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental assessment commissioned by the Department of State is likely to postpone the decision until 2013, after the elections the following year, although the authorities denied that the decision involved politics.
Obama, in a written statement last week, called the decision an appeal by the Department of State, and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline should extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He's supposed to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to oil refineries in Texas.
To do that, he needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but he is loved by trade unions, which hope for some 20,000 jobs connected to the pipeline.
But Nebraska’s anti-plan legislators are considering a bill to expedite movement from Sand Hills and Ogallala’s aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
A current study by the Department of State on the impact on the environment had shown that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source in the energy industry had stated that the Department ' s auditor had commissioned a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle was sued for allegedly nauseating her child in fear.
A family in New York claims that Patti LaBelle's disco-divorce began to rage in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scaring their young daughter to the point that she vomited out of fear.
Lady Marmalade's tyrad scared Genevieve Monk, an 18-month-old woman, so much that she suffered " personality change, sleep disorder" and "strong fear of strangers," says her family in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on November 10 last year when Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten teacher, Roseanne, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching a car, Roseanne Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanne Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down for a minute.
"Someone came up behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle was angry enough to reprimand a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door," said Roseanne Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started using curses -- the word on C and the word on F -- on heightened tone...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escorts had to hold her back and push her into the waiting car, said Roseanne Monk.
The baby cried so hard, she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle an apology note, but no response was received.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives are not answering their calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not reported, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken up the case for free and that the family planned to donate any money that would be received to charity for children with cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty LaBelle answer for what he did," Davis said.
"This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially in relation to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate problems slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López’s rule in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market increased, foreign funding declined and the economy weakened.
The year 2011, which will be included in the economic history of Sinaloa, as linked to the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés, also known as the year of change, which has given rise to great hopes for the development of the economy, but given the adverse climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but there has been a decline in the basic indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures not only resulted in millions of losses for the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth potential of the public economy, resulting in a 3.6 per cent overall decline in economic activity in the first half of the year, largely due to a historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on the areas affected by the cold provided by the Council for Sustainable Rural Development of Mexico, 835.582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were completely affected and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected, the main damaged crops being vegetables, maize and powder.
Until November, the decline in economic activity led to a steady rise in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters of the year, an accelerated increase in unemployment rates was recorded, between January and March, 55.053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, while in the second quarter the proportion rose to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September it continued to rise to 6.19%, the proportion of people who numbered more than 74,000 unemployed Sinaloa, an increase of 18.969 compared to the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year has many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions taken in public policy.
“What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which involves several factors, including a loss of liquidity in the market to limit the resources imposed by the law that was passed in Congress to combat money-laundering, because people who illegally own dollars have difficulty working with them, investing and using them in something,” he said.
Stopped immigration
Lopez Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the rise in unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state to seek employment abroad has been limited in the US, primarily because of entry difficulties, and the second because once they enter, they already face a lot of difficulties in finding work, so a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, as a result of which unemployment is rising”, he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is getting worse if you look at the large number of violations that prevail in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the State is working without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregular formalities, another reminder of employment in the State is given by low wages; in the State, the lowest wages in the country are recorded by the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5.352 pesos until September, well below the national average of 7.375 pesos.
Reducing FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and high unemployment rates, 2011 saw the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, between January and July, state FDI amounted to $630,697. This represents a decline of 87.74 per cent, compared with $5,143.312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government recorded only 17.280,000 pesos of investment during the year, mainly from service companies.
Debt
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, in July, the state government requested the approval of a 3 billion pesos loan during the state congress, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and until November no debt advantage was expected in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government's Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization among the various sectors, including the state government itself.
“The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really low, has to work hard to recover the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have not been able to agree on the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowdown
Lopez Loredo said that events such as the early freezes this year stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“The low size of the economy is the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was the slow economy, which is not fast enough to create economic dynamics that allow for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services, and therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations”, he said.
Revision of the direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic production activity.
“In general, we found that we were working on it, we believe that there is a need to develop a long-term programme that redefines the direction and economic direction of the state, and we need to mobilize all the material and human resources Sinaloa has,” he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better guide the Government's efforts.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there has been little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,” he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policy.
“There are facts that allow us to say that the government is beginning to get involved, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government realizes that much more needs to be done,” he said.
He's being sentenced for eight kilos of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days ' income - this sentence was imposed on a Navolato citizen for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney-General ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who had been convicted of a crime against health, was in this case possession of marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
According to case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 while patrolling Cypruso Valdés Street, in front of post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck carrying a black bag in a box in a car and a small backpack in a passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continues to be detained at the Centre for Support of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
We need to make contributions to the work.
Public works related to programmes such as the Motherland, Saving Public Space and 3x1 for migrants risk being left unfinished or long delayed due to lack of funds, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes had been developed so far, they were in danger because the State Government was unable to make contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State was expected to contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided the resources to work, so there was still a possibility of delay in their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny when they should have given us a piece," he said, "so we don't put it off, we've started work and they've come a long way, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions he had to make, so that at the beginning of the term, the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that had not been provided in the case of the State administration.
"It happened to us in the previous administration because the state had no financial opportunity to participate, and the programs continued to evolve, and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we need to find the resources to cover what the state owes," he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that interest pertaining to them would be reached as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court will confirm the “digital television transition” in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice (SC) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which transfers the so-called “digital television transition” from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes required to cancel it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his mandate by issuing a decree detailing the actions to move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, constitutional claims filed by the Senate were dismissed because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right established by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to challenge the decree and support the complaints, and Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned therein concerning the introduction of digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the draft in the sense that the federal executive branch could not determine the general rules for the measures to be prepared by the public administration.
“I also do not believe that if this were to happen, it would affect the regulatory authority's autonomy”, and recalled that planning public policy in strategic areas such as telecommunications has to do with the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the administration of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital ones - one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years - has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of conversion into a digital form, which includes meeting public needs, which have not only a technical dimension, “because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These questions, he said, “requires the work of the entire system of State economic administration, which includes a group of authorities which the Constitution unites in the executive branch of the State”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and had done so with the help of the executive, despite the existence of highly specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures administrative compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
Michoacán is analyzing the possibility of counting voice by voice.
According to the EDP, the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor ' s elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 out of the total of 6.074 minutes.
The possibility of counting “voting by vote” is real with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where, according to the Provisional Electoral Results Programme (PRRP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the 879 votes in the total of 6.074 minutes.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (MIE), Maria de Los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electorate had adopted a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the State Constitution or Electoral Code or the Electoral Law, as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal date for their entry into force in the electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the time limits set by the law in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJJ) decided on a constitutional claim filed by the local legislature and called the state's constitutional reform representative's “invalid and illegal” voice, as it had no right to “authorize or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of a “vote for vote”, Maria de los Angeles Llanderal argued that, with the adoption of suitable principles, it would be possible for the IMS General Council to submit a partial or complete vote count to the local electoral body.
Thus, a partial recalculation of one or more ballot boxes may be made under the conditions that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the ballot box or is not available to the President; or there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, there may be a general recount of votes in all ballot boxes when there is an indication that the difference between the expected winner of the election under consideration and the second ballot is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request at the beginning of the session from a representative of the party and/or coalition that has nominated the second candidate.
A general recount will also be made if, at the end of the normal count, it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to 1 per cent, provided that there is a petition from the political party whose candidate is second, in the event that the ballot boxes that were counted in part are excluded.
It is worth noting that this is the case for the elections in Morelia, where, according to EDP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16%, even excluding 129 votes out of a total of 923 protocol.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, confirmed by his family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday evening; on Monday, an examination and a calm mass were conducted.
According to the family, the Lieutenant Colonel’s last will was to be scattered in the Sapalanama Mountains.
After receiving condolences, together with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the Lieutenant Colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he was examined by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and a football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during secondary school.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo, and his ashes were scattered in the Sapalinama Mountains, and he always said that to his family and friends," that's what Sandra Cortés Basio, the pilot's sister, told him.
In her opinion, the Lieutenant Colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she thought he was at the height of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother loyal to his family."
Felipe Cortés Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to attend the Aviation College in Zapopana, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he was dizzy even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to greet him as when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to celebrate his relative’s diplomas, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in his life — flying a plane.
He's being escorted on the last road.
Gunshots were fired in honour of Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortés Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo Technical High School, where he attended in 1985 and made progress in both his studies and sports, and guided him on his last journey.
Basio Cortés recently died when the helicopter he was running crashed, along with the Provincial Secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the remains of Basio Cortés, a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major James Martinez, to the esplanade of the training school where his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers, had already been waiting for him.
Three bodies found abandoned on the NL Kadereita farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed the media 11 people who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in Kaderaita Jiménez municipality, Nuevo León.
The discovery was found at a distance of 1.5 kilometres from the Cadereita highway towards Santiago, on a hill in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by noticed that the gates were opened in a village house, the wall of which was painted beige and brown.
When they looked inside, just three metres away, they found the bodies of three persons, and immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and there was another man in a white shirt next to him.
In almost one metre was the body of another person, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them were facing down.
According to evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no shell casings.
There are signs on the fence of a village house addressed to one organized criminal group by another, and there are several bullet holes in it and in the gate.
11 caught in Caderite
The Ministry of National Security has submitted 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kaderaita and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, “fraud” and secret graves.
According to published information, initially on 11 November, eight people were detained in the Los Alvero colony and one hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event took place on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., with military personnel patrolling the village of Old Rancho in Caderite when they saw a car with two men in the salon without license plates.
After stopping them and inspecting them, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after these statements, on 13 November, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Prada, who, after seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Kaderaita.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present a new Government that will face a crisis that has brought this country to the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and has damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
He was expected to present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it was not clear when the new executive would take up its position.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with the political parties in his attempt to form a Government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period,” the former European Commissioner said to reporters.
Monty did not make it clear that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well-defined," he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less the usual, as Italy was struggling with the political and financial crisis that put their debt at a critical level.
The administration, under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monty, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders in order to restore confidence in Italy.
Based on pressure on Monty to hurry, unstable markets set Italy’s BTP bonds at over 7 percent by 10 years, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after a meeting with Monty, "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this Government is Italy's last chance to emerge from this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said reporters Angelino Alphano, secretary of the centralist right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the government majority of technocrats that form Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty Government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased pressure to warn that Monty’s failure could be a disaster.
Monty began consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll end up meeting on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, which allowed for an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would retire, Italy’s debt is now at a critical level, with uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister will succeed.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the eurozone’s modern financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would exist until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread projections that politicians would only give him time to reform before he appointed a new election.
Monty said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should only be made up of technical specialists, indicating their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties made it difficult to include political figures.
Spaniards have more gambling experience than Ticos.
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international matches.
On Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 games.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 players called by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While world and European champions, number one in FIFA's monthly rankings, have a full list of class A selection games, Tricolor has only a defender, Michael Umana, as the only one who has played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
Spanish football players playing in the League of All Stars and in the strong clubs of the Premier League of England were very active in the league and in the local championships during this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
To this is added the experience of Spanish fury in the complex skills of the Euro or the World Cup.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he is the head of the Spanish team, Iker Kasillas, who last Sunday against England (the mother lost 0-1 in London) repeated Andoni Subibarreta's ex-holli record, with 126 international matches.
Casillas is going to play against Tricolour today and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, a Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Javi were declared the best last week by UEFA, along with another player from the Iberian team, Subibarreta, with 126 matches and bombardier Shalke Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Almost approaching the hundred and ninety-seven Charles Pujol.
Javi Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Inesta with 62, Sesk Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From Costa Rica next to Michael Umana, left side junior Diaz with 48 matches and bombarder Brian Ruiz with 45.
Then, only five of them crossed the line in 30 games: Calor Navas with 31, Randall Asopheifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36, and José Luis López with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain were played by Gérard Pique (37), Sergio Busquettes (36), Santiago Santi Kasorla (32), Alvaro Arbelloa (31) and Raúl Albiola (31).
With less than 30 exits on the field, there are Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25, and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Hordy Alba only has two games, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar only has one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet made their debut.
Spanish lead player David Villa with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who scored twice as many points as Carlos Hernandez and three times more than Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet included the country on a 20-year tour.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true."
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the band was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There were more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says it's also a dream that's come true for them to play in this country.
It was a statement by a bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is in South America on a 20th anniversary tour and will make its only stop in Central America on Sunday, the 20th.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., with the Los Angeles team The X and the local band Las Robertas.
It's an extract from a conversation that's fully deciphered online in The Nation.
For your fans in Costa Rica, is it a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is just our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything's going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once-- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're very happy to bring our music there.
I'm asking that because there's some loyalty to the band; fans live tense the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most devoted fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, while waiting for your concert, treat him like the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in San Paulo, and we're hoping it's got us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfing friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and in Mexico, they're great surfing places, that's how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say you've made a big show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for the performance in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to make the best show possible with a variety of songs; we'll try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us, and so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
You're celebrating 20 years of your career on this tour.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine that we'd be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for more than 20 years makes it like a dream.
We rejoice at our luck, and we are very encouraged that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things are working out very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the grunge bloom?
It has always been an honour to be part of this group of great collectives.
We're good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, one group from the same city appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle band.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and we're honored to be part of Seattle's sound.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same composition for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, music roads have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't have been better.
Your attitude toward the word of glory was not easy; but your success enabled you to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to strike a balance.
We take care not to be on the tour too long, because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what made it, not deciding to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs and in the beginning it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years, and we haven't released a single album, until Andy Woods's death.
There were a lot of disappointments because it's been so long, and most importantly, that we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferweser) and Greg (Gilmore), who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or a picture, I think about the incredible person Andy was, and how he made me laugh, it's always been a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and a lot of other things.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas will be responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yeah, the producers sent us some video proposals, and it was a group that we liked the most, so we can't wait to see what Las Robertas can offer in person, and it's got to be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
That's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's using the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind are Gizer Butler, John Entwhistle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunge relevant even though he's no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling a little bit different from the word grunge.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone who appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music now better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs in the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very grim, although they may sound a little positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, those songs were very dark.
I think that when you grow up and there's been some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
Ex-President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at a public hospital, and his family doctor informed him about the loss of muscle force in his legs.
Fujimori, 72 years of age, who has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which has led to his surgery four times and is being monitored.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told television channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that, in his view, Fujimori should be a candidate for the benefit of a pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He's had four operations on the cancer of his tongue, and he's lost 18 kilos in weight, plus other diseases, such as severe erosive gastroitis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and blood circulation problems in his legs, listed by the doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Special Operations Police Department.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the army destruction squad, which operated in secret during the early years of his rule.
Mojica is going to Mexico to strengthen political ties.
An official delegation led by the President of Uruguay, José Muhika, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will come to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political problems of the region.
The Muhika will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderón, the most important item in the extensive plan to meet with the political, commercial and community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, in accordance with the timetable published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalajara will be “favourable for the exchange of information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking Calderón's support for Uruguay in an incident with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy listed a South American country as a tax haven at a meeting of the G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remained tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's protest and the withdrawal for consultations of his Ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group formed from the most developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, had with the South American country since January this year an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to expedite the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to withdraw from the grey list of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, drawn from countries that do not use international standards for tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay had been in force since 2004 with the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which had increased trade between the two countries.
The mustache plumber will be 3D with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's evil paws, but he's never done it in three dimensions before: at Super Mario 3D Land, he's gonna fight for a girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in shops around the world this month, is based on the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows three dimensions to be played without the use of glasses.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell you how the stereos are going to work without glasses," said the chief of the press office of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, when he presented the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game specially designed for this platform," because until now successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have adapted existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that, despite the existence of the 3D, Super Mario 3D Land was a "accessible" video game that allowed for the enjoyment of a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
One day, most experts will go "second round" to levels of the game, which this time are more complex.
In addition, users may choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that affects only the depth of the action, but which needs to be played in three dimensions in order to overcome a variety of obstacles and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This invasion of Super Mario into three dimensions also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the series and repeats a successful formula from previous games, a plumber with a mustache needs to go through dangerously mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes, and enemies, as well as "player" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo had begun so that he would answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the process by which Guatemala responded to a request from a northern country that requested Portillo to be extradited to try him there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision was linked to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that, during his mandate, he had not “handled” legal decisions and had taken all extradition procedures of which he had ever been aware.
Together with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marroquín, he will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the former Head of State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court, Portillo will be extradited once, with a ruling on his legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove's social support organization are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social exclusion helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs have been created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for a ceremony held at the premises of the old Fabra I Coates factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove was born near the Trinity Velya in 1986 to help young people with lack of education, joblessness and drug problems or who are marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration at Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that collaborated with the association during these 25 years.
The different political perceptions during the elections demonstrated the unique nature of Trinijove's work.
Following the President of Generality, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Hordi Pujol, the ex-consul of the Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and the ex-Lieutenant of the Mayor and the current eco-socialist, member of the Municipal Council, Ricardo Goma, attended the ceremony.
He also appeared at Fabra I Coats as a current social welfare and family consultant, Josep Lewis Cleris and SEA social work director La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far was “a good base”.
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and hope in people in difficulty.
"Crisis is not new to the organization and the work done to her," he said.
Captured building, where mass parties were organized, evacuated
Capturers occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without a struggle.
It seems that the nightmare of the neighbors living in 51 Balmes Street is over.
Twelve people left the building yesterday at noon voluntarily, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that irritated neighbours, by court order without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, there'll be a security pass," said the manager.
The squatters who took 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest were occupied, took all the electricity and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially liquor cans.
The first three floors were a venue for mass parties that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Right outside the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her income had fallen by 80 per cent since the building was occupied.
The club owner says the invaders dragged her into an unfair competition because they sold drinks for three euros, whereas at the club for ten.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to the neighbors' complaints about noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by club visitors, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, by those who attended the parties that organized them, whose frequency and intensity increased, as the angry neighbours said.
The owner of the club said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now he's been forgiving her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The chairman of the municipal group PP, Counsellor Alberto Fernand Díaz, demanded last week “to evacuate the building immediately to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit among the neighbours and the degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that, until summer, only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months, the squatters had invaded all floors and almost every room, and that some of them had been broken into.
In this sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to resist the culture of the building”.
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building to Know Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police left for Montral Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the possibility of a competition after contests about contributions
The 16-door municipal contest resumed debate on the role of Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CBC), the administration printed promotions for Colserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a large park in Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures with New York Central Park.
With the death of the U.S.C.C., in 1987 the park regained its place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that is not oriented to the north-south, but to the top of the sea.
The position of Colserola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with the wild boar as Yoga bear.
That was so until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Colserola.
The gate means the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is, Colserola? Park or mountain?
The competition, and its organizational side, and its impact on the city, are the subject of discussion for all the architects of Barcelona.
It's almost the most recurring topic being discussed when two members of this select people clan recognize each other in the elevator.
And that leads to one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present say.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: The competition is appropriate
For Roldan, once the shoreline has been reached, it becomes “necessary” to discuss the “front of the mountain” when the proposal of Ildefon Heart, a mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
"We must assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because of its excellent accessibility.
Colserola is more complicated,” says an architect for whom the title of the Colserola Gate contains a "word trap": we should not think of them "as entering the park, but as limiting certain areas where we must act."
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona with city-building experience, called the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."
Risks arising from the “uncertainness of public space forecasting” following the experience of the 1980s, which ended at the Forum site with its “swan song”.
The first fear is the actual limitation of the boundaries where you can build.
"Restriction of something is the preparation of the next step," I mean, transition.
"We have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current (as far as the General Capital Plan (GSP) is concerned) could lead to a real disaster."
Closer to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic matter.
Modolo recalls that there is already a work done outside Calcerola, which "should not be overlooked," although he is grateful for the opportunity offered by the City Hall to join the project "from the beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter into a debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is what should lead multidisciplinary teams (“success,” he claims), which should have created: “The architects should only be an instrument”.
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that the name of this part asks is complex, because the rules of the competition lack a general view of Colserola: "There were 16 competing competitions," he says, "in the sense of the sea-mount, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
That makes at least in his case, decide to compete in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one gate may overlap with the architect's project for the next gate.
In your view, the board has to ensure that the stripe directly above Rhonda de Dalt should provide a full area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released.
After 72 days of settlement, Red Casino's legal representative forgave Mayor Monterrey's brother in a lawsuit against him on the charge of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be free after the legal representative of Red Casino has forgiven him to the Second Criminal District Court, which is in the process of extorting the brother of Mayor Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly asked him to pay an economic contribution to allow the Monterrey authorities to allow a secret operation in the gambling house.
Following a public conviction, the Attorney-General opened a criminal case against the mayor ' s brother and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the State capital.
He remained in that location for 49 days, following the orders of the second non-transfer order, after the prosecutor had ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kadereita for allegedly extorting half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in a prison with a medium degree of isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his stay at the San Nicholas municipal prison in Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest order was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yanes, who said that after almost two months of investigation, it was quite evident that Jonas was guilty, such as charging 1.5 million pesos to bookmakers in exchange for authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released within the next hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor in court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether he had compensated for the damage and which of the partners in the gambling house granted a pardon, although the lawyer tried not to give a name.
On the basis of record 197/2011, Jonas Larrasabal has been granted a legal pardon, and no further statements can be made about the trial that was planned against him; nor will any compensation and punishment be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 15:50, the order was to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
A court clerk, Jorge Janes, went to San Nicholas prison in Garza to inform Jonach that he was legally forgiven and that his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hacome describes the details of the disaster that killed the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Minister of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that results obtained in an accident in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake Maura, and seven others were killed, showed that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in complete integrity, without the pilot attempting to make an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot had discovered that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the ship had several contacts with the ground, wings came into contact with trees 25 meters away, where the vehicle lost its fluselage."
He also stated that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, and that it met the necessary requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that studies conducted in the area of impact did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
“The study states that there are no components of the vessel elsewhere, and the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for the transport of passengers.
The ground in this place has a seven to 30 degree slope.
At this point, the secretary said, the most important thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study may take months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the strike, a presidential helicopter was operating at cruise speed and that it happened on soft rising soil.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal flight manoeuvre at the moment of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Perez Hacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was conducted according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified suitable conditions for taking off when the aircraft headed towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexican State, where clouds were seen at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that because of cloud conditions, the team was searching for a lower altitude and greater visibility in the Quernawak Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording from the aircraft radar probably did not lose control or change direction before the impact.
Fragmentation of debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact was on the front and side lines.
The dispersion of the debris suggests that the helicopter encountered the ground under structural conditions.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
Undetected evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire remains in the disaster zone.
Recent research shows that there may have been multiple contacts with the land.
During the work on the site, pieces of aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground ranges from 7 degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several clashes with the ground.
After careful research, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found in larger areas than the defined area near the site of the disaster, thus reinforcing the assumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity.
MSS announces an obese gene search program
Social protection leads research on finding obesity gene in children and young people, supported by IPN experts
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it was conducting a study to detect the gene of obesity in children and young people, known as the protocol “Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence”, which would provide a count of overweight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Biochemistry Research Unit of the National Centre for Medicine of the Twenty-first Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been assembled.
This team is assisted by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Health Institute (NIPH) and the Centre for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The study invites the public (prescribed or not) to participate in the MSSI sports centres participating in the study in Mexico Valley, where children will be tested every Saturday morning at 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol had been launched at a sports centre in Cuautemoke (in western Mexico state) and that since 8 October, events had been held at a sports centre in Nesaualcoyotl (East Mexico state).
Once the goal of 500 to 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Centre (South Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north Mexico City).
He explained that the aim of the study was to understand the ingredients and importance of genetics for the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans in order to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
World Diabetes Day will be observed on 14 November, with the main objective of collecting 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14, with parental permission and supervision, to complete individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family inherited diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that an anthropometric measurement of all participants (weight, height and waist covering), blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) would be conducted on Saturday.
Cruz Lopez said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in child weight.
Medical studies carried out between 1999 and 2006 show that there has been an increase in just six years: 77 per cent of boys were obese, 47 per cent of girls; overweight also showed a significant increase,” said MSSI.
He said that the rationale for finding markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexican was 65 per cent American Indian, 30 per cent European and 5 per cent African, a condition that affected genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main effect of the genetics of obesity is the body's inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and it's stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck (acant) and forearms means the possibility of metabolism being violated and even prediabetes.
The information is treated with confidentiality, and the doctors give it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in lifestyle that must be made in order to avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there were three main reasons for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sitting life, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of television, and using transportation at short distances instead of walking.
This is also due to the high consumption of calories, i.e., increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (talamel, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetic predisposition analysed in the programme.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Raphael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of best quality, resistant to environmental and temperature effects.
If attention had been paid to the signals sent by the road surface, it would have been necessary to repair about 200,000 pits per rainy season in the metropolitan area of Mexico City, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of the paved road surface is correct, the number of pits can be reduced or even reduced to zero.
In his lecture, The Technology View of the Pits of the International Year of Chemistry reports that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture with characteristics close to the bitumen but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather was extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and, consequently, to counteract pit formation.
He explained that the bitumen, the heavier part of the oil, was the sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some high molecular mass, called asphalts, and others low molecular mass, called Maltens, which together gave the road surface its characteristic viscous behaviour.
The viscous behavior of the bitumen is the fact that at high temperatures it behaves like a liquid at 120, and at 50 degrees Celsius it maintains a near solid state, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance to street asphalt is not constant, but changes during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, has been said by a chemical engineer.
The scientist observed that the streets of Mexico City were mostly covered with flexible coatings made up of six layers of material, of which the last three included bitumen.
Among the uppermost layers is bitumen made of small stones, dropped into bitumen and then compressed.
Every stone that makes this coating, he said, is in bitumen.
When driving and working, this helps the force to spread very well over the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be distributed even better, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt surface, he added, there was a last layer called a layer of wear, which was made of a small stone, actually sand, also submerged in the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will be in contact with the wheels of transport, it should have more resistance than the asphalt surface and allow for road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and disseminate these forces, the wear layer also requires an appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the state of the asphalt.
When the ground is wet, the water penetrates the surface and it's hard for it to get out of it, it softens all the layers of the surface, and hence the formation of pits.
When the pits are formed, he said, the wear layer is first worn out, and only then does it affect the bitumen, but the damage does not occur instantaneously, a process that should be taken into account at the first indicators of maintenance programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transport is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each surface layer must always be linked to the transport load and this requirement must be guaranteed in order to prevent the frequent occurrence of pits.
Rafael Herrera said that relatively bitumen still has a lot to study and do, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help to fix pits with ease and without high temperatures.
What didn't the Valle candidate have to do to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysing the reasons that prevented Serena Melina Ramirez from getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Valle won the title of Princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca's only wish is to have the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna should have been content to be on the winners' podium with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her the new princess of Colombia.
With the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and the sceptre, the department has 14 crowned princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who were close to the crown but were declared princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domínguez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Laurent Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonzuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hiseie Alhore García (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie Garces Alhore (2008).
The question that many people now ask:
What's not enough? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite who, in each of the performances, demonstrated that she had everything to become the new Miss Colombia, for a reason she was elected Queen of the Police and the most beautiful person in Vogue, titles held by the Queens, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a part in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to respond convincingly to the question "What book characterizes you and why? " posed by Martin Murilla Gómez of the literary community.
She answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I definitely think that the book characterizing my childhood is a pretty deep book.
Today I'm reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; I'm also reading the book of Irina Nemirovsky, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Fire of Blood.
An answer that the jury did not like because of the term “culture” and, secondly, because it did not specifically explain how each of the books quoted described it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and satisfied with her outcome: "The universe is wise, what happens is happening."
All of you, please read a little, Little Prince is a great book."
Among the hypotheses put forward, Valle was burned by favoritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that, because she was preferred, she was greeted with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster's culinary contest, the public vote for the best national costume, and Queen Mother), “which aroused the jealousy of other candidates, caused the Queen's stress, and consequently she was not glistening on stage”.
And it was marked during her first appearance in her bathing suit on Hilton Beach and her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both of them, she felt that she lacked the strength and energy demonstrated by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for the "How's At Home" program on RCN, said that the fact that Milena was named princess "means that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition doesn't become queen."
Moreover, the representative of Valle had recently avoided contact with the press, and that had been wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why two days before the selection, Lucy Doty, a member of the international jury, said that they were looking for a woman dedicated to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Columbia, we must look not only at appearance but also focus on public consciousness before they compete, they should be involved in projects," she said.
There is also a suggestion that the representative of Valle sinned with the defects on her buttocks and the fibrosis that was visible on her stomach, but this is controversial, as the jury highlighted her as a candidate with "natural beauty," given her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen Jorge Hernán Orosco's consultant notes that Melina didn't have the best body, which was better, "but the fibrosis problems on my stomach, which were not very visible to me, caused her to lose her glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the error of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she was subjected to surgical intervention.
"Operations are good, but Miss Valle doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize that was first presented by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, the cruel prediction came true last night, they say it was a woodpecker that Raimundo gave Melina as compensation for losing her pleasure in getting the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting a year of government today, not as Queen, but as Princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at an international competition directly designated by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena contest, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of the man who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
A CSI from Cali went down in history as a man who confirmed Alfonso Cano's death.
The work of these employees is crucial.
On November 4, CTI Cali entered history as the man who confirmed the identity of FARC head Alfonso Cano on his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI forensics experts, Elizar Gonzalez, a man from Puerto Tehad who spent 21 years in judicial investigation, was on duty this week.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Chocó, where he often had to sneak through the jungle for more than five days to reach the location of the bodies to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and, after completing the relevant courses, he became a specialist in forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. hands and feet.
During the week of the Elizar operation, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Cauca to Palmira.
He knew he'd have to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the location where the body was located, he did not identify him from the outside; he was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed as a local farmer, with no glasses and much thinner.
But prints don't lie.
Using the magnifying glass, ink, spade, and flashlight, Elizar matched the body's fingerprints to those in the photos.
His eyes didn't fail, it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that it was the leader of the FARC.
Fingerprint search
The confession obtained from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar González at the press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant for the fingerprinting specialist of the Sijin unit in Cali.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a strict science, without error, and it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprinting specialists participate in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and identify the detainees.
Many offenders have forged identity cards or no documents at the time of arrest.
We're taking their prints and we're looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in the case of the theft, he had to carry a piece of the wall of the house because in that place the thief was holding hands to take possession of a safe, full of jewels and money.
"It's hard to work with walls because they're not comfortable surfaces for prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole palm and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he says.
Prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man was recently found with liquor bottles all around him.
In the course of the investigation, it was established that a relative might have been suspected of having committed the crime and that the fingerprints on the bottle did indeed match.
Although it doesn't guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A fingerprint specialist from CTI explained that a chemical or physical reagent was applied to locations where fingerprints were found.
When they appear, a scapula or tape is used to remove them.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into the register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not everything that you touch leaves fingerprints on it.
However, if possible, a comparison shall be made.
Angry People challenges the New York government.
Hundreds of protesters camped outside Zuccotti Square.
Some protesters listened to the court ' s decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park next door.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York City on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square, under the protection of a court order, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to seize another Big Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Zucotti Square, where they wanted to get to because of a court order that allowed angry people to camp in the square while the other part of the movement responded to the crackdown, seizing a park in the north of the city where further arrests were made
"Our idea is that, since the court won't allow us to camp in the square, we will camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zucotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a member of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the response of the angry people to the evacuation of the tent town ordered personally by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, had gone to court, where Judge Lucy Billings had issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, angry people have begun to seize a new park located at the site of the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel linking New York and New Jersey, and the Trinity parish.
For at least an hour, they could have occupied the place, but then the police arrived and started arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not give an exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that several hundred people were standing with tents at the location where the delegation of religious leaders went to show support to the movement in an attempt to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zucotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed pending the court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which will examine the legality of this morning's dispersal of the protesters.
Some of the protesters who were on their way there carried and distributed copies of that court order, and even gave copies to the police guarding the square, which led to “some small clashes”, said Bray, who stated that some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Occupy Wall Street movement and forcing them to comply with “laws that have been issued since the beginning of the seizure, or preventing demonstrators from re-entering the park with shops and other property previously used”.
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and demonstrators had been informed, but local laws prevented them from reopening tent stores and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zucotti Square at dawn, an operation in which some 200 arrests were made, and the decision was taken because the protesters “wrong the law”.
Bloomberg said that he had ordered the clean-up of the square because it had become “a place where people came not to protest but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others”, because “some businesses were threatened” and neighbours feared “the deterioration of the quality of life”.
The evacuation this morning was abominable and shows that Bloomberg is deeply interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” added a representative of the movement who condemns the mayor for “regarding freedom of speech”.
Those responsible for Capture Wall Street also indicated that they intended to organize “Gradia events” on Thursday, in collaboration with civil society organizations and trade unions, to recall the last two months of the protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show.
Along with Michael Buble and other outstanding Canadians, she will appear on the December 1st "Russell Peters Christmas" television program.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at Big Repair, a lifeguard at Malibu Rescue, Bunny at Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private TV CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the crooner (ballad performer) Michael Buble and other prominent Canadians, would appear on the December 1st Christmas programme as a very special Mary.
CTV now features footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for the widely distributed Internet-based domestic pornographic video, appears with her then-husband, the drummer of Tommy Lee's Mötley Crüe, dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll in the nursery depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently appeared as a guest on "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, Canadian singer Buble, who married at the end of March in Buenos Aires on the Argentine model Luisian Lopilato, is also involved in the special Christmas show CTV.
Recently, Buble called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Survived from the Earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent, thanks to domestic consumption, and put an end to the decline that began in March.
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralysed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that resulted in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the rising sun has suffered since the Second World War.
According to the Tokyo government’s first estimate, the material losses amounted to $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global situation, seems to be passing.
After three consecutive loss quarters, gross domestic product data clearly helped turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter and by 6 per cent on an annual basis.
Registered in the second quarter, the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012 and also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The renaissance may be partly explained by the revival of the purchase of machine equipment to rehabilitate areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami.
Indeed, companies increased their investment by 1.1%, compared with a 0.9% reduction in capital expenditure from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true change in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian momentum, which calls for the crisis to be used to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has been awakened mainly by the growth of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japan ' s GDP.
This figure increased by 1 per cent due to increased costs for cars, travel and recreation.
It's a yen brand.
Tokyo gave the domestic market, when the yen, the Japanese currency, became one of the “currency havens” chosen by investors who want to get rid of the euro area’s debt crisis and negative US forecasts, a privilege that pushes, like stone, into the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a major blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sonia, for example, blame the yen for their low performance from July to September.
As long as markets continue to siege the EU’s peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government does not reduce vigilance.
We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the dramatic rise in the value of the yen, said Economic Policy Minister Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries showed clear signs of a downturn in economic activity in September.
The indicator that predicts the break-ups in the world economy has shown that major forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the average of 100 points since it hit eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens once again provides the ground for doubt
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign any written commitment.
With the peripheral risk awards and the uncertainty that prevailed in the parks, Greece continues to wander through the maze that leads to a recovery from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consent” of the new transitional government of Ellada is imposed by Brussels rather than by the true belief of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient to apply them, the leader of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, said Papadimos yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow in a vote of confidence by the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras's message does not clarify his position: “We are prepared to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing”.
The conservative leader took one step more in his mood for the EU and the IMF, the organizations that should unfreeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needed, and explained that he would not approve of any letter of acceptance of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreou referendum claims, repeated yesterday that its demands are unequivocal: it will not resume assistance unless the new Government and leaders of Greece's major parties sign a “written agreement without ambiguity and as soon as possible”.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafai, said that the Troika inspectors could return to Athens “very soon” to discuss with the new government “what must be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been set.
There's enough thread in the Greek ball for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope."
The Queen emphasized Spain's “core” position in relation to this type of finance.
Spain “has occupied a prominent place in the world in the area of microfinance”.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that, in the past two decades, the country had become the second largest donor of cooperation instruments, whose “importance” she said was that it was “a tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind based on faith in people”.
Yesterday, the Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such action is “very necessary” to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “especially with the goal of halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, a level at which the “poverty line” is recorded”.
Spain “is still working” to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes up the task with all “responsibility”, says Doña Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women, the “major recipients of these loans”.
There are “many achievements” and “many difficulties we face”.
The Microcredit Summit is becoming not only a venue for debate, but also a platform that promotes “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that 175 million poor families would benefit from those financial services by the end of 2015 and that 100 million of those households would emerge from the poverty into which they were immersed.
The momentum for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world “has followed the path begun years ago” by Muhammad Yunus has been emphasized by Ms. Sofia as “an act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as “an amazing idealist in the global fight against poverty”, whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to explore his lending policy on the ground.
One year later, this experience was replicated by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I have seen continuous development everywhere”, said Her Majesty, whose connection to the project brought her the title of “family head” collected yesterday in Valladolid as a “banker of the poor”.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
“Ethical imperative”
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity was an “ethical imperative” for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with times of economic boom, as it was a “permanent commitment”.
Jiménez concluded that microcredit implied “a serious and firm commitment to poverty eradication”, and now “more than ever” the Governments of developed countries must work according to the criteria of solidarity and prevent it from falling.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, praised the “success” to give “confidence” to the “shared, closed doors”, and the Mayor of Valladolid Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed all present in the city, which “opens its doors in the spirit of solidarity”.
HDZ proposes to elect the Chairman of the European Commission by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDD) on Monday, 14 November, was held in Leipzig without major problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it came in the fall itself, in particular to satisfy activists who feel that government policy is far from being as strict as it should be today with regard to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with regard to Italy....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, which was introduced by the Presidency, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The standing ovaries, which lasted several minutes, earned their performances by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schöyble, the Eurofil and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The principal message of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is that the correct answer to the crisis is “no less than Europe, but more than Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the chancellor, "it's time for a breakthrough in Europe."
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty that allow the European Union to strengthen its control over Euro-zone financial policies, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by universal vote “to give Europe a face”.
At any rate, this is one of the proposals of a draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Schöyble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly accept this decision; Britain opposes it, and HDZ leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is against it, too.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh each European Union member country’s vote on the European Central Bank’s board according to the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Desiring to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the Congress at the expense of “small” European countries or countries in distress, which like to criticize the “higher” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devoted an entire paragraph to the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Only in passing.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig became a scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is hospital fraud?
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the government began to attack sick leave.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the family benefit fund and make a speech on this issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on combating social benefit fraud.
And in order to help this offensive, which arose out of a desire to save money in a difficult situation, but also as part of the campaign of the right-wing presidential re-election, most want to concentrate on hospital leaves.
In the first instance, with a view to budget savings, the Government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on employees of private companies prior to the start of payment of the benefit.
Apparently, without the employer ' s special consent, the worker will lose a four-day wage equal to at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to create a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, i.e., imposing one day on public servants without a sickness benefit (public employees have not yet had to wait for payment of a benefit, as opposed to three days for private sector employees).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority are also revisiting the topic of fraud, with a view to the abuse of sick leave.
Control is going to be tougher and tougher if you get caught, you're going to have to return all the payments you've illegally received," warned Xavier Bertrand on RTL on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of sick leave.
Indeed, they have been subjected to constant monitoring and political attacks since 2002, which have borne fruit.
People in France don't get any sicker than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the country figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than Euro237 million in daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensatory expenditures in 2008 amounting to 11.3 million euros accounted for 5 per cent of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent related to maternity leave and accidents at work and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, amounting to Euro6.2 million.
Consequently, 2.5 per cent of health-related costs were incurred.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group study.
An arithmetical average that conceals certain anomalies; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com’s career management website revealed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French workers interviewed said that they had not taken a single day of hospital care.
Another study, this time on health insurance, states that in 2010, 37 per cent of hospital patients were less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent were longer.
If you compare these figures with those of the European neighbours, you can see that French workers are no more likely to take sick leave than any other country.
A lengthy study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence rate in France (for reasons of health or not) varied between 10 and 11 per cent, compared with 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Hospital fraud rates are very low compared to grey employment.
As for the level of fraud, it's very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has resulted in a systematic check of hospital lengths of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term findings were “unjustified” or too long, or 37,050.
In the case of systematically checked sick leave of more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unreasonable”, or 132,000.
Overall, 169,000 cases were “unjustified” for several million workers who received sick leave.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, the figures for “grey” employment.
According to UMP Deputy Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, they amount to between Euro9 million and Euro15,000 million in lost revenue per year, which is higher than the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than the loss from fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
This was stated by Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos in Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition Government were not sufficient to carry out this task.
“In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme,” said the head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on a vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the new Government's “major task” because the country's presence in the eurozone is at stake, he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos projects that the country's budget deficit will be reduced “to about 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects the Measures of the New Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with his New Democracy Party deputies.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debts and combating waste, but also his rejection of any policy that impeded economic recovery.
Olly Renu, the European Commissioner for Economy and Finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary Euro8,000 million credit without written assurances from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and suicide need to be legalized with outside help, says the committee of experts.
Canadians are denied death, as stated in the Royal Society of Canada report
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee argues that the Government, health institutes and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, and this does not include cancer cases.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from different fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
The Committee suggests that the Government amend the Penal Code to allow suicide with outside help and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
For starters, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in 10th place, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death”.
Due to medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dead in hospital.
Québec has the highest rate of deaths in the country, with 86 per cent of deaths occurring in hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide with outside help, the report concludes that it contradicts the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the Penal Code with regard to euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse of use, i.e. the exercise of euthanasia or suicide with outside help against people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, during the teleconference Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed that the majority of such cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide with outside help were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide with outside help is practised in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 percent of Canadians advocate euthanasia because, according to an Angus Reid survey in 2010, they believe that this will enable people to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are of lesser value.
With regard to persons who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of those interviewed believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care, the situation was less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest, among other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that legal termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained to respect the end-of-life abandonment of health care without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee encourages the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal edification, which is already widely used in Canadian health-care institutions, the committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to dull physical pain like euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some experts in the field of health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health legislation, described as “extreme” the position of the experts who had signed the report because, among other things, it did not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide, says metre DeShan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place individual independence above all other values that constituted the social fabric of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
Health legislation expert Margaret Somerville also expresses “a strong disagreement with the findings of the report, which she described as a “manifest for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, inter alia, the report's findings regarding abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with outside help are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls upon President Assad to surrender power
Damascus condemns the “contestation”
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The supporters of Bashar Al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure intensified on Syria, Bashar Al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists it and condemns the “contestation” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria's neighbours, Turkey and Jordan, called for the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader yesterday to call upon President Bashar Al-Assad to cede power to Syria, where some 40 more civilians and members of the regime's armed forces were killed.
“If Bashar were to have the best interests of his country, he would have to resign, but he would have also had to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an BBC interview.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, in turn, expressed regret that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey is increasingly committed.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “enhancement of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly firm stance against the repression in Syria, as pointed out by Mark Toner, a representative of the Department of State.
Since then, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime ' s armed forces have died in the Dar ' a area in southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents died in an exchange of fire and heavy machine gun fire in Jobar in the besieged town of Homs, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.”
He also reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to remove Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, promising that this plot against Syria will fail.”
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and demands that 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers be treated in the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also advocated dispatching UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime that, he said, fell into “paranoia”.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the recovery plan adopted on 2 November, which includes the withdrawal of armed forces from fighting cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision “incorrect”, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to emerge from the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from markets and sacrifices from Italians.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to form his team and execute a program that would require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s rule.
The former European Commissioner participated in a discussion with political parties yesterday before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a programme involving many victims, said Francesco Nukara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups participating in the discussions following a meeting with a candidate for Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Feeney, said that he would wait to see if Mario Monty would ask Parliament to vote in confidence by Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monty presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of the country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In “democracy needs time to prepare the government and the program, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding”.
His appointment as president was initially endorsed by markets, but concerns arose again, in particular after the sudden fall of industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister was to form a team comprising, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new Government would have to be in place until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will have a vote of confidence in Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that when he took office, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important actor in Europe.
European Commissioner Olly Rehn stressed that “in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet its 2013 budget, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, had demanded, inter alia, new stringent measures.
The Italian boss boss boss, Emma Marchegalya, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit.”
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), presented the “change of the era” for Italy after 17 years of “Berlusconism”, “Professor” representing “the challenge of seriousness” and “the other Italy”, according to the authors of the editorials.
The great unknown is the durability of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid an early election, as by April 2012, Italy would have made payments of 200,000 million euros in public debt.
A Russian scientist helped Iran’s nuclear program
Russian scientist Viacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, confirming on Monday an American agency specializing in nuclear danger.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of that United Nations agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years “from the 1960s onward at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds using explosives”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to set up a company producing nanoalms in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, pending his return to Russia.
In its report, IAEA refers to “obvious indications that Iran's development of the nuclear detonator system” “was facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technology well, but who also informed the agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology as part of his home country's military nuclear programme”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, between 2009 and 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence decreased slightly or did not change during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4 per cent in attacks on Jews and an overall increase of 14 per cent in religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After a decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is rising again, and Human Rights First, Human Rights, “the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, adds the organization in an official communication.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered serious human rights violations”, added Paul Lejandra, a leader of the organization.
“The American Government can and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
“Hate crimes” in the federal law are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and today's sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and becoming Facebook-like
On Monday, Twitter's microblogging site changed the presentation of its platform to allow users to see, among other things, the activity of those they're watching, which makes it like Facebook.
The new "activity" and other "name" tab allows you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other Twitter users, the Internet users whose messages ("tweet") you are tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This provides an opportunity to learn if they publish messages, if they sign new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "at a low percentage of users in August" before being released on a wide-area basis on Monday, and announced AFP press secretion of Twitter to Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which for a long time has been known as intuitively rather incomprehensible and as using rather vague terms (RT to reconnect someone else's communion, #followfriday to recommend tracking other users), is mainly taking pleasure in experienced users, thus opening itself up to a wider audience, presenting users with something closer to popular Facebook and Google+ social networks.
On the Internet, users discussed this innovation through tweets on the Internet.
"It's useless, obsessive and overly Facebook-like."
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream, writing @dannykronstrom.
Austria
The “gold rule” budget in the Constitution
The leadership of the great coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to put the budget “gold rule” in the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible downgrading of Austria's public credit rating (triple A) by rating agencies.
The Chancellor of Social Democrat Werner Faymann himself announced this decision at the end of a meeting of the Council of Ministers, with an Austrian public debt of 74.6 per cent, significantly higher than the 60 per cent threshold set by the Maastricht Treaty, but lower than the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria’s solvency had fallen by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three thousand million euros more each year, the argument of Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger of Christian Democrats.
Austria is thus implementing the Euro-zone summit on 26 October in Brussels; the heads of State and Government demanded a reduction in fiscal deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced government accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The Austrian Government's regulation resembles the “German model”, since Germany was the first European country to adopt this “rule”.
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget must be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the State budget of the federal State must not exceed 0.35% of GDP in any year, and the land, like the communes, must present balanced budgets.
The goal is to bring public debt below the 60 per cent target set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Yoshihiko Noda
threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japan’s Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would carry out new intervention in the currency market if the value of the yen continued to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the yen to be too volatile, explain Mr. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen grew almost to a historical point that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new record of strength since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown constantly, driven by the purchases of investors who perceive it as a haven in these troubled times of global economic collapse and Europe’s debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic benchmark of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the last intervention.
On the eve of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted into a national currency.
“Japan is fighting to rebuild itself” after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), Mr. Noda stressed that he feared that the growth of the yen would kill the fragile embryo of recovery.
The world ' s third-largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, owing to increased exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect Japan's “fundamental economic performance.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy manager of Hiroheed Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps” to make it clear that no further mitigation was expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting in late October, the issuer increased by 5,000 million yen (47,000 million euros) the purchase of treasury bonds, raising to 55,000 million yen (519 million euros) the ceiling on the amount it allocates to the purchase of various financial instruments to fill the stock market.
Eurozone
The stakes are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating.
The risk of exposure to the debt crisis is undermined by European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in fragile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the eurozone’s stability, European exchanges went a little further into the negative zone this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and finished the bidding at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
With the new difficulties of lending to eurozone countries in difficult circumstances, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"Concerned investors are just too concerned about the risk of contamination," explains Terry Pratt, the institutional broker IG Markets, quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo exchange closed with a 0.7 per cent drop in new market doubts about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has set its sights on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in a corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized”, says Mitsushige Aquino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concern about the eurozone’s future beats a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest point in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, falling by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, she fell after the congress of Chancellor Angela Merkel HDZ on Monday, at which a resolution was adopted providing, inter alia, for a country in difficult circumstances to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are well above 6%
The lending rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
This Tuesday morning, Italian ten-year bonds reached 6.85%, and Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2 percent.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the exchange for time to restore the situation in Italy, which is under threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be his Government's “core objective”.
Spain was hit by markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
Ten-year interest-rate spreads between Germany and Spain reached a new historical peak.
Waiting for Eurozone growth figures
France recorded economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent due to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised the second quarter downwards, with 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) falling instead of stagnating.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogma.
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be made after a brief discussion or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that electoral meetings become an occasion to reflect on the share and place occupied by nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options have been explored.
France should base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
We are now 7,000 million people on the planet, and demographic development will entail doubling the need for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, bearing in mind the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances, a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident doesn't change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision contingent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or of Switzerland, which intends to build only the most advanced reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil are just a few of those who are resolutely pursuing their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to add one installation to its set by resuming construction of the station, which had been interrupted after the accident on Tri Mile Island.
Although the German renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
Berlin’s choice will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, compounded by an increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be visible.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European Turbine Championship, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to intermittent wind, resulting in carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices being 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy, energy prices are key to competitiveness and to the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any meaningful reduction in nuclear power will result in a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will illusoryly portray the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French refuse to pay, especially since they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole array of specialized international trade-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to donate a large number of these facilities and lose 6,000 million euros a year to French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician engineer will order an EPR calculated to work for sixty years if the manufacturer is scheduled to close?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions by Areva demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of safety is undoubtedly a vital issue for nuclear energy
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as Flemishville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are filled with the same obsession with security.
Over the course of 50 years, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any impact on humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the reactor's device and an inexcusable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented power that caused tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will learn from the accident, as it has learned from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between security agencies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, presents a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all energy experts who wish to build a reactor, stopping it in Flemishville will be an excellent gift to Areva and EDF competitors, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best mix of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogma and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a benefit to the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized on various sides - the overloading of police, judicial and administrative services subordinated to the policy of numbers and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a “State of human rights”.
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which came into the news when the Home Secretary (“Liberación” of 23 May) stated that France “does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters”.
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is much agreement between the right and left.
On the right hand, Jacques Chirac stated in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers” and on the left by Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “can't accept the world's poor”.
The only difference is in the level of generosity.
In 2005, fear of intrusion into the country by a Polish plumber was felt by both left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
The only difference is the level of generosity that they would be willing to show to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confined himself to platitudes, saying that “joint work will solve our immigration problem”.
This perception of immigration as a burden and a problem may offer an electoral advantage, but it is economically costly.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing recent immigration data (Special People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Publishing, 352 pages), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that accept immigrants.
Restriction of immigration weakens growth and reduces employment.
The fear of the influence of immigrants is based on the notion that they can replace local workers, especially the low-skilled, by triggering wage declines.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than replacing local labour with jobs that lack local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, the complementarity that exists between local and immigrant workers has led to a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1 per cent increase in migration flows resulted in an increase of 0.6 to 0.9 per cent in real long-term wages.
This is without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of the Nobel laureates in America are naturalized immigrants, while Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net profit in social security systems, accounting for an average of 1% of total European budgets.
The World Labour Organization estimates that, for example, in Germany, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 years will earn a net income (income minus expenditure) to the State budget on average of 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was about to take on the missing growth points.
These teeth, which were used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, by inventing it in Athens more than 2,000 years ago, in the twentieth century it survived the tragedies of the I World War, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that it was enough for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies to vote and make it as direct as possible.
It's been known since Napoleon's "Little" that it comes from the superficiality of thinking.
Universal suffrage, while a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even become an “instrument of oppression”, as was once said by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vashro.
No, democracy requires many other things - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of power, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political and democratic crisis.
In that regard, the palinodia of the true Greek referendum would have a double disparaging effect, demonstrating both the need for a major policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved and many believe that Republican soldiers are now targeting the wrong direction.
We will not win by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
Cart Blanche for an absolute European monarch or a jump with bound legs into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine blade, but of implementing -- jointly, clearly and continuously -- choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and we don't know how many more to list, because there's only one crisis: Europe's crisis.
All of Europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
Europe is totally humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
There is an urgent need to return the administration of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because it is only by working together that Europeans can reduce the burden of everyone’s debt, free themselves from markets, and prepare themselves for the future by investing in it.
Recovering from the crisis will require decisions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone now demands a European economic government.
Let's do it.
But to imagine it without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has taken place is yet another madness and a new impasse.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, we had to "create" the Republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a Europe united on an economic level.
This can be done only through the creation of a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine popular European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are spreading more and more widely.
The World Chip Card Exhibition opens on Tuesday in Wilpent under Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end with 11% growth in world microprocessor sales (bank cards, SIM phones), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6,000 million units.
Most important is the non-contact technology sector, which makes it possible to pay for public transport or purchases by simply mapping the reader.
This year, 460 million uncontacted chip cards will be sold to the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) to almost 10 per cent of the world chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, long behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of non-contact payments.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest point of view: 400,000 uncontacted Visa cards are in circulation.
But big stores are getting faster.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCard.
To move faster, banks need to equip their clients with equipment.
“Two large organizations in France have promised in the future to circulate systematically to their clients bank cards adapted for non-contact use,” said Gerard Nebui, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments with a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage in the development of a future payment tool, a mobile phone.
So far, only a few machines are equipped with NFC (NFC Communication) technology to perform such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they should really fly next year."
"We are counting on world sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012, explains Mark Burten, the head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced the experiment from December to June of next year in Qana.
The iPhone machines will be equipped with covers for approximately 200 clients and staff members, providing non-contact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
Société Générale also stated yesterday that he was preparing to launch an offer that would allow his clients to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spreading from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-sought links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that the Algerians were now confident.
“The facilities used by the two organizations and the reports of the secret services show that they are cooperating actively,” he explained without going into detail.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
An investigation into the abduction of two French men in the Niger in January revealed two links.
The people who had been abducted at a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leokur and Vincent Deluri, were apparently killed the following day, together with several of the kidnappers, during an operation conducted by French special forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone SIM cards belonging to terrorists.
Terror axis
An analysis of the calls made indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one refers to a Nigerian who lived for a long time in Midighuri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram's cradle, and the other to a person who is said to be close to Aqmi and a sect.
"This is a step forward, but we must certainly wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and in its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now exerting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of enlightened people with no interest.
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at the mosque, school and Imam fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means “Western education is sin” - preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict observance of the sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central government.
It targets mainly churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, activists in Boko Haram were particularly active in numerous attacks against police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the cult is radicalizing and going beyond its northern towers.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in Jos, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram organized the first suicide attack on a strengthened police headquarters in Abuja.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which comes from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a matter of concern to all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi is strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from Al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during an interview with Presidents Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his readiness to share all available information.
The world, as the Republican presidential candidates see it.
With regard to China, Iran, and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and incompetence.
Can a crisis - weakened America lead a complex world with simple, or more precise, simplistic ideas?
If you listened to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have been multiplying loud but lacking details about the foreign policy statement, which has traditionally been a strength of the Republicans.
The slogans about China, Iran, and aid to Israel are often mixed with one another.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chances of being promoted by the Old Good Party, threatened to file a complaint with the WTO against the Chinese and accuse them of “the manipulation of their currency is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
Even worse, if it led to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China, and the only candidate with an understanding of complex foreign policy, failed to resist a position that indulges in emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is at the bottom of the ratings, remains unheard.
Reagan-style.
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions failed to stop his nuclear program.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran, he'll tell me."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of not fulfilling his promises to that partner.
Businessman Herman Kane, second in the list of candidates, showed a disappointing lack of knowledge of cases.
He recently called for a response to the Chinese military threat, because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power, obviously not knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes against Iran, says he is prepared to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The torture of terrorist suspects banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Kane, Perry, and candidate Michelle Bachman.
This is far from John McCain, the 2008 Republican candidate, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to lower the tone of the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of “children” from Iraq, and on his manoeuvres in Libya, which gave him the reputation of weak politics.
But the offensive isn't that easy.
The public believes that Obama’s national security balance is positive, and that it has eliminated Ben-Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are stuck in the sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be re-engineered economically in order to regain its leadership, Obama is right.
Northern flow, new gates for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The northern pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly to the Baltic Sea bottom has been launched.
It is designed to provide gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas manufacturer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pomp.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic coasts between the orchestra and the exquisite snacks, opening the Northern stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fiyon and his Dutch counterpart, Mart Rütte, together turned the symbolic valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new pipeline will provide 27,500 million additional cubic metres of gas each year to Western Europe through the first 1,224 km pipeline connecting Leningrad region to Meklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline is due to be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all France ' s consumption.
The possibility of constructing a third pipeline along the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The draft met with strong resistance from Poland and the Baltic States.
The Northern flow would indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: they will become more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to shut down Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop at comparing the Northern Flow with the new “Germano-Soviet Pact”, hinting at the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But at the cost of draining Europe’s energy, because the project created a gap between eastern and western Europe.
Russia has managed in less than five years to reach its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already running out.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it's a new artery that organically binds us," said François Fiona, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent big gas contracts are both politically and economically important.
This explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel, trapped in concrete, to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
In order to build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left over from the Second World War.
"A hundred needed to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, North River Press Secretary.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffel towers, without ruptures along its entire length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not thrilled that a Russian state-owned company would permanently settle off its coast.
"In the event of an accident, we'll block the gas flow in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
So in the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But it seems unlikely to the designers who designed stitches designed to leak only once every 100,000 years.
The gas pipeline will be monitored by an underwater robot that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as by an apparatus that circulates inside the pipeline.
A cigar-shaped apparatus is inserted into a pipe 1 metre in diameter and pushed forward by a gas stream.
Upon arrival after three full days of travel at a rate of 3 metres per second, he gives accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any repairs.
The gas shall be Circulated only by its pressure.
It's 200 bars on departure and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies joined forces to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), Dutch Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9 per cent each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called the Northern Flux, which was tasked with the construction and operation of a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Tsuga, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for 20 years, with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for the full volume, no matter how much gas is actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The pipeline was financed by 30 per cent of shareholders and 70 per cent of bank loans.
The total cost of the work would be Euro7.4 million for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay back their costs because Gazprom is taking all the risks.
The pipeline exits the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to the sandy shore planted with conifers.
The valves are 4.5 metres high and form a gas outlet terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 it will be 6 million.
Moleskine's brand notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will restore the taste of the letter.
He has the aroma of adventures, hours spent behind a letter in the candlelight.
Moleskine's notebook is easy to find on the rectangular black cover, on the rubber, on the yellowish-white pages, as if it had become yellow over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, has decided to market designer notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's then consultant, claimed responsibility for launching a new product.
The notebook is inspired by old manufacturing techniques, a moleskin, a polished cotton cloth used, for example, to cover benches.
This type of notebook is said to be highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to today's taste the old and forgotten thing that was a cult for avant-garde artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the manager of the brand in Modo Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent to 12.7 million.
We have gone a long way from producing the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Setting the profile of a typical customer is hard because the notebook attracts a businessman, a student, and a free-trader alike.
The customers of Moleskine are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
A small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in small towns, and has been able to gain widespread publicity.
“We have followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter despite the advent of e-mails,” Maria Sebregondi explains.
This cultural feature is a follow-up to the development of Moleskine; recently, the brand organized an exhibition called "The Circle Way", where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched the cover of a leopard painting for the Locarno Film Festival.
Using his successes and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and brand includes all kinds of support.
Success, which gave rise to envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, who wrote a new page in Moleskin's history.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19 per cent of persons with disabilities seek work.
The 15th week of employment for persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19 per cent, compared with 9 per cent for the general population.
Disappointing?
"No," stresses Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for the disabled."
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was three times higher than two."
"However, there's still a lot of work to be done."
It must be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for a disabled person.
Of these, 37 per cent are older than 50 (17 per cent on average).
They are more likely to have low qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a bachelor ' s degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread, at 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and which are the essence of the problem”, according to Christian Grapin, Director General Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire a disabled worker.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about a mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
A study carried out in April by IMS-Entreprendre for Cité showed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability and “perceived people in wheelchairs or with mental or mental disabilities”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the target of 6 per cent of disabled workers set in the 1987 law.
The last known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"Today we're about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiff, an organization responsible for collecting tax from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “taxable” organizations decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which raised the tax, put a lot of pressure on the companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a growing awareness, particularly in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday (20.45 a.m.), Eden Azar and Georges Leakens did not hide the pleasure they had received from this friendly match.
We won't get to the point that there was a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the arenas of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar made peace.
Five months after his attacker played against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only commend him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to go on," says player Lille.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the team, it's one thing, it's justified.
"I'm in Lillah all year round, and I'm not in Belgium."
"I have to earn points."
Left behind, in the run-up to this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to Saint-Denis to finally shine.
Not forgetting, however, the notion of pleasure.
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the 1998 and 2000 victory campaigns.
"I've always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special nature of this match.
Especially that Mathieu (Debushi), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami) are on the other side," he recalls.
"Just our paths crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leakens was kind enough to think of "gloriousness."
"Pride" to play in the holiday match.
"Pride" is also to say, as a "cosed," that France "has once again become a very high-level team" just a year after the trauma in Naise.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderbolt, admired by him.
Now that Belgium's missing the next Euro, the tech athlete will be flying in the same plane with the blues... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will see that in future matches, including this one against France."
Portugal is very confident.
Portugal, Paulo Bentu, is starting its retaliatory match against Bosnia this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On his way, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bentu already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the team, which has been running it since September 2010, qualifies for the Euro 2012.
Portugal's only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a match to play and Bosnia to win.
With 0-0 on Friday in hell, it's clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the cherished goal of calming it.
"It's a good result, but it does entail a certain risk."
But at their brightly lit stadium de la Lus in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, which should be thrilled, though the match will be very tense," said the optimistic but sensible Bentou.
"We're expecting a very intense match, but we're convinced we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50 percent chance of going to the Euro 2012," said Carlos Keiroz's successor.
A tie in a match against Bosnia on Friday requires the Portuguese to win.
No one could have done it for the Bosnians.
"That's a good result, but there's some risk, "sorry Bent.
"We will play against a team with many technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning, "no time to think."
It's a good idea if it's real this time.
