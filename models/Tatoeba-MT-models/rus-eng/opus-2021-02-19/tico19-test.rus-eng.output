Rapidly increasing cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
Cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and Great Britain, confirming that, despite different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, there is a need to improve preparedness for the influx of patients with COVID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan of Hubei Province of China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronavirus, now known as type 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), was responsible for the infection.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called a coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 suffer from a mild form of disease, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with the majority recovering.
Approximately 14% of the cases of COVID-19 develop into a more severe form of disease with hospital needs, while the remaining 6% take a critical form when intensive treatment is required.
The mortality rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
This study analyses cumulative trends in COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) country and in Great Britain and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK with data for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and Great Britain
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing in the same way as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveillance of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the existence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, with all three patients returning from Wuhan in Hubei Province of China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in Great Britain, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750, including 1,441 deaths, occurred in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates data on the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country of the world daily at 8 a.m., from official sources such as the ministries of health of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with Italy.
A reduced cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in 14 days, based on the normal COVID-19 current in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020, was calculated as an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases.
We also provided a cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at 8 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in the development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and Great Britain
The 14-day trend of reduced cumulative morbidity in EU/EEA countries and in Great Britain was generally similar to that observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (figure 1).
Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole began to increase around 21 February, and there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material) on 28 February 2020.
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and in Great Britain there were similar trends in cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK compared to the same for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as at 8 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in Great Britain is comparable to that recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
The cumulative trends observed in COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the different stages in different countries, differences in the response of national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the admission of cases and different rules for the selection of patients for COVID-19 testing, including “completion” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 required intensive treatment, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already as full as possible.
To date, data on admissions from COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) intensive care units in the EU/EEA are only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (no data provided).
However, such data should be systematically collected to complement current observational data on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, the number of beds in Europe varies widely in intensive care and intensive care units, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated report of the ECDC on the results of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 presents scenarios of the download of health system resources, with estimates of the hospitalization of patients of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of a shortage of accessible beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
As cases are currently grouped into certain EU/EEA and British regions, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, it is recommended that information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units be provided, if possible, at level 2 units of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the long-lasting SarS-CoV-2 contact-infection scenario and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen in the affected regions of Italy, for example.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and integrated approach to containing the spread of SARS-COV-2 is important, with a consequent shift from containment to minimization, because, given the predicted rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to think about, adopt and adjust their responses accordingly if such measures are not taken in advance.
The rapid risk assessment report also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time in which they can intensify their monitoring efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks, health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive treatment.
The coronavirus outbreak of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was a tragedy for humanity, with more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 infections occurring in China and elsewhere in the world.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus that developed severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower degree of disease and mortality than SARS, but it is much more contagious and afflicting older persons than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the new disease, this article offers a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject matter of research.
We will consider basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction of further currents and prevention of the disease.
While many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The spring celebrations (Chinese New Year), which fell on January 25, 2020, were unprecedented and unforgettable for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for weeks after the outbreak of a new viral infection.
Given the high degree of resemblance to the coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the virus SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease a coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout the country, followed by nearly 50 other countries in the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been detected, more than 40,000 patients had recovered and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy to society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have been published, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report, dated 7 January 2020, which defined the sequence of the virus separated from a number of patients.
The review is an attempt to synthesize research findings in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus-induced disease, the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which erupted in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known so far about the prevention and prediction of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among pathogens that are not fatal to humans and are mainly responsible for about 15% of total respiratory infections.
Nevertheless, this century has seen twice the highly pathogenic human coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of disease in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other states with appalling levels of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the present COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the reported clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of the People ' s Republic of China from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that medical staff were infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted from human to human beings.
On 23 January, a quarantine was imposed on Wuhan city and urban public transport was stopped.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with a confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered to be the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the coronavirus outbreak was a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to approximately 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and risk of an outbreak has yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-central clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed by COVID-19, provided the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
All age groups were affected by SARS-CoV-2, but people between the ages of 30 and 65 were the most affected.
Almost half (47.7%) were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
Infection of SARS-CoV-2 among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was spread in clusters mainly in Hubei province and in the surrounding regions.
The average period between the onset of the symptoms of COVID-19 and diagnosis was 5 (2–9) days.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 days (3.0–7.2 days).
From the onset of symptoms to death, it averaged 9.5 days (4.8–13).
The base reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the corrected R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons, coinciding with large-scale traffic on the eve of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Mortality among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%) and the corrected mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02%–4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one thread of meaning RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and betacoronaviruses are known to strike people.
In the case of coronaviruses of type SARS and MERS glycoprotein of shypoid processors (S), it is connected to the cell receptors of type 2 angiotensin-transverse enzyme (ACE2) and dipetidyl peptidaze-4 (DPP4), respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
The cytoplasmic genome is released by the viral RNA genome; following the replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with glycoproteins and proteins of the nucleocapside, generates virion-containing vesicles that then merge from the membrane cell, releasing the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence reports were released on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of betacoronavirus, with 99.98% of the genome corresponding to 10 consecutive samples collected at the first outbreak of the disease, at the Juanan seafood market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With the help of a tracer microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultra-fine portions of the human respiratory epithelial.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human enzyme ACE2 is weaker than in SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients less serious illness than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-lived protein encoded orf3b and secret protein encoded orf8.
The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can play a role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the expression IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou submitted reports on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-size ACE2 enzyme of a human with a 2.9 Å resolution combined with an amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-protein, which is evidence of the detection and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate master
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to be bats from which the virus was transmitted to humans through the cyst and camels, respectively.
Using a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 were bats, as the new virus was 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely the coronaviruses of the bats SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of intermediate host the virus has been able to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the route of transmission has yet to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that snakes had become vectors of the virus from bat to human, resulting in a homologic recombination in S-protein.
According to their research, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolines — long-fished mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results with concrete evidence are not yet available (figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
Under the laboratory conditions SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and between 40 and 50 per cent humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and to heat up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; ester, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorinated disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorohydride, can effectively block the activity of the virus.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to a new virus.
There are currently no detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 conducted.
So we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, the virus in the host body first recognizes the innate immune system by means of image-recognition receptors (IPRs), including C-type lectine receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus induces inflammation factors, the ripening of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrofags against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-white SARS-CoV can avoid immune response.
An adaptive immune response will soon be included in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ T cells and CD8+, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, while CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help the defense cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells, causing their programmed death.
Human immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies removed from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, hyper-reaction of the immune system results in the local formation of large numbers of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario, lead to polyorganic insufficiency and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestations, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or who have immune system disorders.
According to the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 1 to 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days.
However, 1,099 cases showed an average incubation period of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
More recently, a study based on the demography of 8,866 cases revealed an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0–7.2 days).
It is very important for the health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures to the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, thus preventing the spread of the virus to those infected with an unsymptomous disease.
A 14-day quarantine for persons with or infected with the virus has become common practice.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptoms of COVID-19 are often high temperatures, which may be the only manifestation or associated with other symptoms, such as dry cough, breathing difficulties, muscle pains, dizziness, headaches, throat pains, colds, chest pains, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients suffered from shortness of breath and (or) hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease advanced rapidly and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperatures and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathologies in chest images.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptoms: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% short breath and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilation of their lungs.
Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies of family infection and transmission of the virus from unsymptomous infections.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MERS-CoV, who also had high temperatures (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial ventilation of their lungs, which is much higher than in the case of patients with COVID-19, corresponding to a higher proportion of deaths from MERS than in COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperature (99–100 %), dry cough (29–75 %), breathing (40–42 %), diarrhoea (20–25%) and throat pain (13–25%), while artificial ventilation of the lungs requires 14–20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality rate from COVID-19 was 2 per cent, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide was 66,576.
In comparison, the mortality rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to an earlier study, the baseline reproduction (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at 95% of the confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures show that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for new virus infections is lower than the latter two.
Thus, containing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster manifestations often occur when infected within a single family or group of people gathered together for any reason or caught up in a transport, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often travelled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with infected or infected persons during the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be infected with the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and treated patients may be released from the hospital as carriers again, an alarming signal for an extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced levels of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed with lymph nodes < 4×109/L, including white cells < 1×109/L, as well as elevated asparagin aminotransase and virus.
Increased levels of liver enzymes, muscular enzymes and myoglobin were found in some patients' blood, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes in their blood.
In patients with severe disease, the D-dimer level, the fibrin decay product present in the blood, has been increased and the number of lymphocytes has been steadily decreasing.
In most patients with COVID-19, the chest X-rays detected pathologies characterized by uneven obscuration on both sides or by opaque glass in the lungs.
Patients often develop SARS, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (SAR).
Uncontrollable inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of the exchange of gas when the ARI develops.
Types I and II pneumocyte dysfunction reduces the level of surface-activated compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of lungs to expand and increase the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of X-rays often coincide with the worst cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the separation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes and inter-tissue lymphocytic infiltration, and multi-nuclear sincitial cells in patients who died of the disease were consistent with the pathologies of viral infection and ARI, similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The primary criterion used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a polymerazic chain reaction with inverse transcription (RCR with inverse transcription).
However, given the high level of false negatives that can accelerate the epidemic, since 13 February 2020, China has begun to diagnose on the basis of clinical evidence (no longer relying solely on reverse transcription PCRs).
The same was true of SARS diagnostics.
Therefore, effective diagnosis is critical and requires a combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results.
On 14 February 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the application protocol of SHERLOC, based on the repeat CRISPR methodology, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows the detection of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at a density of 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of reference sample) by using indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new technique, if successfully tested in clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of testing.
Due to the lack of experience in dealing with previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mostly only provide support therapy to patients with COVID-19, while trying to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or offered in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunity suppressors, steroids, recovery plasma, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
In the early stages of SARS-CoV-2, attacks mainly on the lungs, and possibly to a lesser extent on other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
Nevertheless, work disruption and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, in order to alleviate symptoms and save lives, it is critical to maintain the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical lung ventilation, which are determined according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of an excreta membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonal circulatory method used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining water-saline balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protecting vital organ functions, is critical for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokinic storm is known to be the result of hyper-reaction to the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
Cytokinic storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that evolves in response to a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immunocytes to emit huge amounts of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of the ARI and polyorganic insufficiency.
In the treatment of cytokinic storms, particularly in patients in difficult condition, the suppression of immunity is essential.
The cytokinic storm was treated by corticosteroids and tocilysumabes, monoclonal antibodies serving as an interleykin 6 inhibitor.
Other methods for treating cytokinic storms based on the suppression of immunity include modulation of immune responses aimed at controlling T cells; blockade of the production of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; suppression of the genus quinase; application of crepetomomaba, cytokinic signal suppressors 4 and hystondeacetales inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as inhibitors of immunity in the treatment of SARS viruses to reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes.
However, steroids in large doses are not useful in treating severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecosis, which significantly worsen the prediction.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended with caution in treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous remdesive, a nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesive is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, the remdesive also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other single-chained RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, Gilead has provided this drug formulation to China for couples research on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were suggested as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined lopinavire/ritonavire treatment can be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other prescribed drugs should be monitored with care.
Recovered patient plasma and antibodies production
Blood withdrawal from patients treated for contagious diseases, for other patients suffering from the same disease, or for the protection of a healthy population, has been used for a long time.
Indeed, the blood of recovered patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to control pathogens.
Antibodies are found in immunoglobulin, produced by B-lymphocytes to control pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.
Based on this assumption, plasma was removed from the blood samples of a group of patients treated for COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood saturated with oxygen.
However, to suggest mass use of this method before specific treatments are carried out, verification and explanation are still required.
In addition, in view of the therapeutic effect, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma use should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune system and cause cytokine emission syndrome, which, given its toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
Blood antibody concentrations are generally low, and plasma is required to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to single out V cells of recovered patients and to identify the genetic code of effective antibodies or to screen to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can go straight to mass production of antibodies.
Chinese have used traditional medicine for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on a combination of many components of a formula that differs in its composition from the diagnosis of a disease based on Chinese traditional medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or uncertain, as it is difficult to identify and test these components or their optimal combination.
At present, due to the lack of effective specific treatment, COVID-19 Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild and moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a serious illness.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rate of recovery from COVID-19 was found in several provinces in China where 87% of patients were treated with Chinese traditional medicine, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ninxia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hubei Province, where only about 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 were treated with Chinese traditional medicine, the lowest rate of recovery was recorded (13 per cent).
However, this is a rather crude comparison, since the assessment must take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively in Western medicine and combination treatment in Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time frame for normalizing body temperature, removing symptoms and providing in-patient care was significantly shorter for patients who had been treated in a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients treated only in Western medicine.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients with symptoms (light to heavy) started to deteriorate was markedly lower in the group treated through a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only by Western methods (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second group (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and security of Chinese traditional medicine still require more closely controlled research conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also interesting to have, whenever possible, a description of the mechanism for action and an explanation of the effectiveness or combination of components used in Chinese traditional medicine.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are mostly afraid of acute and even deadly disease, and quarantined people are also bored, lonely and extremely irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
During the early stages of the SARS virus outbreak, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including chronic depression, heightened anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psycho-psychological symptoms, delirium and even suicidal behaviour.
Mandatory surveillance and quarantine, which are among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase the anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma to their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to persons under suspicion and in contact with them, and to all other persons who require it.
Psychological support should include multidisciplinary mental health teams, regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the chain of transmission from animal carriers and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
S-protein-based vaccines have been developed to develop long-lived and highly active antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Lively weakened vaccines against SARS viruses have been developed in animal studies.
However, prior to clinical research, it is still necessary to determine the impact of these possible vaccines in the natural environment when applied to age-appropriate patients, the pattern of lethal doses and the degree of protection against the infection of zoonous viruses.
Perhaps the reason is because the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of diseases caused by the MERS virus continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions through the conservation of zoonous sources in endemic habitats.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using an inactive virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for persons without immunity is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed in order to contain the escalating epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long time (on average 18 months) required to develop the vaccine and the dynamic modification of the coronavirus.
Once an unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical current of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with the high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a predictive model of the disease in order to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the clinical evidence presented so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prediction of the current of patients with COVID-19 (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the current of the SARS virus disease, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study, 8,866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to have initial diseases and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (on average 66 years, compared with 51 years), indicating that age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men than among women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000) as mentioned above.
Incidence and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute myocardial and arrhythmia damage.
Cardiologic events were also the leading cause of death for patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also contact ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which could cause liver damage in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely interrelated and can distort results.
Deviations detected in laboratory studies: the C-reactive protein level in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage and is proposed as a potential predictive factor for disease currents, reactions to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between the C-reactive protein level, the severity of the disease and the COVID-19 projection should be taken into account.
In addition, higher levels of lactatdehydrogenase, asparagin aminotranspherases, alanin amintranspherases and creatinkinases can also predict the result.
These enzymes are released in large quantities by different organs, especially at heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: In order to predict results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, data from the chest X-ray study and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account, among other factors.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are inhibitors of immunity that are widely used in infectious diseases as supplementary therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Because corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecosis, causing permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be used in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with high levels of uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
Psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided in order to relieve the stress of such patients and help them to return to normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tracts, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in the upper respiratory tracts and cause weak symptoms or do not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who are in an early stage of the disease or who are not yet incubated can, through their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, making epidemiological surveillance very difficult.
However, the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, with most cases not occurring at an early stage of infection.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much bigger than the SARS epidemic, and it's harder to control.
China is currently engaged in a major effort to establish universal quarantine in Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as to extend the quarantine regime for virtually the entire population to break the SARS-CoV-2 virus chain.
While these measures have caused enormous damage to the economy and other areas of the country ' s life, the number of new patients identified has been declining, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will be over by March, and the phase will last three to four months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and his colleagues estimated that the outbreak of COVID-19, which appeared to be much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini have developed a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been detected in nose and throat swabs taken from patients who had recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that a new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the influenza.
However, the decline in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that current policies may have had an impact.
According to initial projections, Ebola was expected to hit up to a million people and cause half a million deaths.
But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
Like the SARS-CoV virus, it is likely that the infection potential of SARS-CoV-2 may weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a high rate of transmission through cough or sneeze, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been detected in the calve, which means that an oral-fecal mode of transmission is also possible.
According to a recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even others in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is wearing facial masks; both surgical masks and N95-class respirators (No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent microcaplets of liquid from flying in the air from potentially infected and from settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95-class masks (No. 1860s series) can protect viriones of 10 to 80 nm from inhalation; they only miss 5% of the viriones; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even the five surgical masks that have been put together, medical personnel who are in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series No. 1860s) masks rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health workers should wear a figure-shaped protective robe to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a class N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflammable eyes.
Medical personnel should therefore also wear transparent face panels or closed-type protective glasses.
All people in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more frequently with disinfectants, to try not to leave the home in a self-contained manner, and to limit contact with potentially infected persons.
An acceptable distance to the patient is considered a distance of about one metre.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was previously unknown to mankind, the high degree of its resemblance to SARS-CoV reported on 7 January 2020 was intended to be a wake-up call for China, taking into account the experience it had acquired during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Disease Control Centre in Wuhan calmed the citizens, saying that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity in human-to-human transmission and that prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement significantly reduced social tensions, especially as the entire country was preparing to celebrate China ' s New Year, and a critical time was lost when the disease could be contained within Mr. Wuhan with minimal losses.
China’s health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more careful public statements, as each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain a potential epidemic at an early stage of its development rather than to calm the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly monitor and improve the public response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the previously unexplored severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease had spread throughout China and, at the time of writing, had spread to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 gave rise to a sense of recidivism.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men than women; the proportion of cases and mortality rates among older persons are also higher than among young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even in an unsymptomous course of disease, while patients with SARS tend to infect people only in severe cases, so it's harder to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and bigger than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal samples for SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, treated patients can again show positive samples of the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Against the background of this rapid advancement of COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain to be resolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 per cent homologist between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat-like coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What kind of animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transmission route, and the epidemiological situation may deteriorate at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and induce subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically through human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS, or will it recur like a flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic, no matter what it takes, and to return to normal life as soon as possible.
Zoonous origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoV) were known to cause a mild disease such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The introduction of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China in late 2019 brought attention to the coronavirus and surprised us with a high transfer rate, but with a weaker pathogenicity than the related SARS-CoV virus.
The coronavirus infection of humans is zoonosis, and understanding its zoonous origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogenic.
There are also known intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses.
The definition of animal carriers has a direct impact on the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
The study of the interaction of animals carrying coronavirus can also shed light on the pathogens of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonic origin and modes of interspecies transmission.
It is important to note that we compare and compare different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of coronavirus, which was discovered in 2019 (COVID-19), is also considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for successful carrier changes and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of submachine viruses with one positive-polar RNA thread.
These viruses, with the largest RNA containing a genome containing 26 to 32,000 nucleotides, have been named because of their form, which, when viewed under an electronic microscope, resembles a crown.
In terms of structure, the coronavirus contains undisguised genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large, partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcast in polyproteins of pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, referred to as nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading frame for structured proteins, including the thorny protein (S), the shell protein (E), the membrane protein (M) and the nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronavirus also code a number of linear specialised accetor proteins.
Based on the different sequences, protein \coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses), with betacoronaviruses consisting of most human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and betacoronaviruses is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed interspecies barriers, and some have evolved to pathogens that are dangerous to humans.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five betacoronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the second type SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as cold and (or) diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory disease (SARS) and showing symptoms outside the lungs.
The first strand of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of patients who had a cold in the 1960s, separated from the nostril.
Since then, extensive research has led to more detailed knowledge of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were affected and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, and the disease spread sporadically to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, was discovered in 2019 and is the cause of the current epidemic of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), which, as at 3 March 2020, had killed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
An alarming signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are of zoonic origin, their sources being bats, mice, or pets.
Numerous data sets show in favour of the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to which viruses have been well adapted and in which they do not exhibit pathogenic properties, but exhibit a wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic posed a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge to China and the world.
A study of the zoonic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will make it possible to understand their natural history, the drivers of their evolution, and the limitations of interspecies transport.
It may also help or accelerate the search for a container, an intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, which is essential to prevent the disease from spreading again in the future.
This overview provides general information on zoonic origin, inter-species transmission and human coronavirus pathogenesis.
In particular, we refer to and consider the following general characteristic: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to the new carrier.
We are also looking at the trend in human coronaviruses, where increased transmission is often accompanied by a decline in pathogenic properties.
The result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered in this context.
Coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before strain B814 of the HCoV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample of cold patients separated from the nostrils, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been detected in recent decades.
Table 1 provides an informative and graphic summary of the historical history of the discovery of human coronaviruses.
The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tracts of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966; the virus subsequently adapted to reproduction in lung cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezes, general disease and throat pain, with high temperatures and coughing in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was removed from the organ culture and later a serial passage into the brain of the suckling mice.
The clinical signs of infection with the HCoV-OC43 virus are similar to those of the HCoV-229E virus, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza type A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are common worldwide and are generally transmitted in winter at moderate latitudes.
Most of the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a common mild cold.
Only a few patients with reduced immunity experienced severe lower respiratory infections.
The SARS outbreak, also known as “the epidemic of SARS pneumonia”, was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and the disease was caused by SARS-CoV, the third of the human coronavirus detected.
The first case of SARS was detected in the Chinese province of Guangdong at the end of 2002.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread across many countries and continents.
Excluding superactive distributors, it was estimated that each patient could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days; and the virus load peaked on 10 days of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially had muscle pains, headaches, high temperatures, general illness and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough, and respiratory failure.
The common laboratory deviations from SARS are lymphopenia, liver failure and elevated creatinkinase.
SARS patients also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and macrofags.
Approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients later require intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation of their lungs.
Other organs, including gastrointestinal tract organs, livers and kidneys, may also be infected in such severe cases, in addition to lower respiratory tracts, usually accompanied by cytokinic storms that may prove fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from the open biopsy of a patient's lung relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands was singled out for HCoV-NL63.
Initially, it was found to be primarily affecting young children, the elderly and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory diseases.
The diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 are characterized by cold, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolyte.
Another independent study described the release of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old Dutch boy suffering from pneumonia.
The virus has been detected in the Netherlands, but it is in fact widespread.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was allocated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with increased asthmatic disease.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes lung respiratory diseases, has been detected worldwide.
All four human coronaviruses causing non-hospital infections have adapted well to humans, and mutation leading to highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although the incidents were also unknown, as in the rare case of the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious infection of the lower respiratory tracts in China.
Usually, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic when they acquire the ability to transmit effectively and remain in the human body.
The Coronavirus of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first released in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure.
Most of the laboratoryly confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there were ingestion and distribution through occasional secondary cases of contamination with close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), both of which are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronaviruses transmitted to humans.
More than 30 per cent of patients suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, there were more than 2,500 laboratoryly confirmed cases of high-mortality Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent), so MERS-CoV is considered one of the deadliest viruses known to man.
From mid to late December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan of Hubei Province of China and are now associated with an infection caused by type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization announced that the continuing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 was a global public health emergency, and the disease itself was known as the Coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4 per cent.
It should be noted that the death rate is 4.2 per cent in the Chinese province of Hubei and 1.2 per cent outside.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by rising temperatures, coughing and breathing.
Some patients also suffer from diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become acute respiratory deficiency syndrome.
Despite the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses still form different branches of phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater transfer potential than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Symptomless SARS-CoV-2 infections have been recorded, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly throughout the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those most commonly observed in human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can be distinguished, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also highlights interesting patterns that characterize both human coronaviruses causing non-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it has yet to be verified whether the transferability of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each next person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause extra-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in scavenger samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as that of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses causing non-hospital infections.
Nevertheless, the future development of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 will depend on the features of SARS-CoV-2, including transferability, pathogenicity and sustainable distribution after human transition.
All four human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections with mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it may have been people who have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be described as the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses causing severe diseases in humans and people whose human coronavirus causes severe diseases simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in the human body to a sufficient extent that there is an accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the constraints of the host.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts, and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop its transfer among people through quarantine or other infectious disease control activities.
For many years, four extra-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population causing a common cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
The highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well enough to humans, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and to search for sensitive human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or augmentative carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features like SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four extra-hospital HCV viruses.
It's very easily transmitted as extra-hospital HCoV, at least for the present.
But it's more pathogenic than non-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts fully to the human being and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, augmentative and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
The animal is an evolutionary host of HCoV if it carries a close ancestor with the same high homology at the level of the nucleotides sequence.
The ancient virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this medium.
Similarly, the reserve carrier has been constantly carrying HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if the HCoV was only entered in an intermediate medium just before or around the time when it was introduced to a person, it was not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can be a zoonosic source of human infection and can play a reinforcing role by allowing the virus to be replicated by lightning and then passing it on to people, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV can withstand a dead end infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside the intermediate host.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to intermediate media and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes the natural container carrier.
Epidemiological evidence has shown retrospectively that SARS' zero patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Further seroprevalence studies have shown that animal traffickers have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV than the general population.
The Himalayan Cyvetes (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog in the animal markets were the first identified carriers of viruses like and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that no cases of SARS were reported after the destruction of all civites in the markets.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan cyvets, which lived in nature or on farms and were not marketed, were in most cases not defined by SARS-CoV, which suggests that the Himalayan cyvetes could only serve as an intermediate reinforcing medium, rather than a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.
It is noteworthy that since 80 per cent of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that many small mammals can also serve as intermediate augmenters.
They all seem to be dead end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
The subsequent search for the natural animal carrier SARS-CoV revealed a close family CoV bat, which was described as a coronavirus associated with SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 and which is present in Chinese submarine-borne bats.
These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% of the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.
Some SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been detected in bats, but none of them can be isolated as a living virus except one that designates WIV1.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be a human angiotensin-convulsive enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It has been shown that WIV1 from a sample of bat feces uses ACE2 bats, cysts, and humans as a receptor for entering a cell.
Curiously, the resuscitation serums from SARS could have neutralized the WIV1.
WIV1 currently represents the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homologue between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus SARS-CoV, and bats are not the direct reservoir carrier SARS-CoV.
Philogenetic analysis includes MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, Diepptyl diepptidazu-4 (DPP4) for virus penetration.
RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase sequences of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenically closer to the sequences of betacoronaviruses of bats detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild bats haven't found a living MERS-CoV virus.
The homologies of the MERS-CoV nucleotide sequences and his closest relative, CoV-HKU25, match only 87% of the bats.
So bats may not have been the direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-arm camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was separated from the nasal swabs of single camels, further confirming the role of camels as true MERS-CoV reservoirs.
It is also worth noting that camels with experimentally infected MERS-CoV had slight symptoms, but massive virus infection.
It is noteworthy that infected camels have released the virus not only by respiratory but also by fecal oral route, which is also the main route of virus separation in bats.
There are still questions, however, as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome have not had contact with camels in the past prior to the onset of symptoms and are likely to relate to human transmission or to the transmission of unknown channels that include unidentified species of animals that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The holology of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides coincides with 96.2 percent of the COV RaTG13 bats released from Asian Rhinolophus affinis pods.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute parental relationships to them.
So bats may not have been the direct reservoir carrier SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical coronaviruses of bats are found in the future.
Presumably, the direct carriers of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed in the Uhanian wholesale market for seafood, which was associated with many initial COVID-19 cases, indicating a likely case of animal transmission to humans.
Several recent studies based on methagenic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolines (Manis javanica) could also carry parental betacoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the nucleotides sequences of these new coronavirus pangolines is 85-92% similar to SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with an identity at the nucleotide sequence level of about 90%.
They cluster into two true differences of viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in a phylogen tree, one of which has a receptor-connecting domain (RDD) closer to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
On the contrary, RSDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more diluent, despite a higher degree of homology of sequences throughout the genome.
An earlier study of pangoline patients also reported on the definition of viral contigants in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of assembly and manual processing were used to produce a genome sequence of about 86.3% of a full-size virus genome.
The possibility that pangoline has become one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangoline.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangolines associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution path SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest homology of sequences throughout the genome.
Very theoretically, a high degree of resemblance between betacoronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal favours a recombination between betacoronavirus pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic viruses HCoV, the zoonous origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 viruses is also being investigated.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can be derived from bat coronaviruses, while parent viruses from HCoV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 strains are found in rodents.
It was reported that the bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and found near a North American trichromatic hickey, showed close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although it was suspected that camels might be its intermediate host.
For the sake of clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
Philogenetic analysis provided evidence of HCoV inter-species transmission events in history.
When the HCoV-OC43 virus was transmitted in interspecies around 1890 and people were infected by domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alphacoronaviruses of bats, closely related to HCoV-229E, were found.
Between them is the alphacoronavirus of alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could contact bats in the general ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpaks.
Second, bat alphacoronaviruses, related HCoV-229E, are diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronavirus has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alphacoronavirus of alpaca was not detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that the alpaca have received alphacoronavirus, related to HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipach and Hendra.
It is therefore not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while bat alphacoronaviruses could be a gene pool of HCoV-229E virus, alpaca and single-arm camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to single camels and from single camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known from its original identification and was later confirmed by subsequent studies.
Obviously, bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies gene exchange and interspecies transmission.
Long life, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats “the perfect distributors.”
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to a single camel a decade ago.
He has adapted well to these camels, which have become a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its occasional transmission to a human being is an accident, and the human being remains a dead end carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, betacoronaviruses of pangolines are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
They can be the dead end carriers of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as cyvetes in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities for inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be confirmed or excluded.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats through coal mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Second, pangolines can be one of the intermediate augmenting agents into which the related SARS-CoV-2 virus recently entered.
People are infected with the virus through carving and eating wild animal meat.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Domestic and wildlife tests for antibodies are justified.
Third, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolines.
Search for animal origin SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different species of animal carriers, the three main factors on the part of viruses have also contributed to the intersection of inter-species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered “moderately-high” with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 replacements per year in one plot 2 depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new owners.
Coronaviruses have a corrective exorbination, the removal of which results in an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakened or even non-violation.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesir suppresses the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exorbionuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesiver is one of the most promising tools against SARS-CoV-2 that need to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.
In addition, mutation frequency can often be even higher if the coronavirus is not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation frequency, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation frequency appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of human adaptation.
Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to the human.
Apart from SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-hull camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that vaccines and antiviral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly become ineffective as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses results in greater plasticity in the genomic modification of mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by the many unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the third end of the genome.
Third, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier, which serves as a mixing receptacle, threads are often switched.
High-mological, full-size and subgenic RNAs can recombin and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animals such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.
The interaction of the virus carrier with regard to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor is another key factor important for inter-species transmission.
This article cites SARS-CoV as a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection in inter-species transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis between SARS-CoV strains of humans and cyvetes, SARS-CoV is considered to be rapidly adapted in different media, especially with respect to mutations on RSD of S protein.
In general, the protein S RSD interacts with the cellular receptor, and the antibody response of the host takes it intensively.
SARS-CoV's RSD are amino acids, with 318th to 510th, on a fragment of S1 that connects to the angiotensinpreventive enzyme 2 (APF2) of humans, as well as their correptors, to introduce the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD can detect APF2 receptors from different animals, including bats, cyvetes, mice, and raccoon-like dogs, making it possible to transmit the virus in interspecies.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in the RSD, which differ from human viral strains and cyvetes, four of which are in a receptor-linking motive to interact with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civetes have mutations of K479N and S487T in RSD, which can increase the affinity of the interaction of the spiked protein with the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important for human adaptation.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30 percent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein segment S results in a change in the binding affinity of S protein to human APF2.
Indeed, research using a cryoelectronic microscope suggests that the affinity of this connection is 10 to 20 times higher than that between the human APF2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other correcipients were required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It's amazing that HCoV-NL63 is also connected to APF2, but to another segment of S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N aminopeptidesis for HCoV-229E and 9-O acetylsial acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans following interspecies transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to the receptors, the inter-species transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other media dependency and limitations.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural HCoVs reservoirs, such as bats, single-hull camels and rodents, can constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Successful inter-species transmission of HCoV requires the usurpation of dependency factors and the subordination of vector readjustment factors.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between virus and host still need to be defined and categorised.
An impartial full-genome screening of dependence and retrieving factors for SARS-CoV-2 can yield good results with the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCoV: Back to zero
The variety of bat coronaviruses provides a wide range of opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is considered important for human adaptation, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but it has been established that they encode the Divergent proteins of ORF8.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide separations have been detected in SARS-CoV coronaviruses.
This division splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-coronavirus lines, where RNA-dependent RNA-Polimeras has identified a large number of smaller recombinant sites.
The location of the recombination was also determined in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, the epidemic MERS-CoV was exposed to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in a single camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs where HCoV recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which is likely to result from the removal of the virus from the breeding pressures provided, for example, by the immune system of the host.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to a binucleotide separation.
While an internal open frame of ORF4 reading can be seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alphacoronavirus of alpaca shows a single nucleotide insert, which leads to a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also due to the sampling pressure on their reservoirs.
Infection of bats with coronaviruses resulted in low or no symptoms, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed by the apregulation of the inhibitor receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the molecules of the class I main hestocompatibility complex.
Moreover, the high levels of active oxygen produced by high metabolic activity of bats can suppress the coronavirus replication, simultaneously influencing the reading of exorbonuclease, thus creating a screening pressure to generate strains of the virus that, when introduced into a new host, are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic strains of the coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the host.
So it's no coincidence that in the last 20 years, three new human coronaviruses have emerged.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause slight symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They are confidently replicating without causing a strong immune response from the host.
That is the secret to why we see unsymptomous carriers and what causes severe human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly related to hyper-activation of immune response and cytokinic storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung injury.
On the contrary, the immune response of unsymptom carriers does not involve a replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of immune response failure can have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, the adoption of type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2, should have a beneficial effect on humans.
In addition, in bats, the activation of NLRP3-inflamsoma has been disrupted.
Based on this, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammsoma using MCC950 may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern in which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While betacoronavirus of bats was found, whose nucleotide homology is 95% the same as SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of bats, whose nucleotide homology is 96% the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that civites and other animals in markets carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate media were installed for SARS-CoV-2.
Betacoronaviruses of pangoline, strikingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, have been detected, suggesting that pangolines could have served as an intermediate carrier, or that fragments of betacoronavirus genes of pangolines could have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by man.
Coronaviruses have attracted global attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonic origin and HCoV reserve animals in human transmission.
Valuable evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and were passed on to humans through intermediate carriers.
If the SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and civilizations in markets, the closure and destruction of game markets in these markets could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of various lines of betacoronaviruses of pangolines close to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from the food markets to prevent zoonic transmission.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals, and how this may remain a challenge for future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single camels.
These camels are an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the proliferation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop periodic outbreaks of MERs, an integrated approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infectious control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge that cause outbreaks of disease.
There are a variety of zoonotic coronaviruses circulating around the world.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonic potential are extremely diverse.
There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotous coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and/or more deadly to humans.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, a culture of animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned.
After severe trials such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, there is a need for better preparedness and a plan to respond to such situations.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until the possibility of seizing new territories arises.
While many of the properties of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, teaching people to stay away from them can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
A better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers requires constant epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing the transfer of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of zoonotic viruses.
Some fragments are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats have passed the SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolines share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is the true intermediate, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it be a bat, a pangoline, or another mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified in their natural media.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolution path SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for “suspect cases” and “confirmed cases” COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our group published a brief guide to the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides us with lessons learned and well-established recommendations to combat the pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspect cases” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Treatment for COVID-19” (the seventh version) issued by the PRC National Health Committee.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially known as coronavirus infection of 2019 (COVID-19), erupted, and the virus itself was called “heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO defined COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a short reference guide and published it on the Internet on the website of the Military Medical Research magazine on 6 February 2020.
This publication has attracted great attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven issues of the "Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapeutics for COVID-19", published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), were published, and some of its provisions changed significantly.
Recently, Zhou ' s work with the co-sponsors commented on our recommendations, which contained simple diagnostic proposals based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on this pandemic that has spread throughout the world.
We reaffirm the high value of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapeutics for COVID-19 (pilot version 7) and ongoing research, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of this document (March 3, 2020), in order to carry out a comprehensive analysis of a case of suspected illness, one element of the epidemiological history must be combined with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movements or residences in and around Wuhan or other localities where cases of COVID-19 were reported within 14 days of symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Mr. Wuhan and its surroundings or other localities where cases of COVID-19 were reported during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms recorded within 2 weeks in small areas such as home or apartment, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external infections of COVID-19; (3) total white blood cells are normal or reduced with reduced lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on suspicion of a disease with one of the following points of pathogenic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genomic sequencing of the virus shows a high homogeneity with respect to new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies IgM and IgG; or a change in the test result from negative to negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies of IgG, or an increase in titra at least four times in the recovery phase relative to the relevant acute phase indicator.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of the said document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in airways or blood samples was added.
The pathogenic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions, followed by the need for serological evidence in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on continuous work by researchers to find an optimal set for nucleic acid detection in rapid diagnosis, as well as for analysis of respiratory samples, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and facilitates the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the validation criteria.
However, there is growing evidence of the need to exercise caution in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without visible symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented by Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies persons without clinical symptoms as a “low-risk” group.
The assessment system also needs to be clarified in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspect cases” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in the countries in which they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the daily maximum.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths a day.
That's the highest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Disease Epidemiology, Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases were reported, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Mirjaby Sabrina Flora, said that four men and one woman had been victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the dead were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60 years of age, and one was between 41 and 50.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic informed the local news agency Anadolu that Jalal Sayfur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, was one of the dead and was being treated at the Kuwaiti Matri clinic.
On Saturday, on an online video statement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Kwader, announced that public transport would be discontinued for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport was stopped from 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transportation of essential goods — medicine, fuel and food — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March for two people who had returned from Italy, as well as for the wife of one of them.
As of 19 March, the three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed a millionth of global infections.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of coronavirus infections by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 people were killed by the Coronavirus of COVID-19.
The turn came on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first coronavirus death was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries that had not recorded coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization had reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours preceding 10:00 Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
More than 244,000 coronavirus cases were reported in the United States, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that there were more than 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced stronger measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the isolation of the citizens of the city until 1 May.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians throughout the country, despite their isolation, would be paid until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of an extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; voting results: 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas the curfew had previously lasted only from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
The state governor of Ohio, Mike Dewayne, announced that the state's domestic isolation regime had been extended by order until 1 May.
Stores in Australia limit the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian networks of Wolworths and Coles have reduced the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time in all stores in the country to two and one respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions have been reported in cashier announcements as well as on the Facebook page.
Citizens are reported to have started making emergency stocks because of fears that COVID-19 might lead to a general self-imposed regime.
On Wednesday, Wolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Previously, on March 4 and 5 respectively, Wolworths and Coles had already limited this quantity to four packages.
Coles’s shopping network reported in a press release on 8 March that, with the imposition of a four-pack restriction, “toilet paper is still being bought too quickly in many stores, one shipment within an hour” and called it “unprecedented”, while ALDI’s Facebook post on Tuesday described this trend as “unexpected.”
According to the representative of Wolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco's store in Canberra last week also limited this number to two packages.
To fill the deficit, Coles ordered larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made stocks for a special early sale stock on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Ritellers Association, reported that the retakers were trying to resupply, but that was made difficult by local authorities ' restrictions on truck schedules.
It expects higher product costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, but fewer and less profitable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to stock depletion, some stores could not hold shares on Wednesdays.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that shops replenished their stores every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky commodity, so there was little storage stock and, after the sale of the whole volume of the goods, the long rows of shelves remained empty, increasing the sense of stock shortages.
“Coles and Wolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and products such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectors could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers probably wouldn’t panic so much,” says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Who Givens a Crap, reported the end of stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a toilet paper company, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent products, reported that they were operating 24 hours a day to ensure sufficient quantities of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne fell due to the absence of buyers during the week of Labour Day, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first auctioners.
The Thursday issue of NT News, published in Darwin, included an eight-page tab for cutting and toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's report of 3 March, shops were initially reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, claiming that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, halantery, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to 12 rolls.
World Health Organization proclaims the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of coVID-19 infection caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term “pandemic” refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to take action:
“All countries together are still able to influence the progress of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate, monitor and mobilize their citizens.” Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus, Director-General of WHO, explained.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming prevalence and seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Freeden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than influenza has been tracked from its inception to continued global distribution”.
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international importance and then gave it a new status, the pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, said about the outbreak: “This is just the beginning, it will get worse.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The coronavirus pandemic of 2019–2020 is the current coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome –2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and the international public health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020 and subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The death rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from the first symptom to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
Basic treatment is symptomatic and supportive: recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth with cough, observing the distance between people, identifying and ensuring the isolation of people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as a widespread shortage of goods exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of students worldwide.
Disinformation about the virus has begun to spread on the Internet, and there have been instances of xenophobia and discrimination against citizens of China, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people who resemble them externally, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where the spread of the virus has been significant.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased as a result of reduced travel and closure of heavy industries.
On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Infections were mainly related to the Juanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to be of zoonous origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently discovered virus with a large resemblance to bat coronavirus, pangoline coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, the South China branch of the Morning Post, whose information was not verified, suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that new infections in China had declined, but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that new infections outside China had for the first time exceeded new infections in China itself.
The incidence of the disease can be significantly underestimated, in particular because of the many cases with weak symptoms.
By 26 February, there had been relatively few cases of infection among young people, with patients under 19 years of age and younger accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of the world ' s cases, and the United Kingdom ' s Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallans, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity had been established.
The statistics include cases of contamination of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose test was positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had adopted a formal policy requiring that only minor symptoms should not be tested.
A study published on 16 March showed that 86% of cases of COVID-19 were not detected in China before 23 January, and that such unregistered patients had become the source of contamination for 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infection (R0) in COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this figure could be 5.7.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 are recovering safely.
In other, more complex cases, the time between the onset of symptoms and the time of death ranged from 6 to 41 days, the most frequent being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of those killed had associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes; official data on deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include deaths of patients with positive COVID tests performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not include those who have not been tested — for example, in the case of deaths at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID figures four to five times.
The spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: “We know that the [declared number of deaths] is lower than the actual number.” His words are corroborated by reports of some isolated cases in the US; such incomplete accounting is often found in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 porcine influenza epidemic; the first confirmed death was recorded in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded in the Philippines on 1 February and outside Asia in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary from region to region and time of disease; they are also affected by levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatments used, the time since the outbreak of the disease, and population parameters such as age, gender and general health status. The mortality/invalidity ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed during a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97,039/1,617,204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality to morbidity ratio decreased from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include determining the percentage of deaths due to illness (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients who die of the disease and the percentage of deaths due to infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the performance of certain population groups from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
According to the Centre for Evidence Medicine of Oxford University, the death rate from the pandemic is generally between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with the statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash cannot be defined and may vary according to location.
Macei Boni, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to go to the plateau, and then, when the number of available carriers ends, they begin to go out.
In the current situation, however, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.”
Jun Nanshan, Senior Medical Adviser to the Chinese Government, claims that “everything can end by June” if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will circulate, perhaps for a year or two.
According to a study led by Neil Ferguson's Imperial College, “until a vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) is produced, physical distance and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a member of Vanderbilt University, says, "I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear at all because it's so easily transmitted," and that it "can turn into a seasonal disease, sparking every year."
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecific, and some infected people may be able to endure the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are high temperatures (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetness in the respiratory tract (spill), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headaches, chills, vomiting, haemorrhaging, diarrhoea or cyanosis, WHO claims to be seriously ill with the development of respiratory problems of about one in six people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms such as respiratory difficulties, constant pain or chest depression, sudden sensations of confusion of consciousness, difficulty in awakening, and blueness of the face or lips. If these symptoms are present, you should immediately seek medical attention. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may experience the disease unsymptomically, without any clinical symptoms, but the results of the tests confirm the infection, so doctors recommend that those who are in close contact with confirmed patients be placed under strict control and tested for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the incidence of unsymptomous disease varies from a few to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it is usually five days, so far it is not fully clear about the odor loss symptom: the initial estimate of COVID-19 patients who developed the symptom was 30 per cent, and then dropped to 15 per cent.
Some details of how the disease is spreading are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air with cough, sneezing or conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, when coughed open, drops can spread from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
There are suggestions that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops released into the air during conversation, which can stay in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory drops can also be formed during exhalation, including during conversation, although the virus is usually not transported by air.
The drops can hit the mouth or nose of people nearby, as well as the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (CPR), may lead to exhalation products being sprayed and hence to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of a fecal oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread can occur both before the onset of symptoms and at later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where tests have been positive in the three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that the virus can be transmitted before the symptoms are pronounced.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of unsymptomous disease, but contact tracing studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from nonsymptom carriers.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that it is still unclear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infected 2 or 3 other people, and that the virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304), the virus could live for up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day and on copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, and in domestic and other animals a positive result was obtained for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as they do after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group of acute respiratory diseases reported in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur naturally in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by domestic soap that dissolves its containment. SARS-CoV-2 has a large resemblance to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to be of zoonic origin.
A genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with Betacoronavirus, a sub-nature of Sarbecovirus (cell line B), along with two other strains of bat viruses.
At a holistic-genome level, it is 96% identical to other samples of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangoline viruses and humans.
A whole-genome comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92 per cent) exists between pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolines are intermediate owners of the virus.
Virus contamination can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this is ultimately to be confirmed by a polymerazic chain reaction analysis with reverse transcription (PT-PRC) of an infected secret or a CT scan.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that the CT was much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions were similar to other pneumonias and disease currents.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line diagnostic test method for COVID-19”.
WHO published several RNA test protocols on SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymerysis chain reaction (PT-PRC) is being tested.
It may be carried out on respiratory samples and blood samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
A nosed swab is usually used for the test, although a yawn swab can also be used, and a number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them had proved accurate enough to obtain approval for universal application.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Sellex was approved for use in emergency cases only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic features of the visualization of symptoms on X-rays and CTs are asymmetrical peripheral muzzles of the type of matt glass and the absence of pleural excreta.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for compiling an international database of confirmed cases of contamination.
Because of similarity to other infections, such as adenowyrus, when identifying COVID-19, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical features.
In China, a major study comparing the results of the thorax CT and PCR testing was carried out, and it was found that although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be deciphered more quickly; they were also more sensitive and therefore the diagnostic method could be considered as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
In order to diagnose the virus using X-rays and CT scans, synthetic neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding eye contact, nose or mouth with dirty hands, and using coughing or sneezing napkins that should be thrown out immediately after use.
Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance ourselves from people, and many Governments recommend refraining from any non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus has been able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus spreads to the population, some members of whom do not know where or how they have been infected; it is recommended that health-care providers who care for patients who may be infected use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with other people and eye protection; and it is also an important method used by the health authorities to determine the source of the infection and to prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements demanding that this type of surveillance be limited.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use were developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working to develop solutions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data — for example, recording the user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test has been positive, he is notified, and there are unfounded versions of how to prevent infection — for example, nose and mouth striations, which are not effective.
So far, there is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on it.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with heavy hand contamination, and before eating, after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens up its protective sheath.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants with alcohol content of at least 60%.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with a number of solutions (on the stainless steel surface, the disinfectant begins to operate a minute after application) with 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% powdone yoda.
Other components, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorogexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of suspicion of COVID or its confirmation in an institution such as an office or day-care facility, all spaces in such a space, including offices, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, should be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that coughing or sneezing cover the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or napkin and immediately throw away the hygiene items used.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to use medical masks, as mask use can limit the volume and range of exhalation products that are dispersed in the air during conversation, sneeze and cough.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, and touching a face with dirty hands is the main means of infection.” Masks are also recommended for use by those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of the mask does reduce the number of facial contact.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC centers, USA, recommend wearing non-medical masks, China specifically stressed the importance of using one-time medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with other people.
It is recommended that Hong Kong wear a medical mask in public transport or public places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make and wash face masks at home on a daily basis.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going out without masks covering their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government has instructed all visitors to grocery stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks have been produced per day since mid-March, medical masks have been prescribed for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were required to wear a medical mask while going out to the street; those who could not buy masks were advised to make them themselves at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an anti-infection measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding public places, using uncontacted greetings and physically distance from others.
Many Governments in the regions particularly affected by the outbreak now prescribe or recommend social distance.
The maximum number of people who can gather in one place, as recommended by the U.S. government and health organizations, has been rapidly reduced from 250 (in regions where COVID-19 was not available) to 50, and later to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the grouping of more than two persons. Older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and weakened immune system face an increased risk of contracting the virus in serious form. CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak of disease in the region. In late March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term “social distance” with “physical distance” so specifying the purpose of this measure to reduce physical contact within the framework of social relationships, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be socially excluded instead of remaining in contact with other people in alternative ways; some agencies had published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, recommendations have been made to have sex only with your permanent partners with whom you live and who you believe he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are advised to be self-insulating in the home.
Health facilities have issued detailed instructions on proper self-immunization, and many Governments have also made mandatory or recommended that all populations in affected areas be quarantined themselves.
Those at high risk were given the strictest quarantine.
Persons who may have been in contact with those infected with COVID-19 or who have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic have been advised to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Flash control strategies include containment, control or mitigation of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease takes place at an early stage and is designed to track and isolate the infected, as well as other infectious control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a stage when the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are being directed towards mitigation: actions are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health systems and society.
Measures to control and mitigate the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
Compression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, reducing the baseline number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of an infectious disease is aimed at reducing the epidemic ' s peak known as the equalization of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, medical masks and self-immunization; community-based measures aimed at physical distance, such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community involvement in and facilitation of such measures; and environmental protection measures, such as surface clean-up, since the seriousness of the outbreak became apparent in China, stronger actions have been taken to contain the outbreak, such as the isolation of entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries have also adopted a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as an alert system for the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected persons in isolation and heavy fines were imposed on those who failed to do so.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has been increased and fines have been imposed for the accumulation of excess stocks of medicines, and the British and U.S. simulations have shown that there are serious problems in terms of mitigation (delaying but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the epidemic).
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the peak health burden by 2/3 and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Pressure may be the preferred method, but it needs to be used as long as the virus circulates to the population (or until the vaccine is developed, if sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will resume rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic results in social and economic costs.
Antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19 do not exist at this time, but efforts are under way to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
The use of cold-free medications, sufficient fluids, and rest can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only hurt.
Several compounds previously approved for other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and household goods” can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and adaptation of health care to patients with COVID-19 as the primary response to an outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health-care services to facilitate the reallocation of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the elimination of non-urgent procedures where possible, the detection of the virus and the isolation of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as the expansion of intensive care through training of staff and the expansion of the availability of IVL and beds.
There are different theories as to where the very first case of infection could have occurred — the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of new coronavirus infection probably occurred on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
During the month, the incidence of coronavirus in Hubei province increased gradually.
They were mainly related to the Juanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one of the theories is that the virus has entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus is of zoonous origin. On 26 December, the Hubei Clinic reported a case of massive pneumonia of unknown origin to a physician, Zhang Tianjin, who reported the case to the Jianghang Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan City on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the central clinic in Wuhan warned their colleagues of a “coronavirus similar to SARS.”
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlan, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumours, and the doctor, Ay Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for causing panic.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission published a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.
The Uhan health authorities reported cases of unknown pneumonia, which were large enough to initiate an investigation in early January; in the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by China's New Year's celebrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two people who fell ill in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already had symptoms of the disease; as at 26 March, the United States had surpassed China and Italy in the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide; as at 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of contamination.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted their freedom of movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory stay at home, mandatory shelter or isolation), as well as curfews; as at 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in some form of quarantine; more than 50 million people were isolated in the Philippines; about 59 million were in isolation in South Africa; and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure increased to 2.6 billion, about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, which was not verified, the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Jang Jisian was working on a case of massive pneumonia of unknown type, which her clinic notified the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan City on 27 December.
Primary genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 revealed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission published a public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In response to such notifications, the police warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for “dissemination of rumours” about the outbreak.
Originally, the Chinese National Health Commission argued that there was no “clear evidence” of the ability of the newly discovered virus to transmit from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, later called Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping “people’s war.”
The “largest quarantine in the history of mankind” began to unfold, and on 23 January the cordon was declared sanitary and the ban on entry into and return to Wuhan, and later extended to a total of 15 cities in the province of Hubei, affecting a total of some 57 million people.
They banned the use of private transport in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled in many places (25 January).
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary Khushenshan hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishengshan, was built to receive other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly constructed hospitals, China has also reassigned 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions were imposed in Hubei province and abroad.
Public transport schedules have been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, a regime for controlling the movement of citizens has been introduced and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) have experienced some form of restriction of movement in the open air, and since the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, a 14-day compulsory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international travellers entering the city; as of 23 March, only one case of internal transmission had been recorded in mainland China, five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of internal transmission had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On the same day, travel restrictions to Hubei other than Wuhan were lifted, two months after the closure of the province. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry for visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March.
Those wishing to come to China would have to apply for a visa from Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on businesses and factories to resume their work and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On 4 April, at 10 a.m., a national three-minute “minute silence” was held, opening a day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus declared by the National Council of State and coinciding with Queenmin, but the central Government asked citizens to pay tribute to the victims online, respecting physical distance, in order to avoid a recurrence of the COVID-19 outbreak.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji in Tegu.
Shinchongji's followers came to Tegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, out of 9,336 church members, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) had reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea had the highest level of anxiety.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were recorded in Korea, and as of 29 February that number had risen to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers were tested to have a virus.
The outbreak has affected the number of trips, hence the change in flight schedules, and South Korea has launched a programme to screen the population for the presence of the virus, track contacts and arrange quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered to be the largest and best of its organization worldwide.
Screening methods included mandatory notification of symptoms through a mobile application by all those coming from abroad, extensive testing for the virus, which was ready the following day, and increased testing opportunities, which allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea’s program is considered successful in dealing with the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that entire cities have not been isolated there, and that originally South Korea’s society was divided because of President Moon Jae-in’s reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for impeachment of Mr. Moon for what they considered to be the Government ' s inadequate response to the outbreak.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of infections in one day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed in a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on 1 April South Korea requested assistance in testing 121 countries for the virus.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers and the closure of universities, institutions of higher education and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to restrict intercity travel were announced in March, but intensive city-to-city movement continued before the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrines in Kum remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020, and Iran became the centre of the virus after China in February.
Against the backdrop of allegations of concealment of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February more than 10 countries had linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the scale of the outbreak there could be more serious than the 388 recorded by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members reportedly had positive results on the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch (Human Rights Watch) called on the Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as to release temporarily all eligible prisoners.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronavirus had been recorded every hour in Iran and one new death by coronavirus every 10 minutes.
According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran could be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
It is also suggested that US sanctions against Iran may affect the country’s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded the easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had entered Italian territory when two Chinese tourists had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome and had had a positive result.
The number of cases has increased rapidly, prompting the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, by which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “The entry into and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as 100 deaths had already been recorded in Italy at that time.
All major sports events, including the A-series football matches, were scheduled to take place behind closed doors until April, but all sports events were postponed by at least one month on 9 March.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for prioritizing patients ' medical care, which may need to be used.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China in terms of mortality from the coronavirus, ranking first in the world, following the announcement of 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed coronavirus infections, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovery cases in Italy, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardia region.
A CNN report notes that a combination of two factors can contribute to this high mortality rate in Italy: the large number of elderly citizens in that country and the lack of access to the examination of all those currently suffering from coronavirus.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus with the calmest response of all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020 the British Government did not impose any form of social dispersal or quarantine measures on citizens.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not reacting quickly enough and seriously to the dangers faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that no travel and social contacts of low priority should be undertaken, offering people to work from home whenever possible and to avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than £2,500 per month, as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter measures for social distance, prohibiting more than two people from gathering and limiting travel and outdoor recreation to cases of extreme need.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by the police, fines and crowds.
Most businesses were ordered to close down, with the exception of those that provide “viability”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages.
On 20 January, in the Pacific Northwest State of Washington, a man who returned from Wuhan on 15 January was confirmed to have the first COVID-19 case in the country.
On 29 January, a Coronavirus Task Force was established in the White House.
On 31 January, the Trump administration declared a state of emergency in the public health sector and imposed entry restrictions on visitors from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, a leading public health organization of the U.S. Government, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Nevertheless, the testing of the population in the United States was not initiated immediately and the true scale of the disease during this period was concealed.
Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the lack of federal government authorization by the end of February to use non-State test kits developed by academic organizations, various companies and clinics, and restrictive criteria until early March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done by appointment of a doctor).
The Washington Post reported that by 27 February, fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted by 13 March.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: “Many patients, even with symptoms and appointments, were waiting hours or days to be tested.” After the first coronavirus death in the United States was reported from Washington State on February 29, Governor Jay Insley declared a state of emergency, which was also soon announced by other states.
In Seattle schools, classes were cancelled on 3 March, and by mid-March schools were closed throughout the country. On 6 March 2020, a group of epidemiologists from Imperial College, London, informed the United States about the predictions of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Additional Funding for Preparedness and Response to the Coronavirus Act, under which emergency assistance of $8.3 billion was provided to the federal authorities to respond to the outbreak.
Corporations imposed travel restrictions on staff, cancelled conferences and encouraged staff to work from home.
Sports events and seasons were cancelled. On 11 March, Trump announced travel restrictions to most of Europe, with the exception of Britain, for 30 days starting on 13 March.
The following day, he extended the restrictions to include Great Britain and Ireland.
On 13 March, the President declared a state of emergency in the country, which made it possible to use federal means to deal with the crisis.
Since March 15, many companies have been closing or reducing hours of work throughout the United States, helping to combat the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On 23 March, it was reported that 10,700 cases per day had been reported in New York, exceeding the total number of cases in South Korea.
On 25 March, the Governor said that social distance was probably an effective measure, as estimates of doubling the number of cases had fallen from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As at 28 March, 32,308 cases had been registered in New York and 672 persons had died. On 26 March, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy.
According to media reports dated 30 March, President Trump decided to extend the period of social distance until 30 April.
On the same day, a USNS Comfort hospital ship docked at the port of New York City for 1,000 beds.
On April 3, 884 coronavirus deaths were recorded in the United States within 24 hours.
In New York State, as of 3 April, the number of cases exceeded 100,000, and the White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring publicly available information by monitoring public statements and publications related to the virus by Vice-President Mike Pens's office.
On the whole, the supporters of President Trump have divided their views on how well he is coping with the crisis.
Some officials and commentators have criticized US dependence on imports of essential materials, including basic necessities, from China.
In mid-January 2020, Travel Medicine published an analysis of air travel patterns, which was used to map and predict the spread of the disease.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association in 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of travellers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist destinations, Bali was considered to be the least prepared for an outbreak, while Australian cities were considered to be the most prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted its new coronavirus emergency plan (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is stated that much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will focus on border control and threat communication.
On 21 March, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.
Thanks to effective quarantine measures in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries had planned to evacuate their nationals and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights from their home countries, to which the Chinese authorities had authorized them.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan to evacuate their nationals.
Pakistan stated that it did not intend to evacuate citizens from China.
On 7 February, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilian/Brazilian relatives, as well as four Poles, a Chinese and an Indian citizen.

On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate U.S. nationals aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
On 21 February, an aircraft with 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian Government began to evacuate its nationals from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways aircraft chartered by the Government of South Africa flew with 112 South African nationals on board.
A medical check-up of passengers was carried out prior to the flight, and four South Africans who had been found to show signs of coronavirus were left in China to mitigate the risk.
Only South Africans with negative tests on the coronavirus were evacuated.
The analyses were taken from all South African citizens, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and they remained under surveillance as a precautionary measure and were quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.
On 20 March, the United States began to withdraw partially from Iraq in response to the pandemic.

Some Chinese students studying at American universities have come together to gather and send aid to regions affected by the virus in China, and a group from Chicago reportedly sent 50,000 N95 respirators to Hubei clinics on 30 January. Direct Relief, together with FedEx, sent 200,000 medical masks to the Wuhana Union clinic by 30 January, as well as other personal protective equipment, including gloves and robes.
On 5 February, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to WHO to fund vaccine development and the treatment of the coronavirus, as well as to protect populations at risk in Africa and South Asia from the threat of the virus.

Japan had also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey had sent medical equipment there, Russia had provided more than 13 tons of medicines, Malaysia had pledged 18 million medical gloves, Germany had sent various medical supplies, including 10,000 protective kits, the United States had donated 17.8 tons of medicines, and had pledged $100 million in financial support to the affected countries.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the organization to distribute them to its member States.
Later, he also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks and 5 IVL machines to Panama.
The Czech Republic, Georgia, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey expressed concern about medical masks and test kits for Chinese production.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits, which ensured accuracy of up to 30 per cent, while the Netherlands withdrew 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also withdrew 100,000 unusable medical masks, which were supposed to have been manufactured in China, but subsequently turned out to be from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of infection.
WHO noted clear differences between the outbreak of SARS in 2002-2004, in which allegations of classified information were made against the Chinese authorities, which allegedly prevented the prevention and control of the disease on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government “received regular updates on the situation to avoid panic on the eve of China’s New Year.”
On 23 January, in response to a decision by the central authorities to impose a travel ban on Wuhan, the WHO representative, Goden Galea, noted that, although “this measure was definitely not recommended by WHO”, it was also “a very important demonstration of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the most common location” and described it as “unprecedented in public health history”. On 30 January, after confirming the ability of infection to be transmitted from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of people infected in other countries, WHO declared a public health emergency of international importance (PHEIC); this situation became the sixth since 2009, when it was first introduced during the porcine influenza pandemic.
Mr. Tedros Adanham, Director-General of WHO, said that the announcement of PHEIC was due to “a global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries lacking reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to provide $675 million for strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, highlighting the need to provide urgent assistance to those countries that “have no systems in place to identify people infected by the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “our readiness is the degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest link”, and called on the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay in the future.” At a press conference on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide “the capacity of the entire UN system in response to the problem.”
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group was established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO states, will “focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to deal with the outbreak from a broader social and economic perspective”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc group to work with international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in resolving the domestic situation and to assess “the seriousness of the disease and its contamination”, organized seminars and meetings with key national institutions, and field visits to assess “the effectiveness of the response at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas.” On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of coronavirus, noting that “it is too early to call the pandemic, but countries must nevertheless be prepared to do so”.
When the outbreak erupted in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the probability of the global spread of the coronavirus would be increased from “high” to “very high” — the highest degree of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO health emergency programme, warned in his statement: “It is a test of every government on the planet to be ready for reality: the time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared, and it also stressed that the right response can help the world avoid the “worst scenario.”
Ryan also stated that current data did not justify the proclamation of a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that the declaration of a pandemic would mean that “we essentially recognize the fact that everyone on the planet would be at risk of contracting the virus”.
On 11 March, WHO launched a pandemic coronavirus.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO was “deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on the issue.” WHO has been seriously criticized for its perceived inadequate approach to the notion of pandemic, including the late announcement of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as pandemics.
In response to the situation, a petition was filed against Mr. Tedros Adanham, Director-General of WHO, inviting him to resign, which had been signed by 733,000 persons as of 6 April.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to life-saving measures and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unidentified groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the crisis associated with COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide views and recommendations.
The digital hub provides information on the policies of different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, eliminate quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gow and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for taking action against the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) provincial level were dismissed for their quarantine measures in central China, and these dismissals indicated dissatisfaction with the response of the political establishment to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak had started in Wuhan, but took sides with the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had originated in the United States or Italy.
US President Donald Trump’s administration called the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Uhana virus”, stating that “censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of a virus that has now become a global pandemic”, a statement that has in turn been criticized by some commentators who argue that such an approach is racist and “restraints from the US President’s inability to contain the spread of the disease.”
The Daily Best has gained access to the U.S. government telegram, which contains a communications strategic trick apparently invented by the National Security Council, with such references to strategy: “The whole thing is in China.
We have been asked to disseminate this information by any means possible, including press conferences and television broadcasts.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to help countries affected by the virus are part of a “promotional push” to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geo-political component that includes the struggle for influence through the PR and the so-called policy of generosity.”
Borrell also stated that “China has insisted on promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the US.”
China also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, reportedly sending aid to the last two countries.
The donation of 100,000 medical masks by Jack Ma to Cuba was banned in connection with the United States sanctions imposed on April 3.
The US authorities are also accused of redirecting aid destined for other countries to their own country.
There have also been disputes over medical masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IWL machines destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus in Italy.
Mauricio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said that “China was the only one that reacted bilaterally.
This is clearly not a sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for Russian military ambulances, specialized disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to be sent to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source” claiming that 80% of Russian aid was “unuseful or of little use to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on world public opinion at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
Attilio Fontana, President of Lombardia, and Luigi Di Mayo, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, rejected the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that “in offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase their pace of production, they will also be able to respond when needed.”
NATO's Protector 2020 military exercises, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the cold war — will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized Defender 2020 (Protector 2020): “In the current public health crisis, these exercises endanger not only the US military and many European participating countries, but also the inhabitants of the countries where such events are to take place.” The Iranian Government has been severely affected by the virus. Some two dozen members of Parliament have been infected, as well as fifteen other current or former politicians.
On 14 March 2020, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, in an open letter, requested assistance from world leaders, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets owing to the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran, and that the epidemic had prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies that were prevalent in other affluent countries, including the introduction of a unified health and childcare system, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Political scientists expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election, and the pandemic has worsened diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea criticized Japan’s “unclear and passive quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any citizen from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine in a government-designated location.
South Korean society was originally divided because of President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for impeachment of Mr. Moon for what they considered to be the Government ' s inadequate response to the outbreak of disease; the pandemic forced countries to enact emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their authority.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orban the indefinite right to rule by decree, suspend the work of Parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fake information about the virus and government responses to the crisis.
The outbreak of the coronavirus was cited as causing several shortfalls in supply owing to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods under conditions of panic, and the disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Panic purchases have also occurred in several locations, leading to the disappearance of essential commodities such as food, toilet paper and bottled water from the shelf of shops, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanam, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This surge has resulted in a 20-fold increase in prices over the normal price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It has also caused a lack of personal protection equipment worldwide, and WHO has warned that health workers will be affected for this reason.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, daigow buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities have resulted in a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and have subsequently been banned by the Australian Government, despite the high incidence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, both areas have been spared from severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illegal trade in critical products, which had proved successful, had avoided the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
North Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but the industry believes that agricultural prices may rise.
The shelves of the food shops remained empty only temporarily, even in the town of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to ensure adequate food for the population.
Italy also has similar laws requiring food producers to conserve food supplies in case of emergency.
The damage to the world economy affected China: according to media reports of 16 March, China’s economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to combat the spread of the virus, which resulted in a 20.5 per cent reduction in retail sales.
Mainland China is a major economic and production centre; therefore, the virus outbreak is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agatha Demaray, a member of the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that market volatility will continue until there is a clearer picture of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could exceed that of the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004.
According to an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis, damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and negative impacts could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have taken “urgent measures” following a sharp decline in oil prices due to the fall in Chinese demand.
On 24 February, world stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected by COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing fears of a coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and Dow Jones's index for industrial equity, showed the sharpest decline since 2008, with Dow's index falling by 1,191 points, the largest one-day fall since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed a decline of more than 10 per cent.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The stock fell again because of concerns about the distribution of the coronavirus, and the biggest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a possibility of economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks are reacting faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, closures of public places, including tourist attractions, and recommendations by Governments not to undertake any travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights owing to a sharp decline in the demand for airline tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has never been stronger.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of China's New Year's celebrations.
A number of large-scale events, including annual New Year festivals, were cancelled by national and regional Governments; private companies also closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.
Many New Year's events had been cancelled and tourist attractions had been closed to prevent mass gatherings of people; for example, Beijing had closed the Forbidden City and had abolished traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China ' s 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, the authorities extended the New Year ' s recess until 10 February, directing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling the New Year’s celebrations; the retail sector has been affected globally: shop hours have been shortened and some shops have been temporarily closed.
Attendance at retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March, attendance at malls fell by 33 to 43 per cent compared to February.
Trade point operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of visiting temperature testing equipment and cancellation of activities; according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million more people out of poverty than would have been the case, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, some 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were found at home in their provinces or locked up in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the Government for help.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, an outbreak of coronavirus could deprive 47 million people of their jobs, and unemployment could reach 32 per cent; self-immunization measures imposed in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers in receipt of daily wages unemployed; a study by the Angus Reid Institute had shown that 44 per cent of Canadian households had experienced unemployment in one way or another; nearly 900,000 Spanish workers had also lost jobs since the imposition of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit. Almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their employees to government-subsidized reduced working hours, part-time.
The German part-time wage scheme was also introduced in France and Great Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage were also severely affected by the pandemic, which affected organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, worldwide.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often State-funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, supporting the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed indefinitely around the world, or access to them had been restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances had been cancelled or rescheduled.
Other recent and growing effects of the virus are the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered disruptions, and the Vatican announced the cancellation of the Good Week events in Rome during the last week of the Christian penitentiaries, the Great Post.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live or television, while some church leaders offer open - air services.
The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome has closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter’s Square, where Christian pilgrims are no longer appearing, and later other religious organizations have also abolished worship and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourdes.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its own residents from accessing the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since the Second World War.
Most major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA League of Champions 2019-20, the Premier League 2019-20, the Euro 2020 UEFA, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The coronavirus outbreak also destroyed plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were due to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “post-2020, but no later than summer 2021.” Casinos and other gaming institutions around the world were closed down, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either postponed or cancelled.
This has resulted in many players becoming online and many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in the number of new subscribers.The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, have also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results over the Internet, organizing live webcasts or web festivals; this helps artists to continue to produce, produce or publish their works.
There are many Internet memes on the subject of coronavirus, many of which are humorous and reduce the anxiety surrounding periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as against the populations of hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
The February information reports (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) recorded racist attitudes expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly earned the virus or received fair retribution for something.
Anti-Chinese sentiment is also rising in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those living in virus-affected areas, were supported both offline and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, particularly in Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions may also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia; citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed an early petition insisting that Chinese citizens should not enter their countries to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (# Chinese Non-Come to Japan) held leading positions on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report a growing level of racist sentiment and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus"; critics consider this to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Uhan to the New Sanjars.
Students coming from north-eastern India bordering China and studying in major cities in India reported persecutions associated with a coronavirus outbreak.
Dileep Ghosh, President of the State Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, West Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “for that reason God took revenge on them.”
These remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them “misleading.” In China, the pandemic has re-emerged xenophobia and racism against non-Chineses, calling foreigners “foreign garbage” and objects subject to “recycling”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles on the coronavirus outbreak publicly available.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their research on preprint publishing servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is only designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
Antibodies detection (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.
Antibodies tests reveal the number of people who have suffered the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated by the hospital or who were not present at all.
The exact death rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined from the results of the test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries was very mixed.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries can be greatly exaggerated.
With a polymerazic chain reaction to real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory tract samples obtained in various ways, including a nostril swab or a wet sample.
The results are usually available for a period of between a few hours and two days.
The OT-PCR test performed on swabs taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from its throat, but it may continue to reproduce in its lungs.
Infected patients tested in the second week of the disease may alternatively take material from the lower respiratory tract with a suction catheter, or use sugaring products (mock).
One of the early tests of the PCR was developed at the Charité Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymerazic chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis for 250,000 sets that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, Kogenebiotech, a South Korean company, developed a clinical-level SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It identifies the gene "E", common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the gene RdRp specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain permission from China's National Drug Administration for the emergency use of the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing through the International Regent Resource a diagnostic panel for RT-PRC in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test sets was incomplete because of defective reagents and a narrow test area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was only after that date that public and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Authority as part of an emergency use permit, and the US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 contamination based on the RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing on COVID-19 throughout the country on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been declared; the extraction and processing of analyses must be in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Research Centre for Virusology and Biotechnology “VECTOR”.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service, and it was reported that on 12 March 2020 the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect the infection of COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for a test, which can be performed for 3.5 hours on a large sample, allowing one car to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application permit (EUA) to Abbott laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; previously the FDA issued a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Hepheid also received the UUA from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA also approved a test using the amplification of insulated nucleic acids instead of the PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of consecutive temperature cycles, it can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is currently developing a monoclonal antibody test that is specifically linked to the new coronavirus (N-Black), and there is hope that results will be available in 15 to 20 minutes, like a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that “the thorax X-rays have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, whereas the CT [computer tomography] results may have such value even before symptoms appear”.
Typical topics identified during the CT include two-way long subpleural compaction tricks of the "mat glass" type with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution.
Subpleural domination, a symptom of a rock bridge, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that the CT was much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions overlapped with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line diagnostic test method for COVID-19.” As of March 2020, CDC has recommended the use of the PCR method for initial screening.
The partial immune response to the infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after day 7, to determine immunity and to perform population control.
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed at which each system is produced.
CLT usually uses one sample of peripheral blood, although serial samples may be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by perforating the skin.
Unlike the PCR methods, the blood extraction phase is not required for sampling. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have completed all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to distribute their antibodies tests.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA had approved only one emergency application test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were granted European permits to use their test kits, which can be detected in blood samples of IgG and IgA that have the ability to control the virus.
The test performance is several hundred samples over a few hours and therefore the method works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of the viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection, and early in April, Britain discovered that none of the antibody test kits it acquired were satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspicion of the virus to stay at home: “Emergency officers pass a sample sample sample sample tube to the patient”, the patient spits into it, gives it back and receives the test results some time later.” British NHS announced the launch of its pilot screening scheme for suspicious cases in the home, which eliminates the risk of infection by a patient of other visitors to clinics or the need to disinfect an ambulance if it was used to transport the patient.
Express testing centres helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures in any other country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Physicians stated that they were willing to perform about 12,000 outpatient tests per day, and only 10,700 tests per week had been available.
If the examination is ordered by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's total test performance is 160,000 tests a week.
As of 19 March, rapid testing had been proposed in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests taken in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study found that, as of the calendar week 12/2020, a total of 483,295 tests had been taken on SARS-CoV-2, up to and including the week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) of the results had been positive. The Israeli Technion and Rambam Hospital researchers had developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Wuhan, on 5 February 2020, BGI opened a 2,000 square metres temporary emergency detection laboratory called “Ho-Yan” (in Chinese or “Fire Eye”), which could process more than 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jiang and completed in only five days; the simulation showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher, and therefore quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
Following the opening of the laboratory in Wuhan, the Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were opened immediately in a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day, open multiplex Origami Assays, which can test up to 1,122 patient tests per COVID19 using only 93 test tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, excluding the use of robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, because of the shortage and shortage of reagents, mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom, and the United States had become problematic.
As a result, some authors have requested test sample processing protocols that provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the volume of coronavirus testing currently conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita was higher than that of any other country and that the majority of the population would soon be tested.
This was due to rapid testing opportunities, along with the acquisition of mass testing laboratories from the Group 42 and the BGI (established through their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, which has been deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PRC tests per day and is the world's first laboratory on such a large scale operating outside China.
Various testing options targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of test kits, which are sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States health centres was not available until 28 January, resulting in a lack of test kits in the United States; early outbreaks in China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient sets recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts argue, the widespread availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programmes as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many private laboratories in the United States, which received hundreds of thousands of samples, were overburdened, and stocks of swabs and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by CDC had “deficits,” and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these sets were inaccurate.
The firm explained that faulty sampling or misuse of sets could be the cause of inaccuracies.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw inaccurate-performance kits and replace them with other sets — Shenzhen Bioeasy sets. Eighty per cent of the test kits that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had produced incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovich proposed to dump them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an official of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a “high level of error” and the Ministry “did not use them.” Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was declared unsuitable for use.
Quarantine measures for those whose tests had yielded positive results at SARS-CoV-2, as well as surveillance of those with whom such patients had contact, had yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Vaud, where a COVID-19 person died for the first time in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing of the total population of about 3,400, at intervals of about 10 days.
About half of the positive people had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases had been quarantined.
The entrance to the locality was closed and this measure completely halted the spread of the infection.
With intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less intense than in other developed countries and no extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and shops had to be imposed.
Many events were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began urging residents to stay at home, but the schools that ended on 23 March opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also coped with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, but restrictions have been less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were conducted than the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because those countries were able to identify more patients with weak or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries lacking resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative test results to COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO testing laboratories for validation testing.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America, and one in Australia.
In the next graph, the percentage of positive results in the column depends on the country-specific testing policy.
A country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher percentage success than a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, other equal conditions.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is a process of cleaning up hands to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular hand-washing with soap in certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal oral means.
A person may also become infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common colds, for example, if he touches eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, followed by washing hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the buttocks of the child or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after cooking or treating raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, you can clean your hands with ash.
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the patient's care.
After changing diapers or washing up a baby who went to the bathroom.
After snorting, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, fodder or animal waste.
The medical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of handwashing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms capable of causing diseases) as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.
Handwashing is very healthy: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhoeas, reduces respiratory infections,
It also reduces the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight increase in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by absorbing simple habits such as hand-washing with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce diarrhoea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income regions.
A 48 per cent reduction in diarrhoea can be attributed to hand-washing with soap; hand-washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (ARIs), provided that habits are developed in every home, in schools and in other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of the ORI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, which takes the lives of about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia in general kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after the toilet, which has become a strong habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhea mortality by almost half, and acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also prevents the emergence of impetigo, a disease that is transmitted in direct physical contact.
A slight negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can result in skin drying and, in fact, damage to skin.
A 2012 Danish study showed that too much hand washing can lead to tooth and skin shagging – a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often, hand washing can also be considered a symptom of OCD.
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when hand-washing with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (urination, defecation), after washing the buttocks of the child (substitution of diapers), before feeding the child, before feeding the child, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where hands are to be washed to prevent transmission: before or after cutting or wound, after sneezing, coughing or shrivelling, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand-washing with soap is rather rare.
A study on handwashing conducted in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7 per cent of families had hand-washing with soap as a common practice. 2014 research showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest figure, 97 per cent; the United States was closer to mid-point, 77 per cent; China had the lowest rate, 23 per cent. There were currently several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations.
The “Emergency Care Programme” implemented by the Philippine Ministry of Education is an example of large-scale interventions to improve child health and education.
The national programme is based on deworming, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily soap-washing and daily tooth cleaning with fluorine.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove and increase solubility barriers.
Water per se is not considered effective for skin cleaning, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are poorly dissolved in water.
Adequate water, however, contributes to the process of purification.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may be reached by previous use.
A small number of studies on the impact on the skin of bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap indicate a low probability of such an impact, as bacteria wash away from foam.
The CDC still argues that “liquid soap with hand dosage is the preferred option for washing hands”.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in health care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by their nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosane, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be consistent with advertised strains.
In addition to surfactant and skin protection, complex compounds may contain acids (acetic, austrobin, milk) as a regulator of pH, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other excreta (loe faith, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that simple soap varieties are as effective in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the skin as normal antibacterial soap containing triclosane.
Hot water is still not hot enough for the human skin to kill bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold water to remove natural fats that contain contamination and bacteria.
Contrary to popular opinion, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial stress on hands.
Hand disinfectant (sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a hand-sanitizer that contains no water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand hygiene products (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectors, hand disinfectors or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these products are made of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of clotting agents such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel or humidifiers, such as liquid glycerin or foam, making the use of these agents convenient and reducing the effect of alcohol drying the skin.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity; disinfectants containing a minimum of 60-95 per cent alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multiple drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), a tuberculosis stick, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
The disinfectants, which contain 70% alcohol, kill 99.97 % bacteria (a reduction log of 3.5, similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % - 99.99% bacteria (a reduction log of 4-5) on hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against viruses of the type norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis, and sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-containing agents must be used to thoroughly process and soak the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and back surface of both hands, as well as the space between the fingers, shall be rubbed over the entire length for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is fully absorbed.
The fingertips of both arms should also be carefully washed, and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the choice be made for hand washing rather than the use of disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily polluted.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfectants is due to the ease with which they are used and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand-washing if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants can cause skin dryness if the composition does not contain softening agents and (or) skin humidifiers.
The effect of skin drying with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and (or) other mitigating agents to the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing mitigating components caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact nettle syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually non-existent.
The lower probability of irritating contact dermatitis was a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their efficiency, water - free products do not cleanse their hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic micro-organisms as conventional soap and water, since they still leave pathogenic micro-organisms in their hands.
The effectiveness of the disinfectant for non-alcohol hands depends to a large extent on components and formulations and has historically been significantly lower than for alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
More recently, it has been shown that products using benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative anti-microbial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to be ineffective after repeated use, probably due to progressive dermal reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.
Zola or clay can be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is disinfectant because it forms alkaline solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent contamination, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommend the use of hand-washing techniques, which include the following steps:
Rinse your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that run-off water, because standing water may be contaminated, but the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wash your hands with a large amount of soap, including the back of your hands, as well as the areas between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (not just water), people tend to wash their hands more carefully.
Triple your hands for at least 20 seconds.
The friction helps remove the germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs you remove.
Carefully rub your hands under the running water.
Handwashing in standing water can cause recontamination.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry themselves.
Wet and wet hands are more easily polluted, and most often people ignore areas like thumbs, wrists, and areas between fingers and nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that wetting lotion be used to prevent skin drying, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different low-cost ways of washing hands: pumping water from a hanging canister or bottled pumpkin with holes and (or) using ash, if necessary, as in developing countries; in places with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as foot pedal taps and other low-cost options.
A foot pedal crane is a simple structure consisting of a rope-mounted vessel and a foot lever, which should be pressed to pour water on the hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by a European symposium on paper napkins and towels, the subject of which was a comparison of the hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern hand dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a warm air dryer, the total amount of bacteria on the fingertips increased by an average of 194% and on the palms by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in an airflow dryer, the total amount of bacteria on the fingertips increases by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria on the fingertips decreases to an average of 76% and on the palms to 77%. Scientists have also tested to determine whether several visitors to toilet rooms and toilet environments can be cross-contaminated at each type of drying.
A jet dryer that releases air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph) can blow micro-organisms off hand and from its own block and potentially infect other users of toilets and toilets within a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads micro-organisms within a radius of 0.25 metres from the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess various methods of hand drying.
Changes in the number of bacteria, depending on the method of hand drying, are as follows:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to dryer paper towels.
Hand cleaning using disinfectant napkins can be an alternative during travels without soap and water.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant shall contain at least 60 per cent alcohol.
A medical hand-washing method became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignatz Zemmelweiss discovered its high efficiency (in 1846) in the prevention of inpatient diseases.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget to do so.
According to one study, the use of such devices does help to reduce the level of contamination.
The medical washing of the hands lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbed between each other’s fingers.
If there's dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water in their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
A paper towel should be used after drying of the hands by closing the crane and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors.
This avoids the re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The goal of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (microbes) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, correct hand-washing and other basic procedures can reduce the rate of blood flow associated with the use of catheter by 66 per cent; the World Health Organization has published a leaflet showing the standard hand-washing and treatment procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open to public discussion.
The review was co-authored by Whitby.
Commercial devices may be used for measuring performance and checking hand hygiene if compliance with regulatory requirements is required.
The World Health Organization refers to “five moments” when it is necessary to wash hands:
After contact with blood or biological fluids,
before the use of antiseptic, and
Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap in hand washing ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary prior to surgery or in environments with high levels of antibiotic resistant organisms. A tap is required for the “cleaning” of the hands before surgery, which can be turned on and off without touching the hands; and some chlorhexide or iodized water should be used for handwashing, sterile hand dryers after washing, a sterile friction brush, and another sterile instrument for cleaning under nails.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for two to six minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands for too long, like ten minutes.
During the striping, the water with the forearm should not fall back on the hands.
Once the washing is completed, the hands dry with sterile tissue and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after care.
In order to combat staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of washing was most beneficial to the hands, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of washing hands was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to washing antibacterial soap, washing hands with regular soap results in more than a threefold increase in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparing hand washing with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, on average, for 30 seconds per procedure, showed that treatment of hands with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand alcohol solutions in reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 virus and the Clostridium Difiplée dispute in the hands of individuals, and interventions to promote hand hygiene in health facilities may include training in hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-containing solutions for the hands, as well as written and oral reminders to staff to wash hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective types of interventions in various health facilities.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important tool for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes regular washing of hands difficult.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand-washing taps are far from available in every private or public toilet, although there are also cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene may also be caused by entrenched habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging hand-washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term changes in public behaviour.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results must be monitored and evaluated.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve the health situation of the hands in countries with lower-middle incomes, community-based health and epidemiological surveillance is effective, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of advocacy for hand washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's Three Star Approach approach: it promotes simple cost-effective measures in schools to encourage students to wash their hands using soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.
By meeting minimum standards, schools can raise their levels from one to three stars.
The installation of hand-washers is one of the possible measures implemented through hand hygiene information campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
Global Handwashing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of handwashing emoji.
Some studies have examined the overall effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to DALYs (the years of life without disability preserved).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand-washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand-washing for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and “founder of modern nursing”.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were caused by rotous odours called myasmas.
In the 1980s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. became more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection, owing to outbreaks of diseases transmitted through the digestive tract and infections related to medical care.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with “right hand-washing techniques” were posted near hand-washers in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “to wash hands” is an expression of its unwillingness to accept responsibility for anything or to be a party to something.
It comes from the Bible, Matthew’s Gospel: Pontius Pilate “switched his hands” when deciding on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; this phrase was later used more widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth play, Lady Macbeth starts to unwittingly wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain that symbolizes an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes that she herself committed and prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who remember or observe an unethical act tend to wash their hands more frequently than others, and that hand-washers are more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing it will engage in other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, hand-washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand-washing by water, but without soap, is part of a ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha ' i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic hand-washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe the obligation to wash hands after visiting the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam consider it necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 production factor control
The monitoring of production factors in the context of COVID-19 implies the application of occupational safety and health techniques to control the risk and control the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper monitoring of workplace risks depends on the place and task, based on an assessment of the risks, the severity of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers that may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) reported that jobs at lower risk have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to control infection, including handwashing, incentives for workers to stay at home for signs of illness, adherence to respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Middle-risk jobs require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This may include workers who are in contact with the public, such as in schools, working environments with high population density and in some large retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic prevention measures, include high-efficiency air filters, shielding and accessible personal protection in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical and mortuary personnel who contact a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are classified as high-risk; the risk is increased to very high in the case of aerosol procedures or the collection/processing of human samples with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such personnel include the use of engineering and safety equipment, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have various effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from the workplace because of their own illness, the need to care for others or fear of infection.
Commercial templates may change for both the types of goods for which there is demand and the manner in which such goods are purchased (e.g. purchases made during non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the vehicle).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19.
The plans address the risks associated with various jobs and tasks, including sources of contamination, risk factors at home and in communities, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the controls necessary to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to recommendations at the national or state level.
Some of the goals for responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintain business operations and minimize negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is influenced by the severity of the disease in the business community.
A hierarchy of risk control tools is a framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health to organize such tools according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective safety equipment is engineering, followed by administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Engineering safety means that staff members are isolated from work-related risk areas and do not rely on the behaviour of the employee, which can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures requiring action by an employee or employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to address certain risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the threat to the employee, be of a size (e.g. respirators), be used continuously and properly, be regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and be properly filmed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Office of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) believes that jobs with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic responses to the epidemic, recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and thorough hand-washing, guidance for sick workers to stay at home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including mouth-covering with cough and sneeze, provision of napkins and garbage cans, remote or shift work readiness, as appropriate, guidance for workers avoiding the use of other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected persons is a critical step in protecting employees, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise staff with acute respiratory symptoms to stay at home until the fever, fever, and many other symptoms have ceased for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-retarding or other symptoms-retardant medications, and prescribe that hospital policy be flexible, that staff be allowed to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that staff be made aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed evidence or suspicion of infection with COVID-19, but who are likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of the spread of the disease in the community in which the business is located or because of the recent travel of the person to the COVID-19 distribution sites.
Such categories include workers in contact with the public, for example in schools, working environments with high population density and some major retail stores. Safety engineering for such groups and groups at higher risk includes the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers such as transparent plastic shields, and the installation of windows for customer services without exiting the vehicle. Administrative measures for such a group and higher-risk groups include guidance for sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of personal meetings with virtual communication, the establishment of replacement schedules, the cessation of non-critical travel to COVID-19 distribution sites, the development of emergency communication plans, including a forum for responding to concerns of workers, the provision of relevant training for workers on the risks of COVID-19 and protection measures, the training of workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, the proper use of such devices, the provision of resources and work environment conducive to personal hygiene, the requirement of regular handwashing, the restriction of access to the workplace by customers and the public, the placement of information signs on the need to use protective clothing and equipment, the correcting of such devices, the use of protective features, the use of protective clothing, or other protective measures against the use of clothing, may require the use of clothing against the use of clothing, or other protective effects of clothing.
In rare cases, workers at risk may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick on a plane, measures such as six feet ' isolation of the sick person from others, the appointment of a crew member to care for the sick person, the provision of a mask to the sick person, or the request to such person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin while coughing or sneezing are required to ensure the proper safety of workers and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear one-time medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protection if the patient has a fever, regular cough or breathing difficulties.
Used gloves and other non-refillable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and contaminated surfaces subsequently cleaned and disinfected; in cases of commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, safety measures include delaying travel in the event of illness, self-insolvation and immediately informing a medical centre on board a ship in the event of heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should take place in an isolated quarters of such a person; in the case of schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimal or average infection rate in the community, social distance strategies can be introduced, such as cancelling visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as exercise or choir singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, regulating time of arrival and care, limiting insignificant visits, and using separate health facilities for children with influenza symptoms.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, measures for long-term non-visiting of the school may be considered; for law enforcement officers with daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low according to CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are encouraged to follow the same instructions as those given to ambulance paramedics, including the use of suitable personal protective devices.
When close contact occurs during detention, employees must clean and disinfect their uniforms and equipment before reuse by household cleaning aerosols or by washing, and comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and the disposal of used personal protective equipment, as well as to use and wash clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health workers and mortuaries are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include medical, support, laboratory and transport personnel who are in contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected infection of COVID-19.
They have a very high risk of contamination in their aerosol procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 contamination.
The procedures associated with aerosol formation include sounding, cough-coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or invasive sampling.
High-risk mortuary workers include staff who handle the bodies of persons with confirmed illness or suspected of contracting COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such staff members perform autopsies, they fall into a very high-risk category; additional engineering safety equipment for such risk groups includes the use of isolated rooms for patients with confirmed illness or suspicion at COVID-19, including in procedures involving aerosol formation.
In some health facilities and morgues, the use of ad hoc ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.
Samples should be handled with the precautions required for biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be distributed to different waiting areas depending on suspected COVID-19 contamination. In addition to other personal protection, OSHA recommends that respirators be used by workers who interact up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed illness or suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as by persons performing procedures with aerosol formation.
In the U.S., NIOSH-approved respirators for a person with a N95 filter or a higher class need to be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection programme that specifies the requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort to the staff member, and WHO does not recommend the use of clothing because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted by respiratory rather than through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends the use of surgical masks only for personnel performing screening at a patient reception point.
WHO recommends that individuals collecting respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 or vectors of the disease, without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, wear a surgical mask, protective eyeglasses or face shield, robe and gloves.
In procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, a respirator N95 or FFP2 should be worn instead of a surgical mask.
Given the inadequacy of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protections by using remote medicine, physical barriers such as such transparent windows, ensuring access to a patient infected with COVID-19 only by those who provide immediate care, using only those personal protective devices that are necessary for a specific task, using the same respirator for long periods without removing, when dealing with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and recommending that no masks be used for persons without symptoms.

TOPIC: [Covid-19] Facilitation of workload and preparation for the future
DATE/VALIDATION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
AUTHORIZATIONS: CC0: No protected rights
This month, we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibilities to one another.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to sympathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen a friendly and caring relationship among all our colleagues, reflected in e-mails, phone calls and chats — a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people are working with us.
I speak of you as colleagues with great gratitude and pride.
Last week, I was informed of our appreciation for our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to reach out to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And that's possible because of your work, whether it's to make websites work, pay our colleagues, or protect community security.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.
At a time like this, not only what we do but how we do it is important to achieve meaningful results for the world.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way we work together, starting in the coming week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
In our communication, we have considered our ideas on how best to deal with the current situation and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to ease the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, so be it.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff personnel:
We expect it to take about four hours a day or 20 hours a week until further orders are issued.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs may be, whether to care for your family, to buy food, or to see a doctor, your well - being is our number one priority.
We don't keep track of your working hours.
If you're sick, you don't have to work.
That is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
There is no need for sick leave or compensatory time off: simply inform your supervisor and help the team to review the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirmed our intention to honour obligations to our contractors and employees at hourly rates.
Each person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This implies, in particular, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can produce amazing results, especially in times like these.
Again, we're talking about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust your actions accordingly.
Some work is considered to be substantial.
We must always support such activities.
Teams SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (other than others) perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are just focusing on the most important projects.
Slowing down today does not mean a negative impact in the future.
We are not planning to work “two more to catch up” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the present.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and we will work towards setting new targets and timetables, if possible.
What's going on with the APP?
In order to adjust to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timetable for the implementation of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, thus allowing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and the care of loved ones, with a reduced schedule for all those who need or want to work for the next few weeks.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, provide representatives and teams with up-to-date information on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this job.
Office status, risks and clean-up
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco colleagues could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to a lot of precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used antiviral solutions in the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as in the reception halls and elevator halls through which we can access our floor.
The building has its own rules of caution, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the time we decide to return.
Our office in D.C. (DC) is on the network of WeWork, which shared with us and all DC staff its COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in D.C. went into complete remote work in accordance with the San Francisco guidelines.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we have also discussed the issue of renting premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are continuing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues, who work remotely, are aware of the possibility of correcting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider dividing them into a course of several days.
Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda, and send out information in advance.
By default, use video links, tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate interaction and communication.
For ease of reference, appoint a focal point — a person who will monitor the receipt of questions on the chat room and the list of speakers and who is responsible for the maintenance of notes (or joint notes).
If you want to use a convenient lineup, contact the help desk via e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when buying snacks.
Connect to #remoties at Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
HR Operations is studying ergonomics manuals available in webinar format to facilitate the efficiency of distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel mass events funded by Wikimedia, such as “editathons”, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such waivers and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of undertaking concerted grant activities, and no one will be fined for having to delay or change such objectives.
In the coming week, we will carry out follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The general mood in the global community is not only a sense of frustration over the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief about mutual understanding and the ability to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and more.
In terms of perspective, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide a community space to monitor exposure and communication.
We will remain in touch on matters related to COVID-19.
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we will take the opportunity to further share relevant information, to answer your questions and to spend time together, joining one another.
We're in this situation together, and we're ready to help as much as we can.
In addition, you can continue to receive information from such e-mails, and other important information from COVID-19 is available from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If there are questions about travel, events, key workflows, problems with information coverage or other assistance, contact CRT if necessary.
We stand ready to provide support and liaison as necessary.
If you have problems with confidentiality, contact Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations, via e-mail.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
The time has come to support each other and to create space for important work to be undertaken in future weeks and, perhaps, months.
For this to happen, we will need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families and to work as efficiently as possible as soon as the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and other members of the Team Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-transverse enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the appropriate angiotensin-transverse enzyme (ACE) by reducing angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a point of entry for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-transverse enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal fermentation located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the M2 N-cone peptidasis domain and the C-conceal transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.
ACE2 is a type I unipassing membrane protein, and its fermentatively active domain reaches the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extra-cellular domain is removed from the trans-membrane domain by another enzyme known as scheddase, and the soluble protein produced is released into the bloodstream and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of the fine intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
ACE2 and RNA biosynthesis is also found in the cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE splits angiotensin I hormone into a vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, removes the carboxyl end amino acid phenylalanin from angiotenzin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tir-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into a vasodilate angiotenin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tire-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also divide a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - bradikinin, apelin, neurotenzine, dinorphine A and Grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the transport of the transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is present during Hartnoup's disease.
As a trans-membrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS call virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, the binding of S1 protein to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the fermentative ACE2 domain on the cell surface results in endocitis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosoms located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the pre-primation of S-protein protein with TMPRSSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, leading some to the idea that decreasing ACE2 levels in cells can help control infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend the continuation of standard APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic survey and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant 34 per cent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared with the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors, who were exposed to higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with strokes and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than in patients with a general risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is believed to be an innovation in the treatment of acute lung injuries and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory deficiency syndrome caused by lipolisacharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the beginning of action is 30 minutes, in addition to 24 hours of exposure.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with the intolerance of classical retin angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases that increase the circulation of angiotensine II. The introduced rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory destress syndrome treatment.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile phone applications designed to assist in epidemiological investigations in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identifying persons (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications have been developed or proposed and are officially supported by the authorities.
Several versions of contact tracking applications have been developed.
This gave rise to a discussion of confidentiality issues, particularly with regard to those systems that are based on the geographical location of application users.
The softer options in this respect include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Google and Apple announced on April 10, 2020 that they would combine their efforts to integrate Bluetooth support for such applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, launched an application that allows citizens to check whether they had contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and Singapore uses an app called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be handed over to the government.
The annex was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking app was in the final stages of development and would be available for deployment for several weeks; similar applications were planned to be launched in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether application and BlueTrace protocol, and Russia intends to use a geozonation application to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a security professor at Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with applications-based systems, including false response and potential inefficiency if only a small proportion of the population uses the application.
In view of concerns about the proliferation of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that could offer their coronavirus applications in the App Store to include only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also imposed similar restrictions.
Participants in the privacy campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus applications; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of this type of oversight.
The organizations have declared eight conditions for public projects:
Surveillance should be “lawful, necessary and proportionate”;
Enhanced monitoring and observation should be accompanied by time-limit clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the dissemination of COVID-19;
The security and anonymity of the data should be protected and evidence of such security should be provided;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any data exchange with third parties should be determined by law;
Protection from abuse should be guaranteed, as should the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Owne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing their joint plan to address the ongoing monitoring problem, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, web-based location tracking is used instead of applications, thus eliminating the need to download the application and the possibility of avoiding tracing.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have major potential confidentiality problems.
However, not all central server systems should have access to personal location data; a number of confidential systems have been developed that use central servers only for communications purposes (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking data on mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected persons, but also made the location information publicly available, which was made possible by the significant changes in the legislation on protection of information that had taken place since the outbreak of MERS in that country.
Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details had not yet been made public.
Contact tracking, which preserves confidentiality, is a well-established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013; as of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups have been working on confidentiality solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record users approaching other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is the product of a coordination effort that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized confidential tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all comparisons occur on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that preserves confidentiality in the collection and use of location data or track intersections to track the distribution of COVID-19.
The work of the platform is based on studies published in the March 2020 document Apps Gone Rogue: Mainining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a confidentiality technology company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware to enable users to share confidential location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of the data.
On 5 April 2020, a global coalition of TCNs was formed by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of tracking and warning applications, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to preserve confidentiality.
They also published technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Deployment of tools to enable Governments to create official applications to track the movement of Coravirus-infected citizens, while maintaining data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple, they plan to solve constant surveillance problems by first implementing the system by updating the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Repository of a drug (also known as reprofiling, diversion, change of task or therapeutic diversion) is the reprofiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or a medical condition other than that originally envisaged for development.
This is one of the areas of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 and the transfusion of reconvalescence plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these connecting areas provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against the COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papin-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADF-ribophosphatease.
Hussein AA and the co-authors in their pre-clinical study examined several candidate compounds, which were then optimized, and analysed their similarity with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical research.
Chlorochine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the clinical test “Solidarity”.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would be tested in New York State on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical trials and was only allowed under the EUA as an experimental emergency treatment for patients who have been hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical trials.
CDC stated that “the order of use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine intake for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” had not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when "there's no other way."
The Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University School of Medicine in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
China’s clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that the favipirvir is “soundly effective.”
The 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug had a negative result on average after 4 days, while 45 patients who did not took the drug had a duration of 11 days.
A study was carried out in Wuhan to monitor 240 patients with pneumonia, half of whom received a favipirvir and half of whom received a UMiphenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the results, which showed the efficacy of the drug, were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to replenish its stock, and that military resources would be used to deliver it to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe reported to the Trump Administration that it could be less effective in neglected cases.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant patients or for patients who try to get pregnant.
One study on the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (Caletra) antiviral drugs concluded that “no effective use of the drugs has been identified”.
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by linking to proteasis.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado are trying to modify the drugs to find a connection that will connect to the SARS-CoV-2 protein.
WHO included a combination of lopinavire and ritonavira in the international Solidarity test.
The Remdesiver was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections, and later Gilead Sciences found that the Remdesive had antiviral activity in vitro for a variety of phylo, pneumo, paramixo and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations, which can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remdesives may have a high genetic barrier to resistance; several clinical trials are under way, including two by Cleveland University clinics; one by moderate patients; and the other by patients with heavier forms.
There are currently three clinical trials for vitamin C injection for people hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, tests began in New York State for antibiotics of asythromicin.
The Japanese National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cykesonide) Tajgen, an inhalation corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for use in the treatment of presymptom patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II, a form of angiotensin-transverse enzyme 2, is being tested with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of disease to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over were invited to be diagnosed with COVID-19 with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breast-feeding and non-effective contraceptive methods are not available for women to participate in this study.
Several coagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Authority to publish recommendations on the use of the drug.
On 14 April, a 300-patient multi-centre study on the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the reprofiling of approved antiviral drugs that were developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment by COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for treatment by COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially suitable for treatment by COVID-19:
Tocilium (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has undergone clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would be available in more than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates underwent phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, resulting in significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020 there were 10 different technology platforms under study and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I safety studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRNA-1273)
Virus vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are at an early stage of development, 78 of which are used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 additional candidate vaccines have been announced, but there is little publicly available information (presumably at the planning or development stage).
Phases I to II provide pre-tests for safety and immune status, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and at several sites, with more accurate and effective doses determined at the same time.
Phase III of the test usually involves more participants, including a control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for disease prevention effectiveness and, at the same time, side effects are monitored at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccines under active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on a person (still in pre-clinical testing).
On January 24, 2020, Queensland University, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of Saskatchewan University, Canada, announced that it would begin work on its own vaccine to begin testing on humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were also launched at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.

Other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland universities.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers from Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-integrated COVID-19 RNA.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced $275 million to fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccine candidate drugs in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and Saskatchewan University.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans to establish a national vaccine bank, which will include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing PittCoVac, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, stating that "MNA introduced subunit vaccines to SARS-CoV-2 S1, causing strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies [to mice] that appeared two weeks after immunization".
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Medicine of Canada announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that might be produced as a nasal spray.
With bacteria, DNA will reproduce within human bacteria and form harmless viral particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities combined IBM supercomputer resources with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages than those of disease prevention.
Another randomized study in Australia involves 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Early studies to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and low primates, indicate the need for control measures with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as for international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines that are safe and effective for people to treat SARS.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the study of SARS, which was conducted at the time, could become the standard for developing vaccines and therapeutics against the infection of MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) vaccine for MERS, which passed stage I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines and were under development, two of which were adenovirus (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one of which was MVA-MERS-S.
There was a conspiracy theory on social media that claimed that the COVID-19 virus was not new and that a vaccine already existed.
Publications on social media quoted the words of some patients who claimed that patents existed on the genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and respiratory difficulties.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the first symptom to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
The majority of cases consist of mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease has become viral pneumonia and polyorganic insufficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people had died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus mainly spreads when people are in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops released into the air by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these drops are formed by exhalation, they usually pose a threat to the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air at long distances.
People are also infected by touching a contaminated surface and then by their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of the symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before the onset of the symptoms and at later stages.The standard diagnostic method is a polymerazic chain reaction with real-time inverse transcription (PT-PRC) on a sample taken as a nosing swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients suspected of being ill, as well as to those who care for them.
The recommendations on the use of medical masks vary from one department to another, with some agencies recommending that they should not be used at all, some recommending that they should be used, and others requiring them.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
The local spread of the disease was reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Acute symptoms include difficulties in breathing, constant pain or chest depression, confusion of consciousness, difficulties in awakening, blueness of the face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, immediate medical attention should be sought.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneeze, sneeze, or throat pain, may be less common.
Also, there are different percentages of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Some cases reported in China were initially shown only by chest depression and high heart rate.
In some cases, the disease can progress by developing into pneumonia, polyorganic insufficiency, and eventually death occurs.
It's called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5 per cent of people, symptoms begin to manifest within 11.5 days of infection; not all infected people are reported to show symptoms.
The role of such non-symptom carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected people with an unsymptomous course of disease is currently unknown and is only being studied; the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospital cases related to the virus showed no symptom.
The National Health Commission of China began to include unsymptomous cases in its daily report on 1 April; of the 166 cases recorded on that date, 130 (78%) were not symptomous at the time of testing.
Both wet and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
When you speak loudly, more drops are released into the air than when you speak normal volume.
A study in Singapore showed that drops can spread up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) when coughed open.
The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioaerosol transmission of virus particles is still possible, and air testing performed by air collectors located in corridors outside human rooms has shown the presence of viral RNAs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (CPR), may lead to exhalation products being sprayed and hence to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through feces, but the risk is considered to be low; the virus is the most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms occur, but the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that it is still unclear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects 2 or 3 other people, and that the virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface the virus could live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) up to three days, and on the copper surface 99 per cent up to four hours.
These values, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, if properly used, have a rather useful effect in terms of controlling contamination: soap destroys the adipose protective layer of the virus by deactivating it and can remove it from the surface of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorogexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus; in a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and the sixth test showed the highest levels of the virus in the blood on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens up its protective shell.
Lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19 because the virus penetrates host cells through the angiotensin-transverse enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell with a characteristic surface glycoprotein, a spike.
Twelve per cent of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan have been diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in the case of a serious form of disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in large numbers in the heart as they participate in the work of this body.
The high frequency of thrombosis (31 per cent) and venous thromboemboli (25 per cent) was observed in patients in the ISA with COVID-19 and may indicate adverse predictions. The autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar injuries (DAD) and lymphocyto-containing inflammatory inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropicism towards ACE2-expressive epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 are showing symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic T-cell GM-CSFs were found to be correlated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that emit IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
The autopsy also found lymphocytral infiltrates.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
Real-time polymuscular chain reaction (PTC-PRC) is a standard test method.
The test is usually conducted on respiratory samples swabbed from the nostril, but a swab from the nose or wetting may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks and the results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have managed to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of the virus.
As at 4 April 2020, antibodies tests that could detect current infection as well as possible past contamination were under development but were not yet widely available.
The Chinese experience with the test results has shown that the accuracy of the test results is only 60 to 70 per cent.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, allowing it to be used at the end of this month.
Two-way multi-dimensional subpleural compactions of the type of “matched glass” with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of a rock bridge (additional thickening of the variable alveolar partition) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main results of the pathological examination carried out during the autopsy are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleurite, pericarditis, compaction and pulmonary edema
Four types of severe viral pneumonia can be observed:
slight pneumonia: lung edema, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multi-nuclear giant cells
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory destress syndrome (RSD) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar floors and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffuse intravascular coiling (DVS syndrome); leukoeritroplastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing the rules of respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inner side of the ulna arm.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to perform a quality hygiene procedure for the hands.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue masks in public places, in particular to limit transmission of infection by people with an unsymptomous disease; strategies for social discontinuance are aimed at reducing contact between infected patients and large groups of people; schools and businesses have been closed down, the movement of citizens has been restricted and major public events have been cancelled.
Recommendations on distance also imply that people must be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no proven effective drugs against COVID-19, as the completion of the vaccine is not expected until 2021, the bulk of the action against the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as the Plateau.
CDC also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with heavy hand contamination, and before eating and after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of disinfectant alcohol (at least 60% alcohol content) for hand treatment, but only where soap and water are not available. In regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two recipes for local production.
These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not suitable for antiseptic arm treatment.
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and other affected vital organs.
CDC advises those who suspect they are infected with the virus to wear a regular medical mask.
Extra-corporate membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory deficiency, but its benefits are still being explored.
Personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diets are recommended to strengthen immunity.
Supportive therapy can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease, and WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care doctors and pulmonologists compiled the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free-of-charge resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
In order to treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health workers recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.
Precautionary measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in health facilities, in procedures during which aircapular discharges may occur, such as intubation or hand drying.
CDC recommends that health care workers who care for people with COVID-19 should be placed in the AIIR, an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. CDC has published recommendations on the use of personal protective equipment (IPPs) during the pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves; the use of respirators rather than medical masks is preferable to those listed above.
The N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under the Emergency Permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but the effectiveness of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed when used without instructions.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective face screens or, as a last resort, the manufacture of self-contained masks at home.
In most cases, the forms of COVID-19 are not heavy enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or an alternative, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory deficiency associated with COVID-19 is being actively studied and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided with an intense airflow nasal oxygen cannula or two levels of positive respiratory pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two methods is as effective for patients in critical condition as ISL.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs if it is available because it significantly limits the spread of particles in the air as compared to the nose cans with high air flow; the risk of severe disease for older persons (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there is a shortage of hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the dramatic increase in the incidence of severe COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization.
According to one study in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support with light ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of ventilating the lungs becomes more complex, as acute respiratory dysthesis (ARDS) developed at COVID-19 and oxygenation is becoming more and more problematic.
An IWL supported by inhalation pressure and a PVC is necessary to deliver maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimum ventilation damage that may result in the development of a pneumothorax.
In earlier fan models, high VACs may not be available.
Research on potential treatment began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials.
Remdesir is the most promising.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe illnesses.
WHO-recommended volunteers participate in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.
It has not been the subject of clinical research, which must be conducted to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to control the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect “near contact” with surveillance data and thus determine the potential risk of contamination.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-insolvency but also sends a notification to local health authorities, analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence, such tools are used to track infected people and persons they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to track the mobile phone data of people who were allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Measures had been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who could contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, the German federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute provided aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to detect quarantine violators.
Italy's Regional Commissioner for Health, Giulio Gallera, reported that cellular network operators reported that “40 per cent of people are still moving across the territory.”
The Government of Germany held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonia’s President Kersti Kaljulide also called for creative solutions against the proliferation of the coronavirus.
People may be stressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor: “Enhanced social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming the mental health and well-being of people.”
The disease may occur in light form with slight or missing symptoms that resemble other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds.
Patients with a mild form of illness usually recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may require between three and six weeks to be treated.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are not available; in some people, COVID-19 may hit lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In those with the most severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorganic insufficiency.
CoVID-19 complications include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and heart, kidney and liver problems.
The abnormality of thrombosis, especially the increase in protrombin time, was described in 6 per cent of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while a kidney failure was observed in 4 per cent of this group.
About 20 to 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to intensive care was seven days.
According to early-stage studies, the average time from the onset of initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of 6 to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
Histopathological studies of postmortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromixoid exudates in both lungs.
Pneumocytes showed viral cytopatic changes.
The appearance of the lung was similar to the acute respiratory dysthesis syndrome (ODS).
In 11.8 per cent of deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were associated with increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary according to the state due to such regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
Lack of effective counting of cases in light form could lead to an overestimation of mortality.
Nevertheless, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is undervalued.
The severe symptoms of COVID-19 were generally 1.4 times more common among smokers, and these patients were about 2.4 times more likely to be in need of intensive care or to die than non-smokers, and concerns were expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of a clinic in Hong Kong found that some of the patients who recovered from the disease had their lungs reduced by 20 to 30 per cent, and their scans revealed injuries.
After recovery, this can also lead to “After Intensive Care” syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients recovering from the virus were immune to the virus.
According to the current of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but there have also been reported cases where, after recovery from COVID-19, the coronavirus tests were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an increased long-term disease rather than a re-infection.
The virus is considered to be natural, of animal origin and an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, describes 1 December 2019 as the earliest date of the first case.
According to official figures published by WHO, the date was 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary from region to region and time of disease, and are also affected by levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatments used, the time since the outbreak of the disease and population parameters such as age, gender and general health status.
In late 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency codes: U07.1 for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed infections SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections was 6.9 per cent (153,822/2 240 191).
This figure varies from one region to another: some other methods include the determination of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of patients diagnosed who have died as a result of the disease, as well as the determination of the transmitted infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the performance of a certain segment of the population from the time of infection until the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced by all patients who have suffered the infection, the presence of such antibodies makes it possible to understand how many people have been infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castillon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival celebrations among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health-care system has not been overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies, based on donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.04% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates vary between men and women.
According to studies in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The group most at risk is men over the age of 50; the gap between men and women has been narrowing only since the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this discrepancy are not known, but may be genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, associated diseases among men (e.g. hypertension in younger men than among women) can lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of those infected were men, and 72 per cent of deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has no gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ODS have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are therefore more likely to be infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanham Gebreisus, explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease”, and 19 is the year when the outbreak first occurred: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a particular geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by international naming recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the "coronavirus" and the "Hank coronavirus".
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in disease and virus names, WHO recommended the use of the terms “a severe respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names for the virus and disease.
The official names "COVID-19" and "SARS-CoV-2" were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to limitations in the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical materials, such as nose swabs, as well as parts of IVL machines.
In one such case, the Italian clinic was in urgent need of a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time, at which time one of the local operations was reprofiled and could print the required 100 valves overnight.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak, various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake information about the origin of the virus, its extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects became widely available on the Internet.
It's possible people can infect other animals with the virus.
Research has not confirmed the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks, and chickens.
To date, there is no approved vaccine against the virus or medication for its treatment.
Various international studies on vaccines and medicines from COVID-19 are currently being carried out by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SoLIDARITY Trial programme, which aims to assess the treatment effects of four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no ready vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidate drugs.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so scientific research uses the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to induce a rapid human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that increases the immune system's sensitivity to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S-pump protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid vaccines (NDCs or RNAs, new vaccine development methodology).
Pilot vaccines developed under either strategy should be tested for safety and effectiveness. The first clinical trial of four volunteers began in Seattle on 16 March 2020.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease, and the anti-teleposim increase has been identified as one of the potential problems in developing vaccines for SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials were under way.
Medicines approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven tests, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The reprofiling of antiviral drugs constitutes the majority of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine studies of phase III remediaire had been carried out in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 had been carried out. To the same end, several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 were also being considered, including remdesives, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritavir and lopinavir/ritavir in combination with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivers.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients receiving remdesives as an exception.
Phase III of the clinical trials is already under way in the United States, China and Italy, and the use of chloroquine previously used for malaria treatment was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
Nevertheless, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virusology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a permit for emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazokanid was recommended for detailed study in vivo, showing the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that serin sac 2 is needed to penetrate SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with the ACE2 receptor to apply the protein of a trans-membrane protease serin 2 (TMPRSSS2).
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without asythromicin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study. The Öseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercitokinemia may occur as a complication at late stages of the heavy form COVID-19.
There is evidence of the fact that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinemia properties, and a small study by the National Health Commission of China has included tocilysumabe in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
The drug has reached the second stage of an unrandomized test, which is conducted at the national level in Italy, after positive results have been obtained in patients with a serious form of illness.
Combined with the analysis of ferritin serum to detect cytokinic storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleykin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies to treat the steroid refractory cytokin release syndrome caused by another cause, the CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilyzumub is an effective treatment for cytoxin release syndrome.
