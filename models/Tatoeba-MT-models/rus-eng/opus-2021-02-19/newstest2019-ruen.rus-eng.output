Number of new recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbas
The official spokesman for the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), Andrei Marochko, stated that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbas in the winter of 2018-2019.
According to him, this is how Kiev plans to “sometimes complete the units”.
“The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the massive dismissals have resulted in a low staffing of the units”, Marochko said, quoted by RIA News.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainian conscripts could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces Operation (JUS).
This measure was expected to strengthen the role of Ukrainian silos in the resolution of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbas was exacerbated by the murder of the head of the DNR, Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DNR authorities described what had happened as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several persons involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary reports, they confirmed that Ukrainian intelligence services had organized the sabotage.
The U.S. authorities forced the Mask to resign as chairman of the Tesla board.
American businessman Ilon Musk will be leaving as chairman of the Board of Directors of his Tesla company at the request of the U.S. authorities.
To settle the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission's claims, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million.
According to CNBC, a pre-trial agreement with the agency allows the Mask to remain at the top of Tesla.
In doing so, he is required to pay $20 million and leave the office of chairman of the board within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is specified that the agreement has yet to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it was reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of misleading shareholders by claiming that there were sufficient funds to buy out the company's shares and sued an entrepreneur.
It's about publishing a businessman on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy out the shares of Tesla for $420 apiece, but he never did.
After the tweet, the company's stock grew by almost 11%.
The head of British MDA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and the prison.
Britain’s Foreign Minister, Jeremy Hunt, compared the EU to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of captivating the member countries of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail notes, this is how Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to believing in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from community to prison, the desire to leave it will not be diminished, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wishes to flee from captivity.”
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to leave the EU would only exacerbate the crisis, noting Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Brexit negotiations had stalled.
So she commented on the outcome of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was adopted in 2016 as a result of a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom was expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on the issue were complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.

The head of the Altai Village Council has stopped the hunger strike in favour of the inhabitants
The deputy reported on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the village council stated that the situation was at a standstill, that the district administration was not responding to his demands and that he needed to do his job.
In addition, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has begun to verify the situation, and the StPC heating organization has promised to begin work on preparing the system for the winter heating period of the village of Siberia next week.
The villagers also prepared and took to the Governor of Altai Province a massive collective appeal “concerning the current catastrophic situation”.
Boronin himself reported that he was feeling well, and he was fully involved in his duties as head of the hunger strike.
According to Boronin, the villages of Siberia and Rogulic have centralized heating systems, which means that the authorities of the Pervomaysk region should be responsible for preparing them for winter.
So far, however, no one has begun to do so.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the Government of Altai province and against the financial policy of Gazprom Interregiongaz Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the villages for winter, Boronin required “the immediate establishment of a fully independent communal sector with the respective units of staff in the municipality”.
Named Moscow's new buildings with the cheapest apartments.
In the first half of 2018, about 3,000 housing units with an area of 30 square metres and up to 4 million rubles were purchased in Moscow's new buildings.
More than half of these transactions were handled by two LCDs, as evidenced by the Urbanus portal (available to Lenta.ru).
Up to four million rubles of housing sales were led by the LK Nekrasvka, located behind ICAD, in the Kotelniki district (SWAO), and the Barbaris apartment complex in the Bibyrevo district (SWAO).
Two HQs in New Moscow, South Bunia and maple alleys, were also visible in the structure of the transactions.
Urbanus analysts note that the share of apartment transactions of up to four million rubles in these new buildings amounts to 60 per cent of all sales and provides half of the total revenue.
“The impact of apartments with less than four million rubles on the commercial success of the central neighbourhood in the New Watutinks and the Lugh Philathoves is recognized,” says a study of two more New Moscow FCs.
They account for about 35 per cent of financial income.
Previously, Moscow's lowest-cost housing areas were rated at the Bon Ton Real Estate Agency.

Telegram users complained of a failure in the new version
iPhone users complained about problems with the Telegram Messenger after the September 28 update.
The number of the user can be found on his username.
The complaints relate to gadgets with an iOS 12 active operating system.
According to their owners, when updated, the application displays a white screen or closes immediately.
The Messinger's representatives reacted to the malfunction.
They said that the problem might be the migration of information to a new application written in Swift.
Telegram temporarily suspended the automatic update of the application until the problem was resolved.
On 13 April, the Tagan Court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's claim to block the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the communications operators began to execute the decision.
The reason for this was the refusal of the Messinger administration to provide the FSB with the key to decrypting correspondence necessary to obtain terrorist data.
In August Telegram changed the policy of confidentiality and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a terrorist suspect to the user when a court decision was reached.
Telegram's audience decreased by 1.2 million after blocking the FM.

Chief Coach "Avangard" Bob Hartley summarized the results of the regular KHL championship against the Minx "Dinamo" (2:1).
It's a very important victory for us.
After the match in St. Petersburg, we held a meeting and agreed to leave the game behind and prepare for Minsk.
They knew that Dinamo had a good win before we met, so they were preparing very seriously.
It was important to drop out in most, I'm happy for the guys who went on a numerical advantage.
We've been playing pretty well in most of these days, but we couldn't beat it.
The red light's finally on at the gate.
We knew Minsk would come out loaded for the game, he'd try, and that's what happened.
Most of the game has become the defining goal, the winning goal we scored in the unequal compositions.
We had a good third period today, even though we missed an early goal in this segment and it was clear that it would not be easy in the future.
But we played very well in defense, didn't give a lot of chance to our rival, didn't let us catch up on shifts, the Dynamo didn't have a numerical advantage attack, so it ended well for us, as Hartley of the Oms Club Press Service quotes.

Elon Musk is forced to resign as head of the Tesla board.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla, Ilon Musk, settled their dispute in the fraud case.
CNBC News reports it.
According to the network, as part of the arrangements made, Musku will have to resign as head of the Tesla board of directors.
In doing so, the commission allowed the Mask to retain the position of leader of Tesla.
It is noted that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be collected from Tesla.
In doing so, the money will be distributed to the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American businessman on the list of the 50 richest people in the Forbes magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX Space Corporation, Neuralink Neurothecology Company and the developer of Tesla electric carts, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission previously sued Tesla's CEO, Ilon Musk, because of his tweeted report about a possible buy-out.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy out all shares on the stock market at a fixed price of $420.
The value of $420 was allegedly established “because of the importance of this number in marijuana culture”, previously reported by Bloomberg with reference to the co-director of the security department of the Steven Paykin Commission.
At the same time, Ilon Musk subsequently refused his plans to buy out the shares.
Commenting on a lawsuit filed against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered the fraud charges to be unfounded, adding that he was very disappointed and saddened by the claims.
"honesty is the most important value of my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way," said the businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action against Mask, claiming financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the positions of the businessman had caused them loss.
In particular, one shareholder stated that the tweets of a businessman were misleading, forcing Tesla shareholders to purchase papers at artificially overpriced prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Ilon Musk’s careless remarks led to sharp fluctuations of course.
In September, Ilon Musk accused the head of the research company Citron Research of trading.
However, if Musk could not resolve his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be in danger of being removed from the company’s management and even prison.
This was reported in particular by former Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt to CNBC.
The mask is "a good guy who doesn't know how to run a car company."

The RPP compared the possible renaming of the RCP to the actions of the fascists
The head of the External Church Relations Division of the Moscow Patriarchate of Volokolam Ilarion compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists in Germany.
Mytropolis Volokolam Ilarion - on the causes of the conflict with the Constantinople Patriarch, the possible division of the church and its political background
In his words, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute phase”, renaming the church is like wearing a yellow six-point star in fascist Germany.
“It means marking the church as an enemy organization, and it was for that purpose that the bill was created,” said a representative of the RPP on Russian 24.
The Mitropolit also stressed that the UPC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, because “the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country”.

Sochi Grand Prix: Anschlag, Russian car and the return of Kwaya
Over the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
The deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Kozak, announced this, summarizing the meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
The Vice-President of the Government also shared his views on the return of Daniel Kwata to Toro Rosso and appreciated the visit to the Russian phase of Form 1.
The outcome of our meeting with auto manufacturers should, in the foreseeable future, be the creation of the Russian Form 1 car, which has no counterparts in the world, Dmitry Kozak said.
We have to encourage our automakers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I don't think it's possible at that time.
I think it's a more realistic time frame for the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014, the Marusya team performed in "Formula 1" under a Russian licence.
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors willing to invest in forming a domestic team at the Formula One World Motor Race Championship.
I know there are car sports fans in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, willing to invest in the Russian Form One team, he said.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team came about, also because Sochi has such infrastructure."
The Sochi Autodrome is waiting for an opening tomorrow.
According to Dmitri Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even the qualifications of the rostrum were almost complete,” the vice-premier pointed out.
I can tell you that this year's revenue has increased by 72% over last year.
That's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the effectiveness of the Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
It's going to be an extra tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitri Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian auto-sports are Daniel Kwiat's return to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him success in the next season,' said the vice prime minister.
He's a very promising driver.
Next year, for the first time in history, the two main Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Formula One Peloton.
Although the future fate of Sergei Sirotkin in the "Royal Races" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are yet to be impressive: he took 18th place in the Russian Grand Prix.
Let's hope there are more of our main pilots next season than this year, says Dmitri Kozak.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of an era of modern antibiotics, bringing Fleming global glory and making him Nobel laureate.
By the way, removing penicillin from moldy mushrooms wasn't Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, when he was cold, he sown slime from his own nose on Petri's cup (a glass cap in which bacteria are tested) and a few days later discovered that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
He also discovered penicillin almost by accident.
Fleming's name was listed on the list of the 100 most prominent individuals in human history.
His discovery, according to many scholars, changed the course of history.
With penicillin, medicine began to deal with most of the oldest diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, the Paris newspapers wrote: “To defeat fascism and liberate France, he did more than dozens of divisions.”
Experts estimate that Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotics saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.

Trump talked about "love" at Kim Jong-un.
From mutual cruelty, US and DPRK leaders almost fell in love with each other, joked Donald Trump.
US President Donald Trump made a good joke about his success on the North Korean crisis front.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now changed their relationship so much that they are almost in love with each other, as the American president pointed out.
The White House owner recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama’s team had initiated such a relationship with the DPRK that they could not even reach the country’s leaders – they simply did not pick up the phone.
At the time, the US and the DPRK were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House "fine letters," marked Trump.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, he was also cruel to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
But now their relationship has recovered so much that the leaders have fallen in love with each other.
However, Trump asked that his words not be taken literally and warned that the American media interpreted them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the recent cessation of nuclear and missile tests by Pyongyang, as well as the closure of military test sites.
All of this is due to the work of his administration, I'm sure the American president.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke flatteringly of Kim Jong Eun from the rostrum of the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and the steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump noted, however, that the sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the Korean peninsula was fully denuclearized.
Negotiations in Singapore

The meeting resulted in the cessation of the nuclear and missile tests of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea and the return to the United States of America of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still piling up.
The media reported that, after the Singapore summit, the US had already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangster".

Nice called for the replacement of “Moscow language with Ukrainian product”
The Ukrainian children's writer and cleaner Laris Nice called for the removal of “Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language” from Ukraine.
To do so, she offers a Ukrainian product - a "cultural wave, a cultural offensive".
Nitsa shared her ideas on the “propossibility of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian publication “The Spectator”.
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product was being prepared - it was already in existence and was continuing to develop.
In time, the Ukrainians will "well" from this "Moscow language," she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that Russian language had previously been widely used on television and radio, but that there was little left in public space.
In the view of Nice, however, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities which prohibit the use of the Russian language are, in her view, only “extension of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Nitsoy had previously shared the experience of maintaining a “Ukrainian-speaking regime” in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watsons bookstores, one of which spoke to her in Russian.
When she didn't get her way, she threw a change at the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", encouraging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of surnames.
Recently, Nitsoy claimed that the name Rushu was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not escape the scorn of the writer: when she came there and heard staff talking to each other in Russian, she started a scandal and left by slamming the door.

"You missed a few matches because of the damage you sustained at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today?"
"If it took 90 minutes, everything's fine!
I actually felt good.
Maybe there's a little bit of strength at the end, so it doesn't happen.
And so, the doctors and physical therapist Vladimir Anatolievich Gashnev led me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
"What do you think of the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after winning, it's easier to recover, and the mood is good in the community.
Now we've got a white stripe, but it was black at first.
We need to keep this up and cheer up the fans."
"Have you missed the game for the time you didn't go to the field?"
"That's what I miss a little, 'cause it's really a bad situation.
But again, thank you to the physical therapist and the doctors for putting them on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and cheered up the fans.
And the rest is secondary."

The prosecution for the Dagestan deputy is news.
The Soviet district court of Mahachkala detained for two months a member of the People ' s Assembly, Dagestan Rajab Abdulatipov, who was suspected of involvement in a criminal association and who had processed a disability for bribery.
"IA" became aware of the details of the investigation, which shed light on how, according to the Russian Investigation Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the Republic, Ramazan Abdulatipov, Rajab Abdulatipov, had contributed to the criminal activities of the former head of the Chief Medical and Social Expertise Office, Mohammed Mahachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, in the course of the investigative activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was found that Rajab Abdulatipov had lobbied for the appointment of Mohammed Mahachev as head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles for that purpose.
In the past, the investigation of Magomed Mahachev, other leaders and employees of the territorial medical and social assessment offices under his supervision, brought criminal proceedings under article 210 (establishment and participation in a criminal association using official position), article 290 (receipt of bribe by an organized group), article 292 (service fraud) and article 159 (fraud of a particularly large scale) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
According to the investigation, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, aware of the illegal activities of Mohammed Mahachev and his associates involved in the theft of Pension Fund funds, joined their activities by joining a criminal association.
As head of the administration of the Federal Migration Service of Russia for Dagestan, and having links with State authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as using their related relations with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, investigators consider that “ensure the activities of other members of the criminal association, establish contacts with State officials in order to support the illegal activities of Mohammed Mahachev and his position as head of the federal prison “General Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise for the Republic of Dagestan” organized the unlawful identification of persons with disabilities”.
Following the announcement of this information at the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything I'm being charged with today, it's all new to me, I'm totally not familiar with it," he said.
The court did not arrest a deputy from “One Russia” for 10 days prior to the indictment, as was the case with previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for two months immediately, since article 210 of the Criminal Code appeared in his case.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is a much longer period of time before an investigation can be charged, up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

The head coach of Locomotive Yuri Semin spoke of the importance of Manuel Fernandez, who cannot negotiate a new contract with the club.
Fernandesh is the man who teaches young people to play good football.
"Zenite" is the best point.
Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, Russia ' s topic was virtually absent in negative terms.
The head of the Council of the Federation for International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly to be a success for Russia and does not rule out that it can be a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral part of the solution of global problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years with regard to Russia has now been in order more muted,” said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation had sometimes been “designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, but along with Ebola, climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, at least in the statement of a group of Western countries, which had spoken with sufficient unanimity in that regard”.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, “the Russian theme was virtually absent in negative terms”.
"If you look carefully at the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at any rate the choir was not absolutely accurate," the politician noticed that Russia "was no longer a wall about which the tennis ball was trained."
The head of the relevant committee of Sovfed does not exclude that this indicates a trend which he considers “will single out the present session of the [UNH], although this trend may be fully evident in a year, two, three”.
“I do not rule out that this session may in some sense be a turning point,” Kosachev said, explaining that “too many examples of how Russia’s integration can move forward in international affairs”.
He gave an example of the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“Until this is unfortunately not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be needed over time,” the parliamentarian added.
This is because he believes that there is an “adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possible — indispensable participant in the solution of today's global problems”.
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that somewhere we're going through a point where we're not going to move backwards, it's going to move forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context was referred to by Kosachev as “the demand for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I have attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I have held my own meetings, and I have been very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago Russia’s view, Russia’s vision of what is happening in the world, was largely uninterested, the situation is different now,” said the Chairman of the Sovfed Committee.
In his view, this is because “the so-called new liberal order represented by the West does not have answers to the questions of how to solve world problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in global space, the lack of ideas on how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, the problems of migration”.
“And here the demand for Russian vision is becoming more and more evident,” expressed Kosachev's confidence, stressing that in this sense he considered “the current session to be a good one for the Russian delegation's work, a good one for Russia”.
Orphankin finished last at the Russian Grand Prix "Formula-1"
That's a great result for Max.
Considering he started from 19th position!
It's like a birthday party.
The Dutchman's upset, though.
And we congratulate Hamilton.
His separation from Fettel increased by 50 points.
Bottas is on the side looking angry, I guess.
In Damascus, declared the right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that military force will not be used in the Syrian province of Idlib, as stated by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
Syria, he said, had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had an opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the withdrawal of fighters from the demilitarized zone in Idlib by the organization Jebhat al-Nusra, banned in Russia, reported to RIA Novosti.
The head of MIDA also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of Euphrates if the Kurds were to seek separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted by the US.
On 17 September, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdoğan agreed to establish by 15 October a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry's in charge of the Chelsea Youth Team.
It was previously reported that a 37-year-old defence counsel had negotiated a transition to the Moscow “Spartacus”.
According to RT, referring to Mirror, former British captain John Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.
According to the source, a well-known player who has long been a member of the London club will run the team at least 23 years of age.
It's reported that at Terry's trainer's headquarters, Jody Morris, who left for Derby County, will be replaced.
Remember, in September, Terry was close to moving to Moscow's Spartacus, but eventually abandoned the idea after talking to his family.
The first vice-speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Irina Geravenko, apologized to the Russian Federation for the "spying" of Ukrainian journalist Roman Sušchenko for not having been able to release him from his jails.
She mentioned this in a video message to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko by the FSB.
According to her, an action was taking place under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris these days, in which the participants launched a hunger protest to demand the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, some of them who know you well, starve to support Oleg Sentsov, the other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, demanded no pressure on the Kremlin, no pressure on Putin with one demand: the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those children who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbas and Crimea,” Geravenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the trials would bring about every Ukrainian by making us “worst, tougher in defending Ukraine's national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil”.
As a reminder, Ukrinfora correspondent in France, Roman Sušchenko, was arrested by Russian silos on 30 September 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage with the General Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sušchenko to 12 years of maximum-regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia declared the verdict lawful.
Russian jailers granted the Ukrainian's last request before he was transferred to the colony.
NASA reported an asteroid the size of Big Ben approaching the Earth.
NASA, the American Space Agency, reported that a large asteroid SP1 could reach the Earth with a length of up to 160 metres.
According to the Daily Express, the space object may exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or London's wheel of view.
However, precise data on its size are not yet available.
The speed at which SP1 moves is about 60,000 km/h. The smallest distance between the asteroid and Earth will be 3 October.
It will then pass by our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first detected on September 19th.
NASA listed it as near-Earth objects.
Earlier, on September 27, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency published the first ever video from the surface of the asteroid Ryuga.
Two Japanese rovers (planetary boats) were able to extract unique images from the Hayabusa-2 probe.
Basta's name was attributed to Baste for the falcon of the FM 2018 stadium.
The damage to the football lawn at the Rostov-on-Don stadium was linked to a concert by Russian rapper Vasily Vakulenko, or Basta.
Photo published on Instagram account hd7tv.
"We're very good with Basta and his creativity, but... I'm sorry about the lawn," says the signature to the photos.
The comments allege that grass near the edge of the field was damaged by the protective coating (special tiles).
The concert, scheduled for 29 September, was never cancelled.
The Rostov Football Club, as well as the Russian Premier League, opposed the concert.
“I want to know the names of those football players and Rostov representatives who claim that my performance could be detrimental, interfere with the activities and development of the football club, and affect the performance of its players,” Basta wrote in response to criticism.
Rostov Arena is one of the stadiums of the 2018 World Cup.
Five matches were held at the tournament.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon."
Wakhtang Kikabidze on cancer control
Many artists now talk about how they managed to cope with oncology.
Unfortunately, the disease spares no one, and the stories of popular people about winning cancer give hope to many.
Famous actor Wahtang Kikabidze confessed that he was only alive because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a judgment.
"I feel like I've been hit in the skull with a hammer.
I fell.
He's lost his orientation.
They put him in the hospital.
I couldn't hold a spoon, I couldn't stand, I fell all the time.
Started running tests, turns out it's a bad thing, the artery doesn't bleed.
They brought me to Moscow, they said I had a big pus cyst in my head, and they had an emergency surgery.
And during the surgery, doctors behind the brush saw a tumor," told Kikabidze in "One Day."
The tumor was malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to bid farewell to the idol at his house.
But the actor's wife wouldn't allow her to bury a live actor, she believed she could cope with the disease, and she hadn't left her beloved husband's bed for over a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Every time I had a crisis, she was there like a rock," the actor confessed.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, and now lives happily in his home in downtown Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumours of his illness, the untimely death that appears on the Web all the time.
The creators of the Mirosurets site added Peter Sillarto, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, to the section “Purgatory”.
The reason was “an attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of neighbouring countries has been found to be “direct threats of invasion of Ukraine” and “support for separatist sentiment in Ukraine”, as well as to participate “in organizing provocation aimed at massive violations by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian law”.
We note that in front of Sillarto in Purgatory, the deputy of Kiev-Pecherskaya, Pavel, and the future of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) Onufrieus, were pleased.
Their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian Local Church was due to their opposition.
Earlier, in commenting on the issue of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatya, Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine ' s sovereign rights.
The authorities have named the sum of the "gold parachute" of the crow's governor.
A one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronezh region, Yuri Aguivalov, was made under the Regional Public Service Act.
However, the real amount of the gold parachute of the freed Vrio official was several times less than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations were provided by the regional government press service.
According to the law, Aguigalov's salary is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, it was emphasized in the press service that the lump sum was 223,892 roubles less income tax, rather than the 1 million roubles reported by the media.
The official received an old-age pension from July 2018.
He has served in public office for more than nine years.
The pension and the lump-sum payment are made immediately upon dismissal from office and explained to RIA Novosti in the Regional Government.
However, Aguivalov ' s pension supplement was suspended when he was appointed to public office, and his salary remained the same as in the previous period.
The Governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, who won the governor's election, took office on 15 September.
Aguibalov was relieved of his post because of the expiry of the term of office of the Vrio of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region have ended.
On 29 September, the Telegram channel Nezygari published documents showing that Agibalowa, who had resigned from his post as Lieutenant Governor, had been paid a termination indemnity of 23 salaries, and two days later he was again given a similar post without a Vrio.
The deputy of the State Duma called for students to be told about the harm of masturbation.
Onishchenko is the first Vice-Chairman of the Education and Science Committee.
Based on his work experience, he pointed out in an interview that teenagers were provoking harmful information that they found on the Internet to masturbate.
This is being fought at the level of educational institutions and the family, and the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with Radio Moscow:
As part of the general sex education of children, this should be done by explaining the damage, because there is a risk to the sexual health of the child, both male and female.
The problem is objective, it is that children mature early enough, and then there are large scissors between their sexual maturity and their ability to enter into formal contact between the sexes.
According to Onišchenko, the problem is hampered by “scrupulousness”, silence about “the problem of sexual age” and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers are facing onism.
The Deputy believes that the first thing to do is to teach lessons about the harm of Onanism in schools in the “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we will simply not be understood, to put it mildly," said the professor.
Gennady Onishchenko is an active academic of RAMM, member of the Presidium of RAMM, doctor of medical sciences, professor.
Earned doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the Presidium of the Russian-wide public health organization “The Health League of the Nation”.
The families of the victims in Izmajlovsky will help with the Warm Network.

The family was told about this in the company immediately after the tragedy.
Remember, the pipe burst in the yard of the house on Izmajlovsk prospectus on 28 September.
As a result of the tragedy, several cars fell under the asphalt, and two young people died locally from burns.
It became the second most popular in Germany.
An anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings fall.
It appears that German citizens have become seriously tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most notably, recent questions suggest that the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming more popular and that the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Zeehofer are weakening.
This week, the ADG broke another record, peaking at number two in the popular sympathies ranking.
Right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent popularity, managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The one percentage point gap could be written off as statistical error, but it should be noted that the ADG, created in 2013 from a small group of Euroceptic economists, had become a major political force.
For the time being, the ruling HSS/HDS block, which has about 30 per cent, continues to hold the leadership in total.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - as early as April, support for Angela Merkel’s bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal ranking of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans are supporting Angela Merkel, a 7 per cent decrease from last year.
Add that the Social Democrats were followed by “green” (15 per cent), left (11 per cent) and liberals (10 per cent).
Evolution of Alternatives
The Alternative for Germany was formed in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The Group had initially been in opposition to government policy, but had initially dealt only with economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
In doing so, the group opposed Germany's “sounding” of weak EU economies, and did not exclude the possibility of returning to the German mark and fully withdrawing the country from the EU.
Against the background of the deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of the ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took over the niche of the Euroskeptics and began harshly criticizing the government for failing immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AdG was able to break through the Bundestag for the first time with 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternative for Germany won seats in the European Parliament.
A video of a journalist calling Ukrainian citizens the "dump-off nation" was published.
The host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books, Ostap Drosdov, made a live confession that he considered his compatriots a "nation of fools".
They believe the TV and they don't read much.
As Drosdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood”, the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Television and Radio Broadcasting Committee began to fight against literature that contained the slightest hints of criticism of the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the importation of even 201 publications.
Manchester City played Brighton and became an APL leader.

On the next tour, Josep Guardiola's wards will play Liverpool on October 7th, and the Cheicks will take West Ham two days earlier.
Canadians built a car for the apocalypse, a magazine behind the wheel.
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Roshel Defence Solutions has stated that it is already accepting applications for its new armored car.
Rochel Senator APC Apocalypse Armor
On the subject of the apocalypse, it is not just video game producers, film studios, and book publishers that make money.
Now the automobile companies are also developing a new niche for themselves.
For example, the Canadian Rochel Defence Solutions introduced its APC Senator Apocalypse armor.
In a fantasy-free time, the company's engineers are making armoured vehicles for the police.
The Rosel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who are not particularly comfortable, but are perfectly safe in a single-hull armoured vehicle.
This bunker, otherwise you can't call it a design, because its booking level is B7-standard, installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, can protect the capsule from the explosion of grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Rochel Senator APC Armoured Armoured Apocalypse
In order not to cause damage to passengers, even an explosive wave from a bomb that exploded near the vehicle, the car compartment is equipped with special amortizing chairs.
The capsule also has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
For safe viewing, the Rochel Senator APC is equipped with a night vision camera system, as well as an observation tower on the roof.
There's no gun in the car.
Rochel Senator APC Armoured Armoured Apocalypse Front
To ensure that the weight of the armoured vehicle does not affect the mobility of the vehicle, the Rochel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong, resistant turbodiesel engine of 6.7 litres, the full power of which is transmitted to the four wheels of the armoured vehicle through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
There's no chance of getting stuck in the Rossel Senator APC armored apocalypse.
A special exhibition in Washington, D.C., will be held in October to see the Rossel Senator APC armoret.
The time of death of the universe has been set
The universe will last approximately 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observed world of about 13.8 billion years.
A study of the international scientific community is posted in the ArXiv.org e-preprint library and directed to publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
The experts came to similar conclusions by observing with the HSC (Hyper Superime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope about 10 million galaxies.
After tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 per cent of the world's observed energy masses, scientists, working under the standard cosmological model .CDM () Cold Dark Matter, estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
The press release of the Subaru Observatory states that observations have produced a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, while the recording of data from the European Space Telescope Planck has clarified the limitations placed on the parameters of .CDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible destruction of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the world under observation would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap.
Another attempt to unify the proponents of the pension referendum failed.
The opportunity to get the people's views on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
On Saturday in Moscow, a general federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age met.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups, which recorded different wordings of the questions (all five were registered by the Centre).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians: "Do you want the retirement age established by the pension law as of 1 July 2018 to be raised when citizens of Russia are entitled to an old-age pension?"
This language was registered by a water sub-group whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and most legally comprehensive.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of the Justice Russia member Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the CRCF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups, from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg, joined them.
Swiridov had previously said to “Victomy” that invitations had been sent to all initiators and some 40 sub-groups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, the head of the water sub-group (which was supported by 15 other sub-groups), said to Vedomos that she had not received an invitation or planned to come: “We did not understand who was a friend and who was an enemy”.
The blues singer Otis Rush died.
At the age of 84, a famous Chicago blues guitarist and singer, Otis Rush, died, citing his manager, Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following a stroke in 2003.
Mr. Rush's creativity influenced musicians like Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.
It was widely known in 1956 after the release of "I Can't Quick You Baby", which peaked at number six on the "Billboard" R&B.
Admiral's caused us a lot of trouble.
Zinetula Bilaltdinov: "Admiral" has caused us great problems.
The head coach of Ak Barsa, Zinetula Bilaleddinov, summarized the results of the regular KHL championship against Admiral (4:2).
"It wasn't a simple game, it was complicated.
The rival fought well, caused us great problems.
I'm glad we played pretty well today.
I've told you before, the goals will come, as long as we work on it.
And that we won, too, is very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this series?"
"We have our own program that he works on.
That's why it was a decision," quotes Bilyaletdin's press service at the club.
Elon Musk will be leaving the board of directors of Tesla.
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk will have to leave the board of directors of Tesla and pay a $20 million fine.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the position of CEO of the company, reporting to AFP with a reference to the regulator's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
Previously, the regulator had sued Ilon Musk - officials thought he had misled Tesla investors because the businessman had allowed all the company's shares to be purchased at a high price of $420 per paper.
In the Loko-Achmat match, Turbine's mistakes fell like a horn of abundance.
Vladimir Levitin, a former union judge, commented on the work of Arbitrator Evgeny Turbin in the ninth round of Russia's Locomotive-Achmat Championship and dealt with controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate Evgeny Turbin's judgment in the Locomotive-Achmat match?
- I believe that this arbiter has confirmed his unsuitability for the trial of the Russian Premier League.
I'm surprised that the pressure of the fifth Spartacus tour meeting, Dinamo, neither Turbin himself nor the DSI leaders made serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private absenteeisms of gross gestures were plunging out of the horn of abundance.
For example, for the 50th minute, the railman Eder is carrying his hands in his punishment area, the Akhmat’s protector, Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't make a penalty.
- How do you rate the episode involving Idova, who was at the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball hit him in the arm?
- I believe there was a deliberate play with the protector's hand in his punishment square.
The Turbin was right next to the moment, seeing the episode well and his first assistant on the right.
The reserve judge, Sergei Karasev, should have seen this point.
Nevertheless, all three were asleep, and the penalty was not imposed.
So the score in the match was distorted, and sports justice was violated.
It was the same time that the judgeship replaced and buried the sports spirit of the game.
At the 52nd minute, Turbin refused to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against the Crimea, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he gave him a big round of applause.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have shown you the second mustard?
At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card didn't exactly show up on business.
The second would be illogical.
Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards in the judiciary that some teams are being punished for violations like the Idova episode, and some of them aren't.
What does a footballer say?
- Depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give it.
So the arbiter doesn't give a second penalty at the opposite gate.
Here's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge is watching who's playing.
I was playing Locomotive on Saturday and Achmat had serious concerns about Turbin's work because the team was compromised.
Matt Damon played the accused rape judge Cavanaugh at the SNL launch.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the Supreme Court of the United States of America, Brett Cavanaugh, who is charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new season's "Saturday Night Live" on NBC.
During a little sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at a Senate hearing on the charge of rape.
The U.S. Supreme Court candidate had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailed stories in an interview with Senator Amy Clobuchard.
For example, Cavanaugh repeatedly confessed to his love of beer, but stated that he had never been drunk without any memory.
In addition, in an attempt to justify the rape charge, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
Damon also played those points.
All I did was drink a lot and not think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows that," said the judge in the execution of Matt Damon.
Cavanaugh had previously been elected supreme judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found strange behavior in her cloned dogs.
American singer Barbra Streisand stated that the clones of her dead dog behave in a very different way than the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it's impossible to clone the soul," said a 76-year-old singer.
In late 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old Coton de Toulear dog, named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua dog called Miracle Milly, the world's smallest dog, had been cloned for the 49th time.
Experts clone a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The US is thinking about Russia’s naval blockade over oil and gas supplies.
In the US, Russia’s naval blockade could take advantage of the world’s energy market.
The United States authorities have been so eager to fight for success in the world’s hydrocarbon market that they are prepared to resort to Russia’s naval blockade, which remains one of the world’s major energy suppliers.
Ryan Zinke, head of the U.S. Department of Internal Affairs, spoke about the possibility of a sea blockade the previous day.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior did not perform police functions, but civilian functions, including natural resource policies.
Zinke ' s statement therefore came within the competence of his department, although it was not devoid of political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zink stated that, thanks to the US Navy, shipping routes in the Middle East region were controlled and could be blocked if necessary.
Zinke’s words suggested that the need might be linked to Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supply to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive the lion's share of its revenues from oil and gas supplies to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, just as in Eastern Europe, was the main motive for Moscow’s revitalization in the region, I am sure, Zinke.
The Secretary of State has made it clear that the US still expects to lead the world’s energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the sea blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure along this path, Zinke believes.
Kalmytsky's director got good reviews of the festival.
Our countryman, the actor of Gogol Center, Evgeny Sangajiev, and his film "Harmony" received special mention of the members of the jury of the sixth debut festival, "Movement", which was held in Omsk.
The name of the festival diploma says, "It's a signal for the immediate response of major industrial film players."
As is well known, the picture of a young Kalmac director was featured in the short film program "Movement: Start", where eight films were featured.
The main prize in this competition program was "Jana - It's Anja - Inverse" - the director's debut of actress Jana Slutch.
The focus of the National Film Festival of debuts is on young films, but not on the age of the producers, but on their spirit, willingness and ability to take risks.
And the graduate of the P. Chong Kushov and RATI-GITIS School of Art, Yevgeny Sangajiev, meets all these requirements.
He is young, talented, creative, and creatively seeks new and innovative forms of expression.

Previously, the Syrian opposition, commenting on the resumption of rocket and bomb attacks on areas in northern Syria, stated that Moscow and Damascus had launched a military “torture” operation against Idlib.
The islanders are urged to get shot quickly - MK Sahalin
In the Sahel region, a campaign is under way to immunize the population against influenza.
Health professionals in the island region call on residents to be more active and not to ignore doctors’ recommendations.
This year, 219,000 people in the region are to be immunized, including at least 70 per cent of all children.
To date, 49,000 Sahelians and smokers have been vaccinated.
At the South Sahalin children’s health centre, more than 10,000 visitors attended the procedure.
According to medical experts, children of six months' age, transport workers, educational and health personnel and those most likely to be in contact with a large number of people are at greatest risk of “capture” the disease.
All of them can get a free flu shot.
Nor do people with chronic illnesses, pregnant women, and students pay for injections.

Supersonic passenger aircraft in the Russian Federation will be placed in serial production
Serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
The Director-General of the Zhukovski Central Aerodynamic Institute, Kiril Sipalo, stated this.
He said that the scientific centre was working on supersonic topics both in international consortia and in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry.
“We feel it will take us two to three years to get a technology demonstrationer, as well as another 10 to 15 years to get a serial machine to transport across our homeland,” Sipalo added.
He clarified that the question now before Russian experts was how to make technology cost-effective and safe at the same time.
At the beginning of September, the PAO aircraft developer, Tupolev, announced the completion of pre-project work on a supersonic passenger aircraft, which is estimated to reach a speed of 1,900 km/h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was reported by the Deputy Director-General of Valery Solozobov's company.
Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for making Ukraine more European.
He announced this on CNN.
He stated that he could only confirm the words of the Washington Post that Putin’s aggression against Ukraine had resulted in Ukrainian unification.
“In 2013, the transatlantic integration of Ukraine, and NATO membership, supported 16% of Ukrainians.
That's over 54% now.
Who did this?
Putin.
In 2013, Ukraine ' s European integration and accession to the EU supported 33 per cent of Ukrainians.
It's 74% now.
Who did this?
Putin," said Poroshenko.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more willing to defend European values and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely certain that we will not return to the Russian Empire,” the President of Ukraine stressed.
In late September 2018, President Peter Poroshenko was in the United States and participated in the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
He also visited the grave of a great friend of Ukraine, Senator John McCain of the United States (1987-2018).

Formula 1 Russia’s Grand Prix
There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former captain of Chelsea and England team John Terry, about why he attended the ninth round of the Russia Spartacus Championship - "Rostov" (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club that I'm following.
I've been following him quite recently, and I was interested in seeing him from the outside.
I can't say that I'm a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize again for the decision, quotes Terry from Chelsea's fans' website.
Remember, "Rostov" with 18 points peaked at number three in the tournament table, and "Spartacus" was placed on number five with 15 points.
On the next tour, the red-and-whites will play with Enise on October 7th, and the wards of Valery Karpin will take the Orenburg the day before.
Dear violin sold into a pawn shop for nothing.
When in the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a man brought a violin for an old and unrepresentative tool, the pawnshop offered only $50.
But Dylan McDermitt's experienced shop manager suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and he sought expert advice.
It turns out that the violin was manufactured in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinando Gallano and is estimated at $250,000.
The only links to the violin are estimated at $16,000 to $18,000.
The investigation revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from a resident of the city, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the man who put it in the pawnshop, but there are no previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now everyone bringing in a pawnshop violin will be asked to play it to make sure it actually belongs to the client.
On the ninth round of the RPL, we face an exciting stand-off: Spartacus will receive at its stadium in Tushin “Rostov” under the leadership of Valery Karpin, a man known to be no stranger to the “people's team”.
The particular spicyness of this meeting is that the clubs now have an equal number of 15 points, and they share 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, falling behind from the far-fetched Zenitha and being in one spot with the Reddar playing with the Dynamo tomorrow.
The red-and-whites now have a rough patch: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly flew in the Rapida, and recently ceded to Ahmatu's home.
After the Derby with the CSKA, which ended with a fair tie, Spartacus played the Black Sea Cup with a minimum score, and it is too early to tell whether Russia's most popular club is approaching the end of the crisis.
Rostov couldn't win three games in a row, but he doesn't know the loss of five games.
Let's see if Karpin can extend the win-win series in such a principled match.
The previous meeting of the Karpin Rostov with Spartacus ended in favour of the Metropolitan Command.
It starts at 7:00.
Indonesia is shaken by aftershocks after a massive tsunami
In Indonesia, where an earthquake occurred a few days ago, causing a three - metre tsunami, meteorologists observe more than 170 aftershocks.
The magnetuda was 7.4, and most of it affected Sulawesi Island, reports Roscia 24.
Over 420 people were killed and more than 500 injured.
The authorities informed the population of the tsunami threat in advance, but later cancelled it.
The thing is, the instruments didn't detect the wave approaching.
The fate of dozens of other residents who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday at one of the coastal towns of Palu, which was most devastated after the storm, is still unknown.
London has made accusations against Moscow.
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, as British Defence Minister Gavin Williamson has stated.
But England will defend its values, he emphasized at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threat is increasing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, and enemies are operating in grey areas through cyberattacks and false news, added the minister.
But the biggest one is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians have been repeatedly refuted by Moscow, which transmits to TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, reported that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not abide by international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned a story of poisoning in the English city of Salisbury last March, ex-Colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum is being held on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighbouring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a keen supporter of the Republic's renaming of Northern Macedonia, was one of the first to vote.
Preparations for the referendum and today ' s voting are monitored by international organizations.
The head of the monitoring mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers was organized:
Approximately 100 teams have travelled across the country to observe the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closing, then the counting of votes and the writing of records.
For a month, there were 10 teams in the country that monitored the preparation for the vote, the media, the implementation of the electoral campaign financing law and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgeri: "About 500 foreign observers are watching the voting closely.
The observation teams shall record the details of the situation and shall communicate with the members of the electoral commissions in order to present them in the final report.”
The translator compared the Russian-German mentality
The mentalities of the Russian and German peoples vary, but the few differences between them do not play a great role in mutual understanding.
On International Interpreter Day, 30 September, Barbel Sachs, a professional synchronist, spoke of this.
She has been involved in translation from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan things calmly, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "have a long time, let's go fast."
But I don't think it's important to understand people and to work as an interpreter, says a specialist in RIA News.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries need each other, "it's enough to know history."
And in the future, she pointed out that Germany doesn't make sense to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are a lot of things that determine our common destiny," she said.
The previous day, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had stated that the country was trying to “establish relations” with Russia and maintain them.
She said that Mania's North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which was built from the Russian coast to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, was particularly important to Berlin.

The last day of September was marked by low air temperatures in Ukraine, offset by a bright sun.
Natalia Didenko wrote on Facebook about this.
She said that this dry and cool weather had brought an anti-cyclone tom, who would continue to determine temperature on Monday, 1 October.
On average, 13 to 17 degrees of heat are expected in Ukraine during the day of 1 October, 17 to 22 degrees in the south and in Zakarpatya.

The temperature will be between 2 and 5 degrees of heat at night and 12 and 15 degrees with a plus mark during the day.
“It was cold at night, not honey the next night, but I hope the sunshine compensates for the home-made pants with hair and such early evening puddocks,” Didenko commented on her prediction, congratulating the Ukrainians on their celebration of the holy day of faith, hope, love, and the mother of their Sofia.
Let us recall that the previous nights were marked by freezing on the ground in the western and northern regions of Ukraine, as well as in the Vinnice region.
Putin has appointed a new Head of the Foreign Policy Office of the President
Vladimir Putin, by decree, dismissed Alexander Manjosin as the head of the foreign policy office of the President.
Igor Neverov has been appointed to replace him.
Mr. Manjosin has been in charge of the President's Foreign Policy Office since 2004.
As one of the reasons for his departure, a source close to the Kremlin, IO, cited personal circumstances, noting that there were no significant claims to the head of the department in terms of quality of work.
Igor Neverov was formerly head of the Second European Department of Mida.
In 2009-2014, he was Russia's ambassador to Sweden.
Russians donated one ruble to a low-wage deputy
In Yekaterinburg, the charitable foundation “Man” opened a fundraiser for a member of the State Duma, Vera Ganzi, who complained of low wages.
The campaign can be traced on the organization's website.
"The Human Foundation expresses the hope that the world will be able to save the servant of the people.
We ask all concerned people to give them a chance to live and have a happy future!
All funds collected will be transferred personally to the poor.
God save you!" says the letter from the foundation.
All the philanthropists want to collect 380,000 rubles for the deputy, which is equivalent to a month's salary.
Reports of the assistance received are published on the fund's VKontakte page, where the organizers provide screenshots of remittances.
The most frequent donations are one ruble and 50 kopecks.
At the time of publication, Russians had donated 1,633 roubles to Vera Ganza.
The fund-raising was opened on 28 September following Ganzi ' s low-income complaint.
According to her, the average salary of a deputy was 380,000 rubles, which left nothing to do with it, so it was necessary to spend money from a credit card.
Ganzia complained that parliamentarians were not reimbursed for representation costs.
Subsequently, the State Duma stated that it would consider the possibility of paying representation costs to the deputies.
"Golden sink" festival in San Sebastian received the film "The Two Seas"
The painting "Entre dos aguas" by Spanish director Isaki Lacuesta is the best film of the 66th International Film Festival in San Sebastian.
The band won the main award of the festival, the Golden sink.

The best actor was named Argentinian Dario Grandinetti for the film "Rose" (Rojo).
The director of the same film, Benjamin Ny State, was awarded the title of best director.
The Comedy Night School is headed by an American box office.
The Comedy Night School, which debuted at American cinemas last Friday, earned $28 million in rent for its first weekend.
This result allowed Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the U.S. box office from 28 to 30 September.
In the international market, a film released so far in only 20 countries collected $5.5 million, including 2 million British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line of Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable, has pretty much outpaced another new Western rental, the "Smolfoot" cartoon, the curious story of meeting a charming yeti with a human species whose existence the main hero never believed.
The project by director Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig collected $23 million over his start-up weekend, largely meeting the expectations of experts who predicted 20-25 million for the weekend.
With regard to the sum of "Smolfoot" fees, they currently amount to $38.6 million (which has already debuted in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active, adding 3.6 million dollars to the film.
This time, three of the strongest were shut down by a children's story called "The Mystery of the House with the Watch" from the horror master Eli Roth, who finally proved that the director can make a good movie for audience 12+.
In its second week, the filming of John Bellers' book with the charming Jack Black with Kate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing the global total to 53.8 million.
Despite the departure from top three, it continues to be surprising with the "+" sign the thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick's "Simple Request": in 17 days in American rental, Paul Fig's painting, from which some unrealistic financial performance was initially not expected from the word "all," raised $43 million (including 6.6 million for 28-30 October) and right now has 62.9 million total revenues.
The last representative of the first five this week was the horror of the nun's curse, which gathered $5.4 million over the reporting period.
The spin-off of the spell, after 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas, has $330 million in total earnings and has recently been proud of being the most successful franchise film, which also includes two parts of the spell itself and two ribbons of Annabel's creepy doll.
Right after Corinne Hardy's horror story, the last weekend left another member of the genre, debutante Hellfest, one of the major youth horrors of the year.
During his first weekend, Gregory Plotkin, a famous editor (and recent director), who had worked in a number of large chororor projects, including "Happy Day of Death", which Hallfest is very similar to, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is very positive.
The seventh was "The Madly Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which seems to have no intention of falling out of the top 10 American boxers: the romantic comedy that has been on the screen for the seventh week, was the sixth highest-rated tape in the history of September, with a figure of 165.7 million.
This is the same amount that has so far been produced on the domestic market, with a total revenue of $218.8 million.
With regard to the last three lucky ones in the US top ten for 28-30 September, they were the Predator, the White Guy Rick, and the... the Hamre Mint, which earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million and $1.1 million, respectively, over the past weekend.
Let's add that next weekend in the United States will be gathering the long-awaited Vienna with Tom Hardy, who, without any doubt, will take over the leadership of the American box office after the first weekend of October.
Of the other premieres of the coming week, one should highlight the musical melodrama "Star Born", the recipient of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hate".
The head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs paid tribute to the victims of Nazism in Italy
In Mardzatto, in northern Italy, there was a commemoration of the victims of the Nazi repression, in which some 770 people were killed in September and October 1944.
Most of them are women and children.
This year, the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Heiko Maas, participated in the ceremony.
He said that "deep sorrow and great shame" bowed before the victims of the murder and their families.

His Italian colleague, Enzo Moavero-Milanesi, arrived with the German Minister in Mardzatto.
The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stresses that for the first time, the heads of foreign policy departments participate together in the ceremony, which symbolizes the desire of both countries to preserve the memory of the crimes of the past.

Valery Belov: God helped Siberia today.
The head coach of Vitjazia, Valery Belov, is about the defeat of Siberia (3:4) in a regular KHL championship.
"The College was talking about Siberia fans, and I want to celebrate our fans," says Belov's official website, Vitjaja.
"I hope they'll support you, too, because now almost every game is full of stadiums, great atmosphere.
In the game, perhaps God helped Siberia today, because they were grossly wrong, especially our leaders.
Our leading leaders lost the entire micro-ball game, so it was hard for us to pull out this match, even though there were moments.
But still, I'll take the fall for it.
Because I guess we missed something in preparation.
It was a different team compared to the last match."
"It's an ugly nepotism."
The audience resents Agutin's choice on Voice.
The audience of Voice 60+ accuses mentor Leonid Agutin of "dirty nepotism and daring."
When he first learned the voice of his father, Nikolai Agutin, in blind auditions, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But the feelings of the sons prevailed, and he chose a relative for his team.
At that time, many considered it a joke, but pardoned the mentor’s partiality in the first stage.
But the joke took a long time, and the star's father took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is no longer prepared to forgive Agutina such injustice.
Yesterday, as the audience of the show, we were outraged by the nepotism and frankness of dragging our close relatives to the final ladder.
I had even doubted that Agutina would have the strength and the conscience not to drag his father to his first place until the end,” Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larina argued on TV Man.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "sall" the beautiful performers who really sang while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wanted to see his father on the show.
But, as it turns out, that's not the case, the audience wants an objective assessment, and they want to see really talented performers in the finals, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I'm sorry to hear about the Golos from the Agutin team. They were doomed."
"Agutin showed him how much he loved Dad last time, and he was supposed to be a professional today."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"Delete two talented people from the project and leave in the project his dad who doesn't sing but whispers, how can you then call a mentor?"
"I like the way Dad sings, give him a concert at the Kremlin for your money and see how many people come to this concert."
It's "Voice," not "Cool Relatives."
"It was unprofessional from Agutin's side."
"Then you have to ask your dad on your own show, not on a show that's made for Channel 1 money."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other player with real vocal data.
Why did a worker from Surgut with a great voice and a timbre leak, and Dad Agutin was driven to the finale?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on stage and on screen for decades!
Because you can't get through the nepotism!"
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
There's blat and nepotism all around.
And the money in the family's budget will be worth it!
Theater of absurdity continues!"
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voices, the son of Gradsky appeared in blind auditions.
That's when it never occurred to me to take my son on my own team.
In fact, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all clear."
Agutin couldn't do what a professional did.
Military Canada is allowed to wear beards to raise the spirit
Defense Canada has issued an order that allows military personnel to wear beards.
According to CBC, the bill contains instructions on beard care.
It is noted that the military may be ordered to shave for “security reasons”.

The innovation is expected to “enhanced morale in the army and attract more Canadians to the service”.
The ban on wearing a beard has been in force in the Canadian army since the Second World War.
It was previously reported that police officers in France were also allowed to wear beards and even have tattoos.
At the same time, the Egyptian court upheld the suspension of police officers wearing beards.

In central Kiev, a robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from an ATM.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 September in Ivan Kudri Street, and was reported by the capital law enforcement.
According to the victim, an unknown person approached him and engaged in a conversation, but then suddenly grabbed the knife and demanded that the money and the mobile phone be given to him.
Since the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered the money off the bank card.
After the attacker received 4,000 hryvnias and a telephone, he hit the victim and fled”, the report states.
The law enforcement officers managed to apprehend the robber, and they turned out to be a 25-year-old kielvanan.

The scientist described a possible scientific programme of the FM mission to the Moon
The head of the Institute for Space Research of the Republic of Armenia, an associate member of the Republic of Armenia, Anatoli Petrukovich, told RIA News about a possible research programme for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was in the process of developing guidelines for such work.
“There is not yet a consolidated opinion,” said the scientist.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the Moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place such a telescope could be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," added Petrukovich.
He also believes that the Moon could be used to test robotics, to use local resources for construction.
Moreover, cosmonauts should be called upon to search for primitive organics on Earth’s satellite, a scientist considers.
This could help us to determine how life appears on the planets.
The head of Roscosmos had previously said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation, a manned flight to the Moon could take place by 2030.
The offended client threw away a basket of feces at 7-Eleven.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, who is known as "deviled a tooth" on the manager of a 24-hour network store 7-Eleven: in May, he kicked him out of the store for misbehaviour.
So I decided to take revenge on my enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the night, he went into the store and threw the baskets on the floor and on some of the items on the shelves.
The basket contained feces and urine that Simms borrowed from a nearby mobile biotual.
The police officers who arrived on the scene arrested the vigilante.
He was put in prison and released on bail at $300.
He was charged with unlawful entry into other people ' s property and criminal offence, and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although the crime of Simms appears to be more ridiculous than serious, the sentence may be severe, as it has violated the law repeatedly in the past, with large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, drinking and driving, and animal abuse.

He was a former employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who is currently an agent of one of Ukraine's insurance companies.
According to the Press Centre of the AS, the detainee explained that the vehicle had been wanted by Interpol since 2014, and was therefore detained in Russian territory and handed over to him as a representative of the insurance company.
When crossing the Ukrainian-Russian border, he removed the fake license plates, but at the entrance to Kiev he re-established them.

In order to address this issue, the Minister believes that there are two options: military and economic.
He would prefer not to use it first, so it was necessary to exert pressure and displace Iranian energy resources.

There was nothing I could do, and it was very painful.
Sergei Sirotkin: There was nothing I could do, and it was very painful.
Russian pilot Sergei Sirotkin commented on the results of the Russian Grand Prix race.
"To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner, I ended up between two cars that were pinned on me right away.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
Turned out to be in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We were hoping after the rest of us hit the pit stop, we'd get into the clean air, and we'd get back to the pace, but the rubber was gone.
Plus fighting his partner, he had contact with him, too.
I take it he made a little mistake.
We were in this situation on the most uncarried highway of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Sirotkin RIA, "The News."
Remember that Sirotkin finished the 18th race at the Russian Grand Prix, and the winner was Lewis Hamilton, the British pilot of Mercedes.
Tarpishev called it absurd to remove Glugkov and Ponko from the foundation of Spartacus.
The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTR), Shamil Tarpishchev, commented on the exclusion of football players Denis Glugkov and Andrei Phonko from training with the main staff after a reference to the criticism of Massimo Carrera's head coach, reports Sport Weekend.
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
It's a stupid thing to pay attention to.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the team's rift.
First of all, it's poetry, read and understand it as much as you want.
If I were Carrera, I wouldn't have reacted.
Everyone has an opinion.
Second, everyone wants to bury themselves.
If Glutkov and Ponko put on likes, it doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian doesn't have the flexibility to see the situation.
And that doesn't serve the team's normal climate.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so there's no need to inflate the situation.
Maybe you should have laughed at it together.
Spartacus has a lot on different lines, and there's a lot of irregularity after the introduction of young people.
Relations within the team do not seem to add optimism before this match," I'm sure Tarpishchev.
The two teams will play on September 30 and begin at 7 p.m. Moscow time.
Previously, John Terry, who refused Spartacus, led the Chelsea Youth Team.
Cirius' students have discussed natural technologies with scientists.
Students of the Sirius educational centre in Sochi, participants of the School of Agribiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the National Research Centre “Kurchatov Institute”.
The researcher's presentation was part of the Global International Forum of Convergence and Naturelike Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and is reported on the website of the educational centre on 29 September.
The lecture opened a documentary film entitled “Kurchatov's Codes”, in which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, a correspondent member of RNA, Mikhail Kowalchuk, described global challenges as driving civilization.
The scholar's lecture is published on Sirius' website.
The students learned that modern technology requires a great deal of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to produce such quantities.
The forum’s organizers have said that natural technology, which young scientists are working on today, will help to solve this problem.
Kowalchuk also raised the issue of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies and the risks inherent in the development of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a huge benefit.
It's the explosive growth of medical technology, it's the improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of nature-like technologies is, in fact, the technological replication of wildlife systems.
There's the other side-- deliberate interference with human activity.
There are always risks.
A car showed up and people were dying under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I'm creating a new medical technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," quotes scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the audience.
Speakers were Yulia Diakova, candidate for physico-mathematical science, head of the Kurchatov NBICS Natural Technology Complex, INC "Kurchatov Institute" and Viacheslav Demin, head of the Kurchatov IBX Technology Complex.
The Sirius educational centre in Sochi was established by the Talant and Success Education Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure on the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the educational centre is to identify, develop and further professional support gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online Olympics on information security “Kibervoz” would be sent to study at Sirius.

Macedonia: The referendum was not held due to low attendance
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country “North Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of their historic province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav Republic the opening of a route to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to EFE, only 34 percent of Sunday's plebiscite appearance "did not reach the constitutional threshold of 50 percent.

Kemerochan outraged the flock of sheep in the cemetery.
On September 30, the famous Kemerova page on the social network reported from an eyewitness that horned animals were walking freely in one of the local cemeteries.
Animals of a large flock walked between the fences and pinched the grass.
Commentators expressed different views: some local residents noted that there was no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery and their appetite could even help clear the area of weeds and grasses, but some of the city ' s inhabitants did not enjoy animal behaviour:
"It's graves, not pastures.
You don't have to do that.
Of course you can't say they're blasphemous, but it's not a matter of the sheep."
In one way or another, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery was already known and that the necessary measures would soon be taken.
What's the right thing to do?
There's no such thing as pressure.
That's right, let's do it.
The word "press" in the meaning of "strength, influence, influence" only exists phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "satisfaction".
We use that word to assume that it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "satisfaction" aren't exactly close, but even in some sense opposite.
See for yourself.
"Satisfying" means "satisfying, full, sufficient, sufficient for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
Satisfying, pleasure, related words.
He used to have the meaning of "not depending on anything, being self-fulfilling" - "satisfying."
The old Slavic "devil" is related to the words "lead" and "will."
Pressure, suppression, it's completely different.
These words are really scary "relatives": daos - "wolf," deyja - "death" and dvaid" - "harass."
A similar phonetic form of pressure and satisfaction, as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter the contamination.
So we've got this "yes" thing that's used through "a" on the letter, which is, well, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of creating and developing these words.
All right, that's right, let's do it.
But it's an outdated word, in its proper sense, no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you, use the word "press."
You can also use the pressure design, but remember, it's cancellitis.

It will be interesting to watch his performances next year," quotes Aleshin SMP Racing.

through an operation in Syria, Russia has shielded itself from terrorists
In the course of three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of which 85,000 have killed Russian air and space forces.
This was explained on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Russian military operation in Syria by former head of the SCC, Victor Bondarev, head of the Federation Council for Defence and Security.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of aerial weapons: air and space forces had attacked and continued to attack terrorist targets precisely.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist targets had been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition depots, reinforced areas and headquarters.
Russian air strikes broke into jihadist defenses, making a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syria's government forces, handing over Interfax.
However, according to Bondarev, our military operation in Syria has made it possible to shield Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IG, banned in Russia) and Jebhat al-Nusru (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, some 4,000 Russian fighters and about 5,000 citizens of the post-Soviet countries fought on the side of the Islamic Republic of Iran, transferring TASS.
It is only the registered individuals, apart from those who have not been identified, who have emphasized Bondarev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter freely into our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant borders - otherwise, it would be evil to us.
The phones of Boris Johnson and a number of British ministers have been made publicly available.

According to the network, a number of politicians have received "unpleasant calls."
The technical problem has been solved, and the application is now safe to use.
We're looking into the reasons for the breakdown and apologize for any problems caused," said the Conservative Party.
During the crash, users were able not only to see confidential data, but also to edit information in the profiles of politicians and journalists.
For example, in the profile of the Minister of the Environment, Ecology and Agriculture, Michael Gow was replaced by a photo of Rupert Murdock's media platform.
Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism
Syrian MFA leader Walid Muallem accused the US and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas targeted, and massacred civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law," he said.
According to Muallem, the US and its partners have provided “direct support to the terrorists” because the objectives of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria were and meant to be “the sowing of chaos, death and destruction in their path”.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria was almost complete and that the country had become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intended to rid Syria of the illegal foreign presence, and that priority would be given to the Syrian partners in rebuilding the country.
In September, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, head of the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Warring Parties in the Republic, stated that two United States F-15 aircraft had attacked the Syrian province of Deir al-Zawr with prohibited phosphorus.
The U.S. rejected all charges.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, believes that, while respecting the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
This was stated by the Head of State during his visit to Kharkiv province, commenting on Hungary ' s issuance of its passports to Zakarpatya.
In defending Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” Poroshenko stressed.
According to Poroshenko, as President, he will protect Ukrainian citizens, wherever they may be, in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the passport scandal with Hungary, which is the intention to expel the Consul of that country from Beregovo.
“I fully share every letter that the MFA says,” noted the President.
According to FACTS, on 19 September a video appeared on the network showing the moment Ukrainian citizens were issued Hungarian passports at the Hungarian Consulate in Bergovo.
In doing so, they swore their allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, pointed out that the Hungarian Consul, who appeared on video of the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself or be expelled by Kiev.
It was also reported that the Prosecutor ' s Office of the Zakarpatsk Region had initiated criminal proceedings for the issuance of Hungarian passports.
The incident is classified under “State treason”.
Putin flew into Siberia in secret.
It is known that Vladimir Putin has spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he participated in the work of the CIS Council of States, and has also held a number of bilateral meetings with the Presidents of neighbouring countries.
The flight data of Russian “No. 1” on Flightradar indicate that around 6 p.m. in Tajik time on 28 September, Il-96-300 left Dushanbe airport and took a course north-east.

According to Baikal24, the president in Abakakan met Victor Zimin, the region's chief of staff, on the night of 29 September.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but the website's sources believe that the real reason is "the problem of the second round".
Next Sunday, the second round of elections for the head of the region is to be held in Hakasia.
Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and Victor Zimin, the current head of the Republic, were released.
However, on 21 September, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
Andrei Filyagin (Just Russia) is to take part in the upcoming tour with Konovalov.
The Hakasian media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Hakasia and appoint a new Vrio head of the republic, as well as decide on the fate of Zimin.
Putin already visited Hakasia in January this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the President's favorite vacation places.
More than 10 million Syrians have been refugees since the outbreak of the armed conflict in Syria for seven years.
Some five million people fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Damascus believes that the hostilities are now nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
The Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Al-Muallem, stated this when he addressed the United Nations: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions had been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they had been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which had made life difficult for people and deprived them of their means of livelihood.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate and provide funds for the return of refugees.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, arguing that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
Volkswagen fully pleaded guilty to "dieselgate" in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the company's American division, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The loss of the company is estimated at least €25 billion.

Volkswagen is trying to make up for the loss and restore the trust of its customers.
Recently, for example, the management of the concern has changed again, and a major restructuring and policy changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy out even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: this right was granted to the authorities in February this year.

Mitropolis Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the OPC with the actions of the fascists.
The head of the Synodial Department of External Ecclesiastical Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Mitropolit Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
“It's like wearing a yellow sharp-pointed star on a Jew in Nazi Germany, marking the Church as an enemy organization, and that's what this bill was created for,” stated the Metropolitan on Russian 24 (quoted by Interfax).
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the OPC and “to outlaw it”, according to the clergyman.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
It has previously been reported that members of the Supreme Council are working on the implementation of draft laws Nos. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the renaming of the OLC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The vice-president of Pochaevskaya lavi called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian holy sites
The vice-president of the Pochaev Mytropolit Vladimir called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian holy sites.
The text of his address to believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) was published on Saturday on the homepage.
At various times in history, our predecessors and Christian relatives had to profess their faith and protect their holy places.
Given the current situation, and according to the information available to us and the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we will also have to deal with something”, the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
He also stressed that it might be "your physical presence" that would be required.
The minister added: “Lenin's grandkids, by spirit, are threatening to kill, and therefore we will defend our holy place.”
To those who care about the fate of Pochaevskaya laura, an Orthodox Ukrainian and universal shrine, it is stated in the address.
The Mitropolis urged that those who mislead believers should avoid doing so.
The OPC has canonical status as defined by Tomos on 29 October 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make him dependent on the news patriarch and a friend of the Catholic Pope of Bartholomew.
The new style and its consequences are unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we're happy with the status our church has,' noted the viceroy of honor.
He recalled that the HCC had been canonically independent and fully autonomous in its administration since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?" noted Pochaevsky Vladimir, who urged believers and all citizens to ask whether the other Tomos denominations had any independence from the Vatican?
Some of the believers have made some sense and decided which temple they should go to.
However, some people want to sow animosity and strife again.
Some are jealous that the domes are shining on temples they want to destroy.”
Pochaevskaya lair is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
It is located on the top of Pochaevsky Mountain, 70 km from Ternopolis.
Its first history dates back to the early 13th century.

My life is still teaching me... and when I start to understand people, Boozova wrote.
Many fans reacted negatively to such a post and noted that the singer had actually “not seen a real life”.
"You haven't suffered yet.
Stick to every word, live in a normal, ordinary family," wrote @nataliaama37.
There were others who advised Buzova to go to psychologists or at least read books on the subject.
"Why don't you read the psychology literature?
What do you have to do to avoid being the victim?" wrote @liashukgalina.
However, there were some who supported the singer.
"Ola, you don't have to be upset.
Your man won't talk loud across the country and then just don't do it," supported @arina_prostyle.
"You're a queen and you need a king, and whoever traded you for paper just doesn't deserve you.
Up your nose and move on," wrote @kreszentia_f.
Nazarov had previously explained his decision to take 2 million rubles and abandon Buzova because the singer had no sympathy for him.
He decided to spend all his money on charity.
If we continue to play the right way, the victories will come.

"The good game was interesting, though it was going to the goal," says Sparrow's official website, "Attomobilist."
"We've been trying to play a very simple game.
I really liked the first phase.
Didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, our opponent got a little ahead of us, and we survived.
But we've been fed a little bit.
The guys were playing great, doing the coaching.
I think if we keep playing the right game, the victories will come.
They didn't score, they don't win the game with zero goals, but the content of the game was right.
Luck will come if we keep playing in that direction."
"In your opinion, did the Motorist add more than the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
"Then there was no foreign link.
At the pre-season, the teams did other tasks, played many young people.
I think there was a completely different game, a different hockey game.
The motorist is a good team.
From the tournament table, it's clear the team is playing the right game.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
We can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalie.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
They knew the team was going without fail, they wanted to break it, but it didn't work."

That treaty must resolve a long-standing dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, like TASS.

The United States is experiencing an increase in the production of opiates in Afghanistan
The dramatic deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September was much discussed in Tehran.
Multilateral consultations were held with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council.
Indeed, in Afghan territory, the militants launched a real terrorist war against the State authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year is the highest number of bloody attacks that have claimed the lives of thousands of ordinary Afghans,” noted Patrushev.
Afghanistan's troubles didn't start yesterday.
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist group Al-Qaida (prohibited in the Russian Federation) in Afghanistan was declared the main enemy of the United States.
Not a month later, America and NATO allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom there.
It's been 17 years.
The thousands of American troops are now on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more spectre than it was then.
American troops are trapped behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they pay off the fighters for money, just as long as they don't get touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country, 40 per cent, according to Patrushev.
50% Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% are for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they grow up there fast.
The aim is to create a barbaric pseudo-phalyphate in Central Asia, exactly what they did not have in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be okay with that.
It is also good that in 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs ( opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times.
The vast increase in the area sown with opium poppy and multi-billion-dollar profits.
The Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia, looking in that name at the attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, a political scientist, said, "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is entitled to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will assert the right to its past.
There's no such thing as perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy.”
The renaming of the country is supported by the ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Conservative opposition and President George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is clear that there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Faye Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole.”
