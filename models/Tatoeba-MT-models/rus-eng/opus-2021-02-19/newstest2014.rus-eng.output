In Kineshma and the district, two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the hangers had attempted suicide.
On 30 October, around 100, in Lugovoje village, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
He was known to have attempted suicide before.
What prompted a man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, 11-50, a 41-year-old man, resident of Kineshma, committed suicide in his home.
No signs of violent death have been found, reports the Ministry of Internal Affairs press service Kineshemsky.
Is there a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair a collapsing highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box carefully built on your car's dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile a motorist passes and convey this information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt to modernize America’s outdated highway financing system by Washington and state planners.
Usually, the boring highway planning arena has suddenly generated intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government's right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you drive, and possibly even where you drive them, and then use that information in tax accounts.
The tea party movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
Although Congress is not yet in a position to agree whether to proceed or not, several states are not going to wait.
They wonder how, over the next decade, we can move to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of road they pass.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“This is not a matter for us to choose,” said Hasan Ihrata, Executive Director of the Southern California Government Association, who is preparing plans to start tracking the miles that each Californian motorist passes by 2025.
There's gonna be a change in how we pay these taxes.
There's already technology for that.
This need is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Road Foundation, which is financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as they used to.
Cars travel more than miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been raised in 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise the tax by even a cent at high gas prices.
“The tax on petrol simply cannot be saved,” said Lee Mannich, an expert on transport policy at Minnesota University.
In his staff, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on vehicles to test the mileage system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
The nerds call it a plentiful user fee.
Not surprisingly, this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are looking at this system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the state’s ambitious anti-global warming laws.
However, House Member Bill Schuester (Republican, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Chamber's Transport Committee, said that he also saw the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-marketers at the Reason Foundation are also thrilled to make drivers pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that goes into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President for Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement has also been supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards a peace payment.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project involving about 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal for fear of village legislators representing voters, who often had to travel many miles to work or to the city in daily life.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is found in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the state for miles of mileage instead of a gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It's under review in New York.
Illinois will try it on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 Eastern Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer vehicles were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could track every move.
“The concern about the big brother and things like this is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who is in charge of strategy and performance management in the Nevada Department of Transport.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the trials were well under way, the Nevada branch of the American Civil Liberties Union warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to record the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where there is a difficult search for low-cost technology that would allow the state authorities to keep track of miles driven by a car, but without information about place and time.
If you can do that, Han said, society will feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not assist in collecting state taxes.
It sought to enter the emerging market for motor insurance, in which drivers were paid on the basis of mileage.
But the devices she's testing attract road designers because they don't use GPS and they provide a limited amount of information that's periodically downloaded by modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There were some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with providing drivers with different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state pass.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of a cautious public, forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a taxation device that will also accept parking counters, provide “pays as you drive” insurance and collect a real-time speed pool from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.
“The motorists will be drawn to the benefits that will be offered to them,” says the urban design document.
Some transport system designers are, however, wondering whether all the talk of a quarter is simply a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Gulf City Transport Commission, officials say that Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the trust fund for highway construction by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
The EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in the event of Russian economic pressure
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as an agreement with IMF on emergency credit if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association treaty between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
A stand-by loan is being negotiated with IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal is to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the EU itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing differences on financing terms.
Nor does the international rating agency S&P, which lowers Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step on Friday, down to B-B.
However, the EU representatives said that IMF could be flexible in lending terms, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a back-up option to provide Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which now comes from Russia.
Maybe it'll be gas from the Northern Flux or reverses from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia “insulates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this mode of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and is likely to reduce supplies to other regions.
“Consultations are under way between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources rather than from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes”, added the source Reuters.
Russia Without Car Pollution
Attempts to address the transport problems of large cities have been seen in most of the world's mega-cities since the second half of the twentieth century.
These were usually either the upgrading and extension of the highways or attempts to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of vehicles and the time of their use.
The case of Singapore is well known, where strict quotas have been introduced for the growth of private cars and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
Its price may be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced fees for entry into the city centre.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, allowing only cars with a certain eco-class, which also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a “five-year clean air plan” for a total cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to the Director of Transport Pollution Control of Beijing ' s Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, Lee Kunscheng, the main goal of the five-year-old is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (now 5.2 million) and to increase fuel use by no more than 5 per cent per vehicle.
According to the agency, vehicles in Beijing now account for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme are the restriction of the use of road transport and the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, urban measures of the “green five” include the accelerated transition to Euro fuel standards compared with the rest of the country, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and car and fuel labelling, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the prohibition of the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition to the introduction of incentive financial programmes for the replacement of old vehicles with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service transport), and the development of public transport (including high-speed transport).
The automobile innovations in Beijing also include the ban on all private cars to travel within the fifth transport ring (six in total in the capital PRC) one day a week (relevant information is contained in the vehicle licence plate) and the issue of lottery-based car registration plates (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only one third of the year 2010).
According to the current State programme “Environmental Protection 2012-2020”, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 it was 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011 “mobile sources” accounted for 41 per cent of all emissions of pollutants to the urban atmosphere.
In Moscow, for example, car emissions are ten times higher than industrial emissions and in St. Petersburg nine times higher.
The Russian Federation is just beginning to think about the possibilities of restricting the regulation of automobiles on the streets of cities.
The Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the HSE, Mikhail Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at curbing the demand for road travel are notoriously unpopular and can only be adopted by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its vehicle fleet, where there are two clusters of less sensitive to any regulatory impact - service and personal cars, as well as cars of “privileged” users with a total of at least 200,000 (about 5 per cent of Moscow's total fleet).
The other day, urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study analysing the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers are that the city centre is provided with roads that are half the required, and that most of the motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them in parking or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parking spaces, but to build car depots, but rather to reduce the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly to pedestrians) and to limit the use and location of private transport within the security area of the historic centre (a total area of about 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will increase by a factor.
According to city authorities, an increase in fines would help to clean up Vologda and free the streets of wild tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they sell often do not pass appropriate sanitary controls.
Which means that the health of the Vogogens is being compromised.
Thus, since November, the lower limit of fines for unauthorized trade for citizens will increase sixfold, from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles, as reported by the Vologda Administration Press Service.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to Russia’s main driver of fragile economic growth – consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment on unfunded consumer credit and a massive reduction of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of that growth.
In recent times, it has been entirely driven by consumption, which has barely slowed down,” said the chief economist, Goldman Sachs, for Russia, Clemens Grafe, presenting yesterday’s quarterly report on the Russian economy.
Now Russia's nominal wage rise is about 10%.
With an inflation rate of 6%, he will be able to meet future consumer demand at about current levels, expected in Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is declining, so they are likely to optimise staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages increase by 10 per cent, GDP by only 2 per cent, Mr. Grafe explained.
Companies have experienced a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow, it could lead to dismissals and increased unemployment.
Russia’s business cannot raise wages, and Barclays Capital’s chief economist for Russia and the CIS, Vladimir Pantushin, comments.
Unemployment near historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise salaries to lure employees away or retain current employees.
Russia’s demand for support is also growing very rapidly.
According to Mr. Grafe, this type of lending has no multiplier effect on the country ' s economy because of the extremely high rates of consumer borrowing.
“The benefits to the economy of growing demand for credit have not been seen, money is not divided into economies, but goes back to the same banks in the form of interest payments,” the economist said.
But the problem is that Goldman Sachs is expecting an increase in the default on unfunded loans.
They are mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide for them.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are often not returned.” Mr. Grafe noted.
Therefore, the second threat to growth in Russia is a possible non-payment crisis on unfunded loans.
Vasily Solodkov, the director of the BSE Banking Institute, is already seeing signs of an emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to cheap resources available to public banks, were forced to raise funds at high interest rates.
In response, the government banks embarked on a war path and began to lower credit rates, as the economist continued.
Small lending organizations cannot lend at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the government banks do not give up dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, Vasily Sodkov believes.
The withdrawal of licences from a number of banks in recent weeks has been seen by the economist as a precursor to a massive collapse.
“The banks themselves will not be able to deal with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis”, the head of the institute warns.
But consumption growth will slow down, and without a crisis of non-payment, they're believed in the investment bank, because of the non-indexation of civil servants' and military salaries that is embedded in the current version of the draft budget.
The impact on consumption will be partially mitigated by the freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and consequently by the reduction of inflation).
But only partially: if the investment does not grow (and the preconditions are not yet there - see the certificate), consumption growth will slow down anyway, we're sure about Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen the prerequisites for implementing pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a fall in the price of oil," he says.
He estimated that the Russian economy would begin to decline at a cost of less than $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CD is not yet in a position to lower interest rates in the economy.
The paradoxical picture is that inflation has declined and banks have begun to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CD that announced the transition to inflation targeting,” Clemence Grafe said.
The Central Bank ' s interest rate policy does not affect market rates, only affects interbank lending rates.
"For the CB, it's the collapse of all hope," Cléments Counte appreciated.
Banks don't use money from the CD auctions to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
Once the rate is down, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to venture against the ruble.
“At some point, the CB will realize that this strategy is not working”, said Mr. Grafe, and recalled that the state plans to put the ruble in “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But we're either going to have to do it sooner, or we're going to have to raise the key bet of the CD (5.5%), he thinks.
According to his assessment, the ruble is now artificially overestimated by 10%.
Rublu's only one way to weaken, the expert concludes.
But if the CB puts any doubt in the financiers that the elimination of the foreign exchange corridor is not part of a policy to weaken the ruble, it could bring down the ruble much more.
The Second Congress of the Peoples of South Ural was held in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum is on the occasion of the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The convention was attended by delegations from all cities and regions of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies, totalling some 350 persons.
The purpose of the forum is to strengthen inter-ethnic harmony.
We can set an example here not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
We have no differences or disagreements.
We live in full harmony, says Theophan, the Mitropolis of Chelyabinsky and Zlatoustskiy.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the education of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
At the end of the convention, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued at the opera and ballet theatre.
An exhibition of the national cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on US intelligence.
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence whistleblower, stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
The German deputy Hans-Christian Streubele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, who the deputy presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he said: “While the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my Government continues to view dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political speech with criminal charges that offer no protection.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. Government to drop criminal charges against him.
Charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Minister of the Interior, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense following allegations that the NSA had tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads a parliamentary group in charge of intelligence, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, “without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States completely”, it should be used.
Mr. Streubele, MP for the Green Germany Party, published his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Streubele said that, according to the lawyer of a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would have needed assurances that he would be “safe” there, said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had encountered a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the world's response to “his political rhetoric”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high - ranking officials — including in the United States — found the disclosure of an uncontrollable system of pervasive surveillance to be beneficial to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand baggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers could keep the whole can.
The new hand baggage fee applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said she'd charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travellers paid only when they were at the landing gate.
Agent Frontier Kate O'Malley said that a $100 fee should make the passengers take care of the payment in advance.
“We do not want to charge for this,” she said.
The airlines began to charge for the first and second bags of luggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges fill as much as they can into the hand baggage placed in the upper baggage compartments, which often means that there is a lack of space in these compartments.
Tolls are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection wasn't really about making money.
The thing is, Frontier's most loyal clients are saying it's getting harder to find a place in the upper luggage compartments.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the Frontier flight can be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing procedures on the website and at the Frontier registration desks is meant to ensure that passengers will know about the assembly before they land.
The new Frontier fee for hand baggage will not start until summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that baggage handling costs money, and the passengers who need it have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of loss.
However, most of them did not relate to the hand baggage charge.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first fee for hand baggage three years ago, and another Allegian Air discounter later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the extra charges.
According to his December 2011 report, the hand baggage charge brings in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former senior manager of Midwest Airlines, was on a Spirit flight recently, and he wondered what he would find at the landing gate when passengers faced an unusual Spirit collection for hand baggage.
“The landing process was the smoothest thing I've seen in my career in airlines,” he said.
I was expecting to see the teeth grinding and a fight at the landing gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing was fast."
Frontier also follows Spirit for $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who received soda or juice could keep the entire can and that coffee would be provided free of charge.
She'll still be distributing water free of charge.
US Airways tried to charge for drinks for a short time in 2008, but refused seven months after the passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's initiative to charge for hand baggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its last move to attract customers to its website.
The airlines pay online ticket vendors like Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to contact an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone far beyond all in this area.
In September, she started to give twice as many bonus miles to frequent flyers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the bonus number of miles to 25 percent of the miles.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would have made it 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance only if they buy tickets directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming a loss.
Revenue declined by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results released on Wednesday by the parent company Public Airways Holdings Inc.
Public is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
NSA blames "internal error," not hackers for shutting down the site.
The undercover National Security Agency announced on Friday night that the shutdown of their site for a few hours had caused a technical breakdown, not hackers, as alleged online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the planned update,” the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the interruption was caused by a distributed “service denial” [DDoS] attack are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA site had not been operational for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Previously, the NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal secret network “unless” was hacked.
No classified information was in danger, the representative informed.
At least one online group of activists claimed that it was responsible for disableing the NSA website through the DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to capture the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the super-secret NSA, once called “No such Agency”, has been the focus of public attention and fierce criticism in recent months, following a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and within the country — all a reaction to NSA secret files stolen from the agency and published by a disappointed former NSA employee, Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has led to the suggestion that today's incident was the result of targeted hacking.
Bombardier's profits are declining with lower deliveries and fewer aircraft orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday, owing to the reduced number of aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contractual problems in its railway unit.
The Montreal-based Bombardier company also did not publish any data on the flight tests of its newest CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial use by the next September would be implemented.
After the first flight of a pilot aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three times, raising questions as to whether the test stage was on schedule.
The results did not meet the expectations and resulted in a fall of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his rating on Thursday from “over-average market” to “medium market” because of the belief that stock growth was limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the performance of the transport division,” Doerksen said in the stock market review.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the family of CSeries will allow it to gain a place in the lower price segment of the market, now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot aircraft was presented in March and flew for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, there are still not too many hard orders for CSeries, 177, as potential buyers await the results of the flight tests to verify the company's claims of fuel efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
There are currently 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boduan was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 hard orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
On Thursday, leaders also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward as planned.
“The actual aircraft model did not remain on the ground longer than expected,” Boduan said during a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software upgrades were planned during the plane's crash.
All manufacturers plan tests in different ways.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break from the renovation, and that's what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks, and all the others will soon follow, as the company reported.
Still, analysts are sceptical of the claim that the first client will be able to operate the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it estimated the commissioning date and would provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow flight test pace, although apparently consistent with Bombardier’s internal schedule, reinforces our view that the launch will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doherksen said.
In the third quarter, ending September 30, Bombardier's net income declined to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted return on the share remained the same, at 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, down from 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders dropped from 83 to 26.
The order portfolio of the Air Space Department was $32.9 billion as at 30 September, with no change since 31 December.
“In the aerospace field, the results were consistent with our objectives, but the low number of orders received and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor,” Boduan said.
Gross income from the aerospace route fell by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train producer, reported that gross revenue in this sector increased by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit was $32.6 billion as at 30 September, a slight increase from 31 December.
The revenue of the transport unit has been adversely affected by problems in the execution of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced that Google's CEO, Patrick Pichett, would be on the board, fell by 8.5 per cent, to C$4.83 in mid-Thursday bidding.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony's counting on a lower annual return.
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, after completing the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast of profit for the current fiscal year.
Sony’s results between July and September 2013 were more depressing than expected, owing to the fall in demand for television, video cameras, and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company the first operating surplus of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in operating losses during the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through a difficult time, especially because of the reduced demand for television.
And while competitors seek a solution to a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: sales are growing rapidly, especially through automobile systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to earn 179 billion yen in operating surplus against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
According to Thomson Reuters, however, analysts estimated that the figure would be significantly higher at 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony expands the food line.
In the middle of this month, the sales of smart clocks were announced from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashionable functions that would make it possible to get rid of the need to pull out of the smartphone pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered the annual profit and profit forecast, the company lost more than 11% of its stock at the Tokyo Torog opening in the morning, falling to 1,668 yen per share.
The speech gene turned out to be a synapse booster.
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered proteins that make Foxp2's "gen of speech" function by stimulating new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science and can be read on the magazine’s website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 with the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes even did not understand each other themselves.
Scientists found that family members had been disrupted by the Foxp2 gene, but the way in which it performed its function remained unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of Foxp2's function is to stimulate the formation of new synapses in the speech-forming area of the brain.
He's doing it through another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered by a search for factors that stimulate synapse formation.
SRPX2 turned out to be one of the 10 genes found by the authors, but only on its activity is Foxp2.
What SRPX2 does affect vocalization, scientists confirmed in a mouse experiment.
When the gene activity in animals was artificially reduced, they screamed less when they were separated from their mother.
If the gene activity has been restored, the frequency of the sound produced has also been restored.
Previously, mice also showed a connection to the vocalization of Foxp2.
Animals who were injected with a human copy of the gene were fed more actively and at a lower frequency than regular mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2's work, and consequently its SRPX2, is related to purely “mechanical” sound formation or more subtle processes.
The cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the gang leader of a police investigation is in prison.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta passed information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be solved.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Queen ' s Court of Liverpool.
A pretentious lawyer who told a drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid to expose his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
Forty-two-year-old Basharat Ditta passed secret information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough on the investigation of his drug trafficking activities after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, who received the nickname Bash and who was called a “cool lawyer” among the criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011, following a police surveillance operation on Scarborough, which he had previously represented at a drug trial.
Officers observed 32-year-old Scarborough leaving three bags of cocaine at his lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire County, while he was at a dinner party with a bar association with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta was “regularly using” a Class A drug after the tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two persons on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at that time as part of a major investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Mercyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
42-year-old Ditta passed information on to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be solved.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditt, which works for the Forbes Solicitors, in Blackburn, he was disgraced after having been found guilty in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer was exposed after the police investigating Scarborough found out that he had been on a regular phone with Ditta since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and discovered how he approached Ditt's house in Blackburn and placed 60 percent pure drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer's trash box.
Shortly after the broadcast, Scarborough called repeatedly from Ditta, who was at the Ewood Park football stadium of Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court learned that Ditta “used cocaine regularly” after the tests found traces of a Class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client and insisted that their communication was a “lawyer secret”.
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove some credit cards, but all of them were confiscated and a hair sample was taken from him.
During a police interview, he said that, along with his workplace, he had a home office and clients came to his house on legal matters.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he called the largest drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell them that they were known to the detectives.
In the indictment, Anne White said, “If anyone knows that they should not violate the law, it is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has had too close relations with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, it's a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
This, however, has largely exceeded the usual legal and client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but shamed her.
He became too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed him to doubt his lack of interest.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done so immediately”.
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police Force stated: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal lawyer as soon as he started buying drugs from organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main members of criminal gangs who have entrusted him with the task of obtaining valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and instil trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
The investigation of Mr. Ditt was conducted by the Lancashire Specially Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which has already sentenced him to three cases of cocaine possession and now to obstruct justice, demonstrating our desire to obtain fair punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this act serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was convicted for 14 years after confessing guilt in conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
An additional 35 persons who had been involved in the fraud had been sentenced to 153 years for drug-related offences.
On his website, Ditta arranged a question-and-answer session in which he said that his dream work was a lawyer representing American death row clients, his perfect dinner companion was Mohammed Ali, and job motivation was inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavla is not ready to receive 22,000 viewers, but was noted by the police officers who were present today at the KDC meeting of the Russian Federation.
The flight programme was, in their view, roughly doubled.
During the 1/16 final match of the Russian Cup with Spartacus, only a thousand stewards were involved, with a regular norm of 9,000.
Spartakov fans were entitled to 2,200 seats, or 10 per cent of the stadium’s capacity, but agreed with the Moscow club to sell 5,000 tickets.
This data was released to KDC head Arthur Grigoriantz.
Americans eavesdropped on Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, a United States intelligence official who chose not to reveal his name stated that the States had been listening to telephone calls from high-ranking Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that there are several listening points in the rising sun.
He noted, however, that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not engage in intelligence activities against each other.
This, he said, was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, despite its alliance with the Americans in the post-war period, is the target of intelligence activities, reported NHK.
No official comment has yet been made on this information by either party.
Let's remind you, news of U.S. Secret Service surveillance of the German chancellor showed up last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to tap Merkel's phone for the past 10 years.
The Chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her wiretaps very painfully.
She stated that the allies she believed had been the German and U.S. allies for decades, such supervision of the head of government was unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden stated that he was prepared to share details of Angela Merkel's wiretapping with German prosecutors.
The German came to Moscow on purpose to meet with a former CIA employee.
Bashkiria can put grain on the market not before early 2014
Bashkriya may not put grain on the market during public procurement interventions until early 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic, Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the market price is higher, there's demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be traded after New Year's Day," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that during the current year, 3.1 million hectares of crops had been planted for the 2013 harvest, including 1.7 million hectares of cereals, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
A total of 550,000 hectares were planted in 2014 (an increase of 105,000 hectares over 2012).
The area under winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and the faces have remained at the same level.
There's no Bratsky Circle in the I.A.'s base that Lepps was assigned to in the U.S.
The databases of Russian silos of the Bratsky Circle, to which Washington named singer Grigory Leps, are not listed.
According to Interfax of the Russian Federation's law enforcement agencies, all databases were checked after the media reported that the U.S. Department of the Treasury had placed Gregory Leps on control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate “Brother Circle”, but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which allegedly operates abroad, is regarded by the security forces.
"Even in the name 'Brother Circle', there's some element of mystery, there's a hint of a secret bed.
"It's very much like a PR campaign," said the agency's interviewee.
On October 31, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that Arthur Badalian, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalski and Igor Szykov were listed on their watch lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate “Brother Circle”.
The individuals on the list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafour Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the United States sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "is the courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
Grigory Leps's production center refused to comment on the U.S. accusations against the singer, calling them "breach."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama identified the Brother Circle Syndicate as one of the “significant transnational organized crime groups” and instructed the Minfine to “prevent and prohibit their global criminal operations”.
Placing a person on the blacklist of a U.S. Ministry of Finance has resulted in the freezing of his assets in the U.S. and a ban on business with him by people living in the United States.
Scandal video got to the police.
Toronto's head, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and blatantly reckless acts, was caught smoking crack.
The Canadian police stated that they had the relevant video and were ready to open an investigation against the city chief.
He stated that he would not leave his post, reporting to CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's drug use appears on the Toronto PD website.
Bill Blair, head of local law enforcement, held a press conference on the subject.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share these skills with the public, but he was charged with their existence.
According to Blair, Rob Ford's compromising video was discovered during an anti-drug raid carried out by guards in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the Canadian press had written about the existence of the video, but until recently there had been no evidence.
The mayor himself does not comment on this.
He's just saying he's innocent and he's not going to resign.
The police video footage is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend of Ford Alexander Lisi, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal profits and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Foxy was the driver of Rob Ford.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He had repeatedly fought journalists, appeared in public in a drunken manner, and made racist and sexist remarks.
Assmann Beraten + Planen, a German company, was recognized by Rostovaeroinvest as the winner of the tender chosen by the object's engineer.
The amount of the contract at Rostoveroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the press service of the OAO, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition and, under the terms of the tender, the draft is to be prepared and sent to a State expert in the spring of 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and airport facility improvements.
In the first phase of construction, the terminal will have an internal area of 50,000 square metres, which may be increased in the future.
According to Rostoveroinvest, the project documents will take into account the development of the airport complex: by 2025 the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035 it will have 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was concluded, the architectural concept of the Southern Air Station, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects, had been defined.
The main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities in the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience with major projects, and the company designed terminals C and E of the International Airport of Sheremetievo and a new air terminal at Knjevici International Airport in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport complex will be built in the Aksai district of Rostov Oblast and will replace the existing growth of the airport, which will be closed and eventually integrated into urban development.
The construction of the air station is scheduled to begin in 2014 and the installation of all facilities in 2017.
Politician in Turkey went on a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of the separation wall in the area of the town of Nusaibin in south-east Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the PMD pro-Kurd party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish town of Nusaibin Aishé Gekhan, on the border with Syria, went on a hunger strike protesting the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, and reported the news to RIA in the Peace and Democracy Party (PDP) press service on Friday.
The police repeatedly dispersed protest demonstrations.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muammer Güler, first denied the construction, then stated that the wall was being built to secure the borders.
"Mayor Nusaibina Aishé Gekhan, a member of the PMD, went on a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," said the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, and the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhuman situation that the Kurds will never agree with,” quotes Aisha Gekhan of the party.
According to the press service, a meeting against the construction of the separation wall is scheduled to take place in Nusaybin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set the exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the Bolívar currency, against the tourist dollar.
This was reported by Bloomberg on 1 November, with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange sums equivalent to US$ 10,000 in a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the bolivar acquired in the country at the time of departure.
The specific value of the bolívar against the dollar will be established at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolívares per dollar.
On the black market, however, the dollar is estimated at 57 bolívares.
Since the beginning of the year, the Bolivar has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent.
The Minister of Petroleum and Vice-President of Economy, Rafael Ramirez, stated on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the Bolívar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to depreciate the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of containing the prices of products and commodities of high consumption, as well as the high degree of overregulation of the Venezuelan economy, have led to a shortage of a number of products and the functioning of the black exchange market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Andrei Belmach, director of Southra, noted that it was difficult to tell how long it would take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so I'm not ready to tell you how long it's gonna take to find a new coach. ITAR-TASS quotes Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking into all the possibilities.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't want to just find some coach, but someone who's gonna work at our club for a few years and get some results.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask: What can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of the Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news website.
He said that the new media court “will always be biased, as it is a continuation of the government”, and restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the government to “take over the media with a dead grip,” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have been hit hard,” and criticized the bill as “draconian.”
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping centre.
The Kenyan media provoked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage of troops who were allegedly being sent to the scene of the attack robbing an expensive shopping centre.
The reaction of Chief of Police David Kimayo was to summon two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled following mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishing houses could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, with an additional risk of being “delisted”, i.e., denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender ' s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations.”
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “viable blogosphere”.
Politicians realize that by silence the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Nation Mutuma Matthew, characterizing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrence and balance in public life.
“The politicians left to themselves will ruin the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to eliminate the cuts made by the National Wages Commission and to restore their huge salary of approximately 532,000 shillings per month, which is tax-free, one of the highest in the world.
There will be a new line of expenditure in the utility payments of the crows - a contribution for the renovation of the house.
It is estimated that 100 to 400 roubles per month will have to be paid in addition for a standard two-room apartment from the new year.
The precise standard will be determined by the Government of the region.
But when you paint the entrance, put the stairwells in order, or even replace the elevator, it's up to the tenants to decide.
Such a law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Kvalnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: “In this case too, order must be established - the order of the capital repairs to the houses must be established, the funds must not be accumulated in the management companies - which we often have registered in Moscow or Orenburg or elsewhere - it will be the State's control over the expenditure of the funds that the residents collect for the renovation of the apartment buildings.”
Under the control of the State, there is now a share of construction.
The law protecting against fraud has been approved in final reading.
The document wasn't born empty.
In our region, 4,500 people have been affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law lays down rights and obligations for all those involved in the equity project.
Vladimir Kvalnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said, "It is no secret that there have also been abuses in this area, due to the fact that in the 98th year the cobblers got the same ones, and in the 2000s the same cobblers."
People started making money to cover the loophole, including passing these two laws.
It has been decided to build a temporary holding centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation under Voronezh.
The regional parliament has passed such a law not only under the pressure of the Federation.
The problem of illegal migrants in the region is even greater.
For example, just over 100,000 foreigners entered the migration register last year.
But only one out of five got a formal work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Kvalnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said, "They have broken the law, but they are not criminals."
There's no trial, and you have to deport them. You have to keep them somewhere.
The Federation decided that such places should be established with regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, this is the Old Olshanka of the Semiluk region.
Well, lastly, the regional parliament gave new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families with five or more children are completely exempt from the transportation tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million, but so do parents with many children.
Secondly, and most importantly, those who adopt three or more babies will receive housing subsidies from the new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
A family of six, for example, is a father, a mother, a natural child and a third adopted child.
For them, according to the regulations, the State buys 108 square metres of housing for 3 million rubles.
For the left bank or the south-west neighbourhood, it is an acceptable option.
Well, at the center, you can buy a whole cottage for that.
Baumgertner nominated for the Uralkaliya Board of Directors
The current board of directors of the U.S.U. Uralkalius has put forward a candidate for the new board of directors of Vladislav Baumgertner, who was arrested in Minsk, and is posted on the Russian company's website.
Bamgertner is on the list of 11 individuals nominated to the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, at which a new board of directors will be established by vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
At the time of his arrest in August this year, he was charged with abuse of authority.
Later, however, President Alexandre Lukashenko of Belarus stated at a press conference that Baumgertner's charges had been reclassified as “theft”.
The gatekeeper Matt Dalton refused to comment on Vladimir Krikunov's departure from his position as lower-chamber mentor.
Golquiper believes that Acting Chief Coach Dmitri Balmin has great authority in the players and will do his job.
Let's remind you, today, the Oil Chemist has retired the Crickuns.
To be honest, I don't want to comment on Vladimir Krikunov's dismissal, quotes Dalton RIA "News."
All I can say is that Dmitri Balmin will live up to his obligations - I have no doubt about that.
He's got a lot of authority on the team, and this young specialist is definitely looking forward to a big future.
The Yuventusa Protector, Leonardo Bonucci, will not help the team in the next Italian match with Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coach headquarters decided not to include him in the game's bid to save him for the 4th round of the League's Real Championships.
Nor will they compete with Parma Lichtsteiner, Vucinich and Pepe.
And foreward Fabio Quallarella recovered from the trauma and is ready to play.
Fuel prices will be increased through tax manoeuvres, which include an increase in the mineral tax (NMDI) on oil while reducing export duties and increasing excise.
In the view of the experts, these measures could add 619.3 billion roubles to the budget.
The president of the Krasnoyarsk court had his ID stolen, hitting him on the head.
The unknown attacked the President of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court, Vladimir Dwakonko, by stealing his identity card.
According to Interfax, late Wednesday evening, the intruders hit the judge in the head, causing him to faint.
When the 63-year-old court president came to his senses, he discovered that he had been pulled out of his ID.
Money and other valuables the criminals didn't take.
He made his way home on his own, and the police only reached out the next day.
A crime investigation and a search for criminals are under way.

The VII Interregional Exhibition "Medicin and Health" opened in Ivanova.
The interregional exhibition "Medicina and Health 2013" opened at the Olympia sports and entertainment complex.
The first Vice-President of the Government of Ivanov province, Olga Hasbulatova, took part in the inauguration of the event.
The exhibition presents the work of the regional health-care budget institutions in the Ivanov province and also commercial health-care institutions in the regions of Central Russia.
Seminars, round tables and presentations will be held as part of the exhibition.
During the exhibition, a mobile complex (full diagnostics), a mobile fluorograph and a blood transfusion station were set up.
All who wish to do so will be provided with free diagnostic procedures, specialist advice, a workshop on physical health education, and a range of services provided at the hospitals in Ivanov province.
In addition, donor's day is held during the exhibition.
The general concept of the exhibition “Medicin and Health 2013” is a preventive approach in medicine and the promotion of healthy lifestyles.
The exhibition presents medical goods and services, equipment, pharmaceuticals and medicines that improve the quality of life.

U.S. Secretary of State: Intelligence agencies have sometimes gone too far in collecting data.
John Kerry, U.S. Secretary of State, admitted that in data collection and wiretapping, American intelligence agencies sometimes went too far, yet the politician noted that the news coverage of 70 million people was incorrect.
I assure you that innocent people have not been harmed in this process, but the attempt to gather information has been.
Yes, in some cases this went too far and was wrong.
I admit that, as the president admits... and we will see to it that it doesn't happen in the future," quotes AFP Secretary of State.
Italian workers with seniority give way to young ones
Italian unemployment beats records.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the population was unemployed.
This has not been so bad since the Second World War.
Among the young, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, early retirement of older workers is one of the solutions to this problem.
This experiment is already being carried out by the largest energy company in the country, and legislation has enabled the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for long-term workers.
On the other hand, on the other hand, Italy is facing a common problem for Europe of an ageing population.
And economists are not sure that the premature rotation of staff will justify itself.
What will be the outcome of the construction of the TPU in Moscow
With each year, the capital authorities promise to establish more transport and trans-shipment hubs (TPIs).
255 TSPs are planned to be put into operation by 2020.
What the project actually turns out to be, our correspondent did.
A couple of months ago, the Smolenskaya subway of the Arbat-Posre Line had a construction fence.
The inscription stated that the transport and trans-shipment node was being built.
This was all very strange, because there is no ground transport that stops near Smolenska, and therefore no land transport can be moved to it.
In order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, it is necessary to cross some 130 metres, including a ground crossing through the Pocket alley.
Smolinski's almost done now.
A flower stand has disappeared, a newspaper stand has been dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance has been replaced by a bar.
That's the whole transport node.
Transport and trans-shipment hubs are flat and capital, as explained by the press service of the Metropolitan Department of Transport.
There are no capital TSPs yet.
And flats involve parking, the removal of commercial facilities that prevent passenger movements, the creation of small architectural forms and improvements.
In fact, it is not even the transporters who carry out the platinum TSPs, but rather the professional promoters of the Moscow City Department of Major Repairs.
The transport node, which is not necessarily complex, explains the director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes there is enough roof over your head and a sign indicating the time of arrival of the transport.
For example, the Yasenevo subway recently opened a fully fledged flat node.
No curtains, but with the intercepting parking spaces and the sign indicating when the bus arrives.
But in the pursuit of numbers, officials record everything they get into the TSP.
As early as 2011, the mayor's office planned to build all 151 knots, 59 of them with capital construction.
The plan now includes 255 TSPs until 2020.
One and a half of them are promised to give up this year.
Although the city has a programme for the development of TSPs, there are no qualitative criteria, as noted by Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization City and Transport.
Counts by number of objects, but the quality of transplants on each one often deteriorates.
The criterion, in the expert ' s view, should be two: first, reduction of the transfer time, and second, convenience.
First of all, the possibility of changing the mode of transport without going into the rain.
In Moscow, however, the construction of the TSPs sometimes goes exactly the opposite way.
It's a vivid example of the "BLEEP" metro.
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslav highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the OCE.
Now, their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka to the street of Cosmonauts.
Far from the subway, far from the monorail, but closer to the apartments.
It's a gift that the residents absolutely didn't want a bus station under the windows and complained to every possible authority.
The capital TSPs in Moscow didn't come at all.
The first one started building five years ago at the Planerella subway.
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And there's really a sample of how an investor's graft is turning into a common mall.
No, there's bus farons, there's a canopy to stay out of the subway in the rain, and there's three floors of parking.
However, the Chemkin trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow's TSP were not given a place in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway like strangers.
But there's still more places to trade.
It's 32 stores alone, and there's almost everything, from zoos to the auto shop.
Well, actually, what if one of the bus passengers needs to buy a new car on the way?
When we build a capital TSP, for some reason, we always have a mall.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion, when part of the parking lot decided to be put on the market.
Now, on the third floor of the Planer's TSP, there's a barbarian trade among the parking spaces marked on the floor.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech, and guards looking evil at our photographer.
The transplant node has finally turned into a bazaar.
The thing is, the Planer's used to have a market, but it's been demolished.
And in the Prefecture, merchants were spared and allowed to intercept the parking lot of the transplant site.
Still, because of high prices, it's always empty.
The funniest thing is that the market has been demolished to build a new flat TSP in its place.
That's the kind of rocking.
The Kaluzhskaya subway had a distance of 50 meters from the subway lobby to the bus, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the mall, allegedly the TPU, the distance increased to 170 metres.
To get on a bus, you have to go through the mall.
After 22 hours, when it's closed, you have to go around it in the open.
However, the designs on Planerna and Kaluzhskaya will soon appear to be flowers.
In mid-September, the City and Land Commission approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TSPs.
Four of them will be 25-story, except for two or three underground longlines.
The main monster will grow up on the Tuscino subway with 418.7 thousand square metres of space.
The RZD railway station authorities responsible for the construction of TSPs by the subway have already told journalists that future multi-storeys will house shops, hotels and apartments.
In doing so, officials argue that multi-tiered parking lots are about a third to a half of the square.
Take "people's" garages as an example.
Let's say the 258-car garage that was recently built on International Street has an area of 8,015 square metres.
So it's going to take about 80,000 squares to park 2,600 cars at Petrovsky-Rasumovsky.
That's less than a third of the machina they're going to build there.
Let's get one or two floors on the bus ramps.
There are at least 150,000 square metres of commercial property left.
And this, for a minute, is almost two GUMAs.
If the main TCUs at the stations and stations are built by rail, the rest of the sites will be developed by subways.
They also promised that there would be many "functional objects", including hotels, offices, and even gymnasiums.
By the way, the Moscow City Property Department recently told journalists that it was drafting a regulation that would allow investors to apply directly to officials for the TSP site.
No contests.
Because, like, transport is a priority for the city.
The perfect TSP is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or the Spadaina station in Toronto, I'm sure Alexander Morozov.
There, trolleybuses and trams go underground to the metro level and the distance from the subway car to the tram is only 50 metres without access to the street.
There's no need to trade around.
But Moscow officials are being pushed to the extreme.
Either we don't build anything, or we're gonna blow 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to equate an insult to patriotism with extremism.
For the legislative protection of the patriotic sentiments of citizens against provocations and insults directed against Russia, Fair Russia proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and punish them for five years.
According to the newspaper Izvetia, such legislative amendments, prepared by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Duma Energy Committee, Oleg Miheev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the Government for their opinion.
By the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to refer to the emotional relationship of a person to a country of which he is a national, characterized by love for that country, responsible treatment of her fate, respect for her history and culture.
According to Miheev, domestic legislation provides sanctions for the abuse of official State authority, the flag and the emblem.
In the view of the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be hurt by the insult of State symbols and other expressions of disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently elaborated in Russian legislation.
By way of example, he cites the annual debate on the eve of Victory Day, where some media personalities have allowed themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the struggle against the fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday, 9 May Victory Day, every year, a real bacchanalia is set in motion.
While exercising in wit and "alternative view" of history, some writers come to the conclusion that it is a pity that cultural Germans have not conquered the wild Soviet Union!
I find this completely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main “spiritual bond” of the nation,” outraged by Oleg Miheev.
Moreover, according to Miheev, there are many more patriotic people in Russia than religious ones, but the law punishes insults to the feelings of believers and insults to patriotic feelings can be almost unpunished.
In the opinion of the popular elected person, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to prescribe appropriate penalties in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for penalties for insulting patriotic feelings, ranging from a fine of 100,000 to 5 years ' imprisonment.
The 6.6 magnitude earthquake occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the town of Coquimbo, in central Chile, and is broadcast by Reuters.
The earthquake was in the ocean 10.7 kilometres deep and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, as explained on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website.
The pens were set at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1, Moscow).
No casualties or damage caused by underground shocks have yet been reported.
Remember, Chile is located in one of the most seismic areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of varying intensity are not uncommon.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake and the resulting tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, it recorded a magnet of 9.5.
More than 5,000 people lost their lives as a result of the disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace will be dealt with fairly
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, announced on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be considered in strict compliance with Russian law.
France can be confident that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
“We can guarantee compliance with the law,” Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with the French Prime Minister, Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizan, like other activists, is charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quotes Mr. Ero's RIA News.
“Our country cannot support activities that could harm the environment, nor can anyone violate the law”, Dmitry Medvedev said.
He said that the activities of any entity that attempted to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy extraction, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were “powder kegs” and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, transmitting the RIA News.
The UN announces new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty throughout the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs that expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro the previous night.
They were included in the final document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit the night before that it was time to “be ahead of national interests.”
“I am pleased that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and control the process of creating the universal sustainable development goals, the SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make every effort to use the authority vested in me by member countries to translate our vision of sustainable development, which is based on the successful achievement of the MDGs.
The security concerns in Mozambique are heightened by the conflict of powerful people
Under the looking down statue of Zamora Machel, the founding President of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to chant peace slogans at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, the executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" on Portuguese, and joined a crowd on Thursday in the Metropolitan Area of Independence.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of clashes between Government forces and Renamo — one of the most violent clashes since the truce was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa of the apartheid era as part of an effort to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the truce of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to fall back into full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for a rapidly growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas shelves and coal deposits in the northwest may attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, a leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party accuse each other of the tensions that have arisen.
Renamo’s party claims that the Government has been behind the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala Province, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels then intensified when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group leader, reported to the Financial Times newspaper Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking the soldiers.
President Armando Gebuza has tried to dispel fears of instability.
Gebusa told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a failure who wanted to use “everything left of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased following reports that Mazanga had declared Renamo's rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he was referring to Frelimo's non-compliance.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential men (Ghebuza and Dhlakama) who have collided with the foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and neither is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo’s party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
Renamo's share of votes has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which was founded by former Renamo members, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was due to resign next year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not clear what the potential of Renamo is, but it has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key highway from north to south.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala Province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beiro, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway lines for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked whether Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo’s party wanted “to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased discontent with the Government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent increases in kidnapping, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the Government and the President, who must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultan, a demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want a return to peace, they want free access to roads,” he said.
A series of Art Mainstream premieres will take place in Moscow.
The "Art Mainstream" series, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will take place at the "Rolan" cinema from 1 to 5 November, reports RIA "News" with reference to the organizers of the project.
It will open the Art Mainstream program by French filmmaker and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at all costs".
This is the story of the Maye model (Sama Kerichi) in the French capital, who is being deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, the audience will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Dook "Mebius", the melodramatic Bayopic by Oliver Hirschbigel "Dian: The Story of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role, and the main film of the Cannes Film Festival "Life Adele" by Abdelatif Keshesha in May.
The only Russian member of Art-Mainstream will be the winner of Alexander Veledinsky's film "Geograph Globe Propyl", based on the same-named novel by Alexey Ivanov.
Konstantin Habensky played the leading role in the film, the charming failure of Victor Slujkin, whose work was also marked by the Kinotaur prize.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models of life”, says the author.
The story of the Torah could show that “brought power cannot defeat subtlety,” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
In saying that many myths will turn out to be “too wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too indecent to teach in schools”, Crossley-Holland advocates “a careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have advocated their introduction into the curriculum for 20 years.
He added that the “excessive moral restraint” of authors and teachers “rejects the interest” of children, while the main ideas are “combating” into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and also wrote the "Norwegian Myth Book" for Penguin and Britanese folk tales, said, "You may have intentions, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps a great difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult writer who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but that there must be an innate understanding of what is good and what is bad.
And it has to be sublimated; it has to be solved through history, not clearly articulated.
The old principle is to show, not tell.
There's a football fan in Voronezh province who broke a window in the waiting area of the station.
At 9 p.m. on 29 October, two football fans, natives of the Moscow region, were removed from the passenger train at the Gräzy-Voronezha station by transport police officers.
On the way to the team's favorite game, the boys had a drunken train wreck.
The young people were taken to the duty station of the line police station at the Gräzy station to draw up a report of an administrative offence.
There, fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police officers filed administrative material against them and released them.
Young people bought tickets to the next train, and at the station station, they waited for him to arrive.
In the middle of the first night, fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly came back and kicked in the front door window of the station waiting room.
A transport police officer and a security guard of the RZD were on the sound of a broken glass.
They were able to apprehend an intruder who had tried to escape the scene.
The staff of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation are conducting an inspection.
The question of the initiation of criminal proceedings is under consideration and was reported by the senior director of information and public relations of the South-East LU of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the transport of Sergei Olkhovik.
Vitaly Mutko: Waters?
I think we're 15 years back.
The Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, gave his opinion on the riots at the podiums during the Russian Cup match "Spartacus".
I support the responsibility of the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we can see that they're in a shaky position.
They're waiting for someone to come and clean up.
That's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
We have to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, not let things run wild.
We've now drafted a special government regulation on the rules of the stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will deal with the problem very closely.
But I'm still going to invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedoun's interview.
The state, like, make the law quick.
It's like the Bavaria fans came to Yaroslavl and all arranged it.
We're outside observers.
In fact, it's terrible to see the stand being watered out of a firewall.
And that's in a country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're back 10 or 15 years ago," Mutko said.
Snowden can be questioned in Russia.
An ex-American intelligence officer, Edward Snowden, is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify on the wiretapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, an American can answer questions from the German Attorney General's Office in writing or in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually ruled out.
“In this case, he would lose refugee status and could be extradited to Washington by countries allied to the United States,” said the agency’s interviewee.
“In principle, however, the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federal Republic of Germany could send representatives to the Russian Federation or hand over written questions to Snowden”, added the source, adding that the issue should be dealt with at the inter-State level.
Formerly, German Bundestag member Hans-Christian Strebele reported that Edward Snowden was willing to testify in a case involving a wiretapping by the United States intelligence services of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is willing to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or on German territory.
An ex-C.I.A. officer has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the US NSA blocking all of his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
To do so, however, all the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined,” Strabel told Euronews.
Snouden's lawyer, Anatoli Kucheren, commenting on the Interfax source's statement, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how would he decide for himself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information on secret U.S. surveillance operations on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the United States authorities, who had charged him in absentia and remained in the transit zone of Sheremechivo airport until early August.
On 1 August, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum on Russian territory for a period of one year and left Sherememievo on the same day.
Yesterday, an American lawyer, Anatoli Kucheren, stated that his client had taken a job with a "large Russian company".
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel last week was reported by German media.
According to journalists, the chancellor’s telephone calls had begun to be tapped by Americans as early as 2002.
The surveillance station was allegedly located at the United States Embassy in Berlin.
Following the publication of this information, the German authorities stated that the surveillance of Merkel violated German laws and sovereignty.
Ponomarev left Fair Russia.
The Member of the State Duma of the Party "Just Russia", a member of its branch in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, submitted an application for withdrawal from a political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he applied to the party ' s New Siberian regional office.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the “justices”.
We're sitting here drinking tea...
"For some reason, many people want to see the painting "Ilia Ponomarev puts a party on the table," but there's nothing so historic about it," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained a good relationship with the regional office of the “Esers”.
However, Ilya Ponomarev, a member of the State Duma, does not intend to give up his mandate.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and was legally unable to leave the party.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the Fair Russia party appeared on 30 October.
Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov were reported to be coming out with him, but the latter soon denied the information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Fumio Kisida, met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“They would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of the political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty”, Kisid said at the meeting.
Japan’s Foreign Minister recalled that since Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between countries have become warmer and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, for his part, noted that the Russian Federation would meet Japan on difficult political issues, writing by RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies the resolution of the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, there are protests in Tokyo today to demand that the land lost after World War II be returned to the country.
The Japanese capital is driven by cars from which the loudspeaker is told, "Return the northern territories!"
The police don't stop the protesters, they don't overdo the noise.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It is safe to say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, entertaining artist Frank Faye, who worked at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Faye's innovation has eventually been picked up by others, most recently the New York comedy festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hersch, founder of the carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and big theatres.
“Most of these headliners started at the Carolines, and then achieved greater success, reaching a level where they were already too famous to be performing at the club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Cathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as "Standap for Heroes", an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have become popular in a non-traditional way, for example, through shows on small television channels like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous for his role in the comedy series on the little-known cable channel (the "FXX F-Licga" on fantasy football), and now runs his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined both Saturday Night live and Parks and Recreation Areas, although she is best known for the series of "Marsell the Shoe in Boots" viral videos.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with a distinctive style (surrealistic, pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a crafty, racially focused Camau Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly the centerpiece of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks down some street between two houses and thinks, "Here's if I don't have any money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistan authorities have started negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of Pakistan in Great Britain, where Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice-Premier Nick Klegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister reported that dialogue with the Taliban had begun, as stated in a statement by the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
He said he hoped and prayed that dialogue would work in accordance with Pakistan's constitution," added diplomats.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the same-named Afghan movement, but operate independently in the north-west of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
Previously, the Islamabad Government had attempted to enter into negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would only negotiate if the authorities took troops stationed in Taliban areas to their permanent locations and released the arrested Islamists from prison.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil's down to $96 a barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about large reserves overshadowed a message that showed that China’s energy-intensive production sector was gaining momentum.
The standard US oil in December's supply was 14 cents lower, and the price was $96.24 per barrel later in the morning of European time in electronic bidding at the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract increased by 39 cents, the sum of which was a 5.8 per cent drop in the October price.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy announced on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels have been replenished.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, based on two reports of Chinese industry showing a surge in its activity.
This suggests that China's recovery may continue to gain momentum after growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after the 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brent's oil, a reference type of international oil also used by United States refineries, has been reduced by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
The chief coach of Colorado, Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release Semen Varlamov's holchiper from the first minute in a Friday match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, conveying from Dallas a co-cor to Natalia Shmelev.
And what do we have to wait for,' said Roua after the morning run of "Lauvin."
Of course, we are all concerned about what happened, but we have confidence in it and feel that it will be good for him to get out on the ice today.
We want him to get out on the ice and show him his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure the situation didn't affect the goalkeeper's condition?
We'll see today.
No doubt our players will support Varley by helping him guard the gates, as was the case in earlier matches of this season.
The point is, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until this situation is resolved by the court.
There's no need to be a vegan in Siberia: a warm tomato doesn't replace soup.
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, was researched by RIA News.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here, they cannot endure the winter without loss of health, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate for them, as seen in the vegan day before New Siberian nutritionists and doctors.
Drinking Litres
Strict vegetarianism becomes a fashionable way of life, not only for meat and fish, but also for milk, honey, and eggs.
However, diet doctors are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, such strict dietary standards are at least not healthy.
The total abandonment of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain indispensable amino acids that are very difficult to compensate for in vegetation.
You have to include milk or eggs in your diet, I'm sure.
She gives an example of a fish that contains the indispensable omega-3 fatty acid.
His richest vegetable oil is linen.
"In order to consume it in the quantities necessary for humans, you need to drink litres!" says a nutritionist.
The medical team believes that the people of Siberia should pay special attention to their diet during the winter.
Vegetarianism is particularly questioned this season.
In our realities, there are high demands on food.
It takes a lot of calories to stay cold.
“If a person limits himself to animal products, therefore, he's missing this calorie,” says the expert.
Olga Posnjak, a diet doctor, agrees.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruit are not an option.
It is better for a person to eat mainly food that is grown in the region or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed to better absorb and digest these products.
And in the winter, people don't want to eat pickles, they want to eat hot soup or something else,” the doctor explains.
According to her, what vegans can eat is really good for various grains, cereals, beans, local vegetables, apples that stay in winter, frozen berries.
But it's certainly not enough to feed enough.
According to a gastroenterologist, Claudia Arifulina, sybrians only had sufficient vitamins in their bodies from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh environmental conditions, when temperatures can change by 30 degrees in a 24-hour period and snow falls in May, is inconvenient.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, above all, fat," says the medic.
Doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnant women also need higher levels of protein, vitamins and micronutrients in the menu.
"Veganks don't get them," I'm sure God will.
Arifulina says that a grown man is free to choose anything to play the toys he wants.
He's got an already formed body, a skeleton, organs.
And yet, children must eat well.
If his parents deprive him of any trace elements or amino acids, choosing what he will eat for him, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of any kind of substance for brain development, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow," she says.
All the medical experts interviewed agree on the low quality of winter-based greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains less of the micronutrients we need than (cultivated) in the open.
"The quality of food is not right," says God.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruit are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the willingness of producers to produce more crops is detrimental to quality.
“Apples do not become brown on a cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and moldy, tomatoes tasteless and non-aromatic,” gives examples of medical practitioners adding that they are most likely filled with excess fertilizer.
And they're not supplying vitamins, they're supplying fibers.
I do not agree with this from the sub-laboratory of the Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology of Agrarian Problems, candidate Vera Petruk.
She said that with the right approach and respect for all standards and requirements in greenhouses, it was possible to grow full-blown vegetables.
If you try to get more of a square metre out, of course, you'll be able to water more and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow rapidly, they are large but watery and unsavory”, she adds, adding that quality is primarily a matter of conscience on the part of the producer.
The Court suspended the execution of the “stop-and-search” decision in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes to the “stop-and-search” program of the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeal stated that the execution of Judge Sheera Scheinlin's decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution in the manner in which it had carried out the street detention and interrogation programme.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and the corrective orders, including an order to appoint a supervisor to help the police force change its practice and training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a hearing by the parties on the motion to stay the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that a judge should be challenged because it violated the U.S. Code of Conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid a display of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to criticisms of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unjustifiably turning to blacks and Hispanics on a “stop-and-search” programme.
It had appointed an external supervisor to oversee major changes that included policy, training and control reforms, and had decided to launch a pilot programme to test video cameras in police stations where most of the arrests took place.
In August, New York decided to discontinue the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases had been closed after police checks.
The hearing on the city ' s appeal is due to take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of “stopping and searching” have been criticized by numerous civil rights lawyers.
Stop-search has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, brought a collective action before the courts.
Supporters of the stop-and-search programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to unfair practices, create a more robust and effective police service and may influence the way other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce the morale of the police rather than the level of crime, lead to unnecessary spending of money, and will not solve the more global problem of difficult police conditions due to a reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she had not stopped the practice of “stop-and-search”, which was in line with the Constitution, but was changing the way the New York Police stopped people.
In the area of the Tretakiv Gallery, the pedestrian area was opened
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretakovsky Gallery and occupies an area two kilometres from the Novokuznetska subway station to the Bolotna Square.
Street Torsers, flowerers, benches, urns and toilets, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been installed throughout.
In addition to the Klimentovsky and Lavrushin alleys, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed to cars - the Ordynsk dead end, the Great and Small Tolmachevi alley, the Kadashevskiy waterfront and the Bolotsk Square.
Traffic in the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not restricted.
On Friday Street, from the lobby of Novokuznetskaya to the Klimentovski alley, pedestrian conditions were created without removing traffic and cutting the carriageway, transmitting newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian area were the Tretakow Gallery, the temple of the priest Clement of the Pope, museums, libraries, monuments, and other sights.
Previously, the Tverka Pass, Stolashnikov alleys and Kuznets Street had become fully pedestrian.
The big Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian area opened in early September, decided to shut down cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson hacked the phone to check the confidential message.
A former editor of News of the World, Andy Coulson, allegedly used “a phone break, surveillance, and confrontation” in an attempt to corroborate false information about Charles Clark’s novel as Home Secretary at the time.
The Prosecutor, King's Counsel Andrew Edys, told the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005, News of the World had received false news that Clark was meeting with her "attractive special advisor" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulker to hack Paulie’s voice mail and watch her outside for an interview, but Coulson also called her and left voicemails, ” heard the court.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand outside someone's house, hoping to surprise someone, he is the person who likes to offer history to people to see what they say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said that News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: breaking phones, tracking and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone break-in?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
Rumors of Clark's novel first caught the attention of the News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Paulie was told, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
A tape containing voice messages received from her phone at least three times was taken from Mulkeir's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private detective's computer that included Ms. Polby and her sister as "Projects."
During the period she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby ' s grandparents received anonymous calls requesting information about her, said Mr. Edis.
At that time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Wezerap were monitoring Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and which I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edis said that Coulson's involvement in the story was the same as that of other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blankett over an affair with a married woman while he himself was meeting with the corresponding Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with other people to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulker, Turlbeck, and Wezerap confessed to hacking phones.
Snowden says he's ready to talk to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany about the wiretapping case.
An ex-CIA officer, Edward Snowden, expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with the authorities in Germany, transmits RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA official to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by the Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebel, through which Snowden conveyed the message to the German authorities.
Strabele met Snowden in Moscow the previous day.
Four people were injured in a fire on Tver Street
Four passers-by were injured as a result of a fire in a collector in the centre of Moscow, on Tver Street.
According to Interfax, with reference to a source in the emergency services, one of the victims has been hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-by during the smoked underground crossing was injured.
According to RIA News, with reference to Pavel Livinsky, head of the Metropolitan Department of Fuel and Energy, electricity is now completely restored in all houses on Tver Street.
The fire at the heat collector near 15 Tver Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
There was heavy smoke coming out of the storm drains, and the underground crossing near the Armania store was smoked.
Eleven houses on Tver Street were destroyed as a result of the fire.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
The US is cutting food aid for the poor.
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday, the U.S. has been reducing the financial supply of food stamps known as “foodstamps” as the government’s programme ends.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be allocated $36 per month less than previously, and is spoken by officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, the per capita allowance averaged $133 per month.
Expenditure on food aid in the United States rose to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans rely on free food aid from foodstamps that have been called since they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts in the funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should be targeted at those who need it most.
Food store owners across America are concerned that cuts will reduce consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to debate how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platformer free of charge.
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform free of charge on PC.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game became available on Battle.net in the classic Blizzard games.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts relate to the American part of the service are currently able to download it.
The game is also not available to Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally appeared on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day, dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright king of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death by being sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak's minions and protect the planet's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after renaming Blizzard Entertainment.
It was previously called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne's publisher was Interplay.
There's gonna be new automatics on the Moscow subway.
But they're not selling tickets to passengers for money, they're selling tickets for seats.
One trip of 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger 30 seats.
The number of seats will be calculated using modern technology, and ITAR-TASS reports on the Russian Olympic Committee press service.
The first machine will be installed at the Exhibition Station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new ticket sports, the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia, Alexander Zhukov, and the Olympic champions of the Aleksei Nemov gymnast and Elena Zalowchikova will take part.
Recognitions by the National Security Agency reinforce corporate paranoia with regard to State surveillance
On a warm afternoon in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to instructions from the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service was tasked with photographing the roof of the United States Mission building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say that BfV was hoping to find antennas of listening devices, which led to talks between the US and the German Foreign Office in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, again assured that the US did not use foreign intelligence “to steal the commercial secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a whistleblower, has begun to publish his treasure of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been monitoring the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has gained access to data held by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had probably been tapped for about ten years.
If Europe’s most influential person is likely to be targeted, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made clear the intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it's quite likely that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grun, president of the BITMI association, which represents Germany’s small and medium IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US now poses almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
All the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, have so far shown no evidence that the US has passed on the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain information technology and Internet capabilities and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses are skeptical about it.
Someone in the German parliament says we have to create German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gusso Plattner, president of a German software supplier company for SAP.
If there is a need for a strong European IT industry, we should not have let it die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everyone except the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical development of US spy agencies, known by Snowden’s revelations, shocked some companies that previously thought that China’s biggest surveillance risk was China.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-United States members have abandoned their plans to use a cloud service provider in the United States, following the discovery of the American software for an intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Sneib, one of the executive directors of SAP, said, "We see consumers asking a new question that didn't arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are merely proof of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
It is not surprising that economic espionage is taking place.
It's always happened.
“This has been the subject of debate for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we're spying on them, too, because it's in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about the responses they have taken, as this may give an advantage to the enemy.
Large companies have long learned that taking a free flash drive to an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is at least indiscreet.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi automotive company, says that it has been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The Federal Office for the Protection of the German Constitution recommends that company managers consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during overseas travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their particular niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” warns BfV.
The US warns its own companies of economic espionage from other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Report placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second series of violators who hack into economic intelligence after China, claiming The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Scarcini, former head of the French DCRI Internal Intelligence Agency, reportedly stated in an interview this month: “The Service knows very well that all countries, even when cooperating in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a teenage boy from Georgia who died by “a ridiculous accident” believe that their son was murdered.
The parents of a Georgian teenager whose body was found inside a broken sports mat in his high school gymnasium believe that their son was murdered, stated a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Waldosta, Georgia, was found on January 11, in a vertical mat behind the podiums in his high school gymnasium.
The Loundes County Sheriff's Department investigators concluded that Johnson died by tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family is challenging it.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” says FoxNews.com, Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says.
“They think it's contrary to logic, the laws of physics, and common sense,” Crump said.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of the crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll look into all the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to know the truth.
“I am of the view that there are sufficient grounds” for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxiation".
The second autopsy, however, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
“There are a few questions that should be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he'll ask the FBI to do it.
The county sheriff's office was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to publish all the surveillance cameras that the investigators were looking at.
Teenager’s parents said they hoped that the videos contained the key to finding out how he died.
"Spartacus": For information on persons who displayed fascist symbols
On the official website of Spartacus, the Moscow club announced the appearance of a fascist flag at the rostrum of Yaroslavla.
On October 30, at the Shinnik Cup, Spartacus, unknown provocators at the Yaroslavl stadium displayed fascist symbols.
We call on all those who have reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence to provide it
“Remuneration is guaranteed”, says the statement.
We're looking for fans who posted a fascist flag in Yaroslavl.
Remember that in the 1/16 final match of the Russian Cup, Shinnik - Spartacus - was interrupted several times because of unrest on the podiums.
Also in the Spartacus fan sector, fascist symbols were displayed.
Spartacus can spend about three games without an audience as a punishment.
There will be a meeting of the committee on Friday.
If you have any information about who carried and posted this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued guidance to schools on children ' s allergies
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of nutritional allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the incidence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The manual provides information to schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and service staff of food allergies in children and how to help in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep stocks of adrenaline — most often used for injections with EpiPen automatic medical syringes — to help with potentially lethal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended the regulations to allow schools to make stocks of adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "It feels like something's sticking into my tongue," "it feels like I have hair on my tongue," or "language stings."
Parents of intersex children can choose “uncertain sex”
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with intermediate sexual organs.
Newborns will no longer have to be attributed to male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any sex of such children, allowing parents to specify gender as “uncertain” or “unidentified” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to relieve pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions about the sex-abortion operation and to counteract discrimination against intersex persons.
One intersex man, according to BBC, said many years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'll stay doctor-made artefact with bruises and scars.
Approximately one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexity, one of some 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed as “sexual developmental disorders”, a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed sexual organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still not well understood, but most experts in the US say that if gender cannot be defined, it is better to use and assign all available information than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of a child before an operation is performed, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said that the new German law “would sound like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children do not,” he said.
You can embezzle the floor without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are gay.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their condition was not gender-related but related to their biological structure, which was not exclusively male or female, and was typical of both or was not characteristic of either of them.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and body formation; primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosome and hormone structures.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Boys with gender issues now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to place male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first person to be considered “saveless” by standing in court to retain “uncertain” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F — X, i.e. intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to France 24 news.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also disagreed with German law, stating that “in a situation where the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also informed the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have children set sex at birth.
“Moving a child is hard enough and without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,” she said to the parent website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital organs were called hermaphrodites, a beautiful Greek god with both genders.
And just a decade ago, the medical community saw gender as a sheet on which to erase everything and then draw it again.
But now many are challenging the ethical basis for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how a child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called an emergency psychiatric case,” Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist; you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was proposed by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily changeable.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social signals — the way parents raise a child — interact with the genes and hormones of a child, determining whether a person would consider himself or herself to be a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during a careless circumcision to castrate the child completely, removing his testicles as well, and to raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Dresher said that now some doctors are still "using this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these gender-change operations claimed themselves to be “dissatisfied with the outcome.”
This was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes of XY, but with intermediate-type genitals.
The doctors were unable to determine whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a man’s “full life.”
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external sex organ and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCnews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned vaginoplasty.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he demanded medical records.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to develop his genitals normally.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, receiving shots of testosterone and removing his breasts.
Surgery has rendered him barren.
Today, he defends others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexity.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California Law Association, Advocates for Informationed Choice, is concerned that German law “encourages labeling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give the child `uncertain sex'”, she said.
We're afraid he'll help us intervene.
We think it's best to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law because “it allows adults to choose the third sex”.
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex,” she says.
German law implies her at birth.
This is a battle that little children should not engage in at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammologist-rentgenologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter who is sexually challenged and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law would “support” both parents and children.
Her daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called "a complete anti-androgen syndrome".
Because her androgenic receptors don't work properly, Katie has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
At the age of 29, Katie is married and has a residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and to understand the situation, as well as the length of time before they write "male" or "female".
In that case, you are fine — raise the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they do not feel they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide with what sex he or she is more comfortable with — and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
The goalkeeper of Chicago, Nikolai Habibulin, stressed that he understood that he had to play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two Hawks meetings, Habibulin first missed six Tampa Bay pucks and then four Ottawa pucks, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missing puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I haven't done it, CSNhisago quotes Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in my training, so I should probably look at them as games and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel pretty good about training.
But somehow, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The goalkeepers, I don't think I'm the only one, always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I don't like it.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so many pucks.
It's great that my one-slubs are supportive, but basically it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games isn't the whole season, but I wanted to spend it much better.
But it happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'm just gonna try to play the next game better.
There's a bus on Altai.
In the Rubtsovsky district of Altai Kray, a PAZ bus was turned over.
As a result of the accident, 13 people were reported to the MES Regional Office as having been affected.
Previously, 10 victims had been reported by law enforcement agencies in the region.
According to the agency, the accident occurred around 9 a.m. local time on the Novonikolaevka-Vishnevka highway, one kilometre from Novonikolaevka.
The bus from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka contained 12 passengers and a driver, all of whom suffered injuries of varying degrees of severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven of the victims were taken to Rubtsovsk City Hospital No. 1, and two were hospitalized at Rubtsovska CRS.
Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that, once established in Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe as well.
“We expect a total of more than 170 aircraft of this type to receive such arrangements,” quotes Interfax, quoted by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of Russia at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that serious cooperation had been established with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have been discussing some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once the aircraft is strengthened in Latin American markets and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be brought to France," said the Russian Premier.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft that was built by the Civil Air Force in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner is based on state-of-the-art technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the 100-passenger segment.
Dnipropetrovsk energy has started a unique program to save... the storks' nests.
In the old days, to bring the storks to the court, the high - column villagers set up a wheel from the cart, and the heavy nest was well on it.
Such special poles have long been abandoned, so storks have become fond of the poles of the power lines — the interlocking branches rely on the wires, so that the real house is secure.
Anja’s grandmother, whose home in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikov district has been inhabited by a true family for 20 years, began to notice the nest settling despite the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new twigs on top, and the bottom layer is already in between the wires, and it's about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity to have a family of storks nesting at a marina every year, raising and feeding three or four chicks over the summer, but I don't want to be left without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warmth, Anja’s grandmother called the Tsarician REC, which owns the pillar.
I didn't even expect to be able to react so quickly.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, as DTK Dneproblenergo's technical director, Sergei Berezovsky, said.
The wires, which were in fact already inside a nest weighing 150 to 200 kilograms, began to corrode.
At any moment, the birds could have died from electric shocks.
And the locals risked losing their light because of the damage to the wires.
Therefore, the Liner Mounters have launched a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
An ornithology scientist from Dnipropetrovsk National University helped develop a nest relocation scheme.
They also conducted training sessions for district network staff.
Alexander Ponomarenko, a well-known Ddopropetrovsk ornithologist, consulted energy experts at all stages of the redevelopment of the nests.
For starters, it was estimated that there were more than 50 authentic “housings” in the area in dangerous condition.
Special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded to reconstruct them.
The base was soaked with willow branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
In the opinion of scholars, it is enough to lay down the old branches as a basis for birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Then the storks will finish their own place.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Pesčanka in the Novomoskov district.
A new concrete pillar was placed next to the electric pole and a platform with an old, existing nest was placed on it.
The entire operation cost nine thousand hryvnias of energy.
And the other day, the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikovsky district at Anja's grandmother's house.
This is where the platform was fixed to its original location, but it was raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their “housing” has been overhauled.
By the end of the year, four more nests in the Pokrovski and Tsarichan districts of Dnipropetrovski will be under reconstruction.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others kill them mercilessly.
The other day, the whole area was covered by sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka in the Apostolic region, the day the pheasant hunt was opened, poachers shot and killed a swan family living in a local pond for fun.
The noble birds were not at all afraid of humans, who were fed and not wronged by the local inhabitants.
When the villagers heard the shots and ran to the pond, the four beautiful lions were already dead on the water.
The Apostolic Police Department is now investigating who shot the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian March is getting more popular.
On November 4, the Day of People's Unity will be held in Moscow, as agreed with the municipality of the Russian March.
According to a survey of the Levada Centre, support for the Russian marches is increasing, with 40 per cent of citizens endorsing them to varying degrees.
According to the Levada Centre, 40 per cent of citizens approve the Russian marches to varying degrees: 11 per cent are definitely positive and 29 per cent are “promptly positive”.
The popularity of the Russian Marches is gradually increasing, with only 14 per cent of Russians welcoming them in 2006 and twice as many (28 per cent) supporting them in December 2010.
Only 7% of Russians are “specifically negative” and 19% “most likely negative” are “Russian marches”.
Another 35 per cent were unable to formulate their views on the action.
This year, Moscow City City has agreed to hold a “Russian March” of up to 15,000 people in Lublino, which was reported today by the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majorov.
This nationalist action has taken place every year on the Day of People ' s Unity since 2005.
When asked by sociologists, “Did you hear that Russian marches are held in Russia on 4 November under the slogans of protecting Russian rights in Russia?” three quarters (75%) of citizens responded negatively.
Only one in five Russians (20 per cent) know about this event.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost one third of citizens (31 per cent) heard about the Russian Marches.
It will be recalled that three years ago, on 11 December, a nationalist gathering took place in Manezya Square, which turned into a riot.
The Levada Centre also asked Russians what holiday was celebrated on 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the correct answer (People's Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15 per cent of the citizens attend the celebration.
About the same number (17 per cent) intend to celebrate November 7th of the October Revolution.
The majority of citizens (62 per cent) do not intend to celebrate any of these holidays.
As Moscow City City agreed on the Russian March in Lublino
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March on 4 November in Lublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Russians, the organizer of the march, Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the Lublino march, there will be a rally and a rock concert of the Kollovrat group on People's Unity Day, also agreed with the authorities.
How was the Russian March 2012?
On the Day of People ' s Unity in 2012, the nationalists marched from the Yakimana waterfront to the Central House of Artists, where a rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20,000 and the Ministry of Internal Affairs referred to the figure of 6,000.
Message: Obama’s campaign headquarters was considering Biden’s exclusion in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, immediate advisors to President Barack Obama were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the most vivid sensation of all the expected book by Mark Halperin and John Hailemann on the 2012 campaign "The Stacks Doubled: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times received a copy of a book to be released and reported on Thursday evening that the immediate assistant presidents had conducted “large-scale focus groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Biden’s exclusion could help raise the waning hopes for Obama’s re-election.
According to political commentator The Times, Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by senior campaign and White House officials, former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daily, to assess the impact of the election of former Secretary Clinton as Vice-President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded at Chicago Election Headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers — including Daley, former head of Obama's campaign staff, Jim Messinu, and former White House senior advisers, David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book "The Stacks Doubled" claims that Daley initiated an attempt to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship," but eventually abandoned this step when their data showed that Clinton's addition to the electoral roll would not “enhanced Obama's substantial chances.”
In an interview with Martin Daily, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I have been actively advocating for a lot of things, and this was one of them,” Daily said to the paper.
You must remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what do we do?"
Although Daley described the study as a “necessary test”, Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the campaign staff had invested quite a lot in exploring whether this step would pay off the vote.
“Pre-election headquarters don’t spend that kind of money on polls and focus groups unless they’re serious about something,” Martin said in AK 360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about a possible shuffle.
Even though Daley said he didn't think the president was "intelligible" for a possible replacement, the former chief of administration admitted that maybe Obama knew.
Martin added that "The Stacks are Doubled" does not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political sensing have reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama wasn't aware of a study on the possibility of removing Biden from the electoral list.
“Possibly,” Martin replied.
Would you like a glowing ice cream in the dark?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first dark, glowing ice cream with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with this idea by reading a scientific article on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate a glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the language of the eater, raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the warmth of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company, Lise Me, I'm Delicious, says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at an early stage, in terms of production, so for £200, you'll get about 2 g of substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, it'll raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the luminescence of a jellyfish is four times the price of gold.
So every balloon costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and slurry gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop invisible ice cream."
It's by definition impossible because of the refractions caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
Avangarda coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking of preparing his team for the regular KHL championship against Salavata, noted that Omichi had conducted a thorough analysis of the damage caused by the Magnogical Metallurga.
The expert stressed that the Avangard should pay more attention to the defense game.
We watched a video match against the M.M.M. Metallurga, which is given by Chebaturkin's official "Avangard" website.
- Missed a lot of pucks, not a good time.
Missed because of their mistakes, because they didn't play the game.
We knew the opponent had performers.
Statistically, they've had five attacks from the move-- three pucks beat us up.
Very good implementation.
Were these errors taken into account in the preparations for today's game?
Me and the guys, every match is carefully sorted, we talk after the game, we're getting ready for a new rival.
All that matters is that the installation is being carried out.
Everyone saw the first round of the match against Metallurg.
The game assignment was completed, and the score was 2-0.
Missed the goal in the locker room, and in the third period, they started making mistakes.
Given how hard the game was, I didn't see the point in connecting the defense team.
We need to get down on the whole team.
Now the Avangarde has a long home series, the matches go on in a day-- the team's getting tired?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The most important thing now is to fulfill your moments and perform your game assignment.
Hockey's an emotional game, if you're doing the set, it's not that hard.
Because of the new regulations introduced by the Russian Customs, hundreds of furs have been standing in line on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drinking water to drivers and install biotubes.
Hundreds of furs have accumulated at the border crossings into Russia.
This situation was caused by the amendment of the rules on Customs clearance.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm that the Russian side is making a turn and has not given advance warning of innovations.
Since 28 October, the Russian Customs authorities have been applying additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, as reported by Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Head of Eastern Customs.
The new model document is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The crossing points are operating in a high-speed mode.
FACTOV's correspondent visited the border and spoke with truckers who were held hostage.
Prices at the Novoazovsk road shop at the crossing point are rising daily, as is the turn of the Fur.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two kilometres.
The Novoazovsk-Veselo-Veszenka customs terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, cargo is being shipped to Stavropolis, Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sunday, until midnight, and after the introduction of these rules, a trucker named Alexei Golovanov (in a photo) is in transit from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
By the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and a payment for cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance to which it is transported.
The minimum insurance is 4.5 to 5,000 roubles (about 1,100 to 1,300 hryvnias).
Those who travel not far (say Georgia, Armenia) with a load of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 rubles (3,800 hryvnias) and pass.
And the rest of them are stuck - no one has that much money on them!
Imagine if a driver takes only $4,000 worth of cargo, but all the way to Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (almost 23,000 hryvnias) to pay for his transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - none - are lamented by the truckers who eat near their cars.
Border stores and cafes are always expensive, but we've never seen a price like this!
The sellers were oriented and quickly turned them on: 15 grivins are worth a bar, seven grivins are for a cup of coffee, and 25 griwens are for a plate of soup.
There's only one coffee shop.
There's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the bathroom.
No bathing, no shave...
I can stay out of the car for a week, my wife's got everything ready for me on the way.
One week, another trucker, Victor Skotarenko, comforts himself.
Will my car get a turn in a week?
How much do you have a liter of water?
There's 11 and 15 hryvnias each.
What, is the bottle crystal or is the water on the silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take it while there's something else, the saleswoman's fighting.
When the situation began to be covered in the media, Ukrainian drivers were drawn to the attention of the authorities in the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosii and Novoazov Riyadsad were instructed to provide drinking water to all those who remained in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border, as stated by the Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Oblast Administration, Sergei Dergunov.
Ambulance teams are on duty at the checkpoints now.
Biotuals will also be installed for the convenience of humans.
According to the official, the issue of queues will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the Press Service of the Donetsk Authority, 32 vehicles and 68 vehicles, respectively, were standing at the international checkpoints “Uspenka” and “Novoazovsk” on 31 October.
The “facts” will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president.
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries, a statement made to BNS by the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information has been published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to “speak” to the President of Lithuania, Dal Gribauskaite, and publish falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosarhive concerning facts from the curriculum vitae of the Lithuanian leader.
According to intelligence services, the Department of Analysis of Public Processes of the Office of the President of Russia on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is preparing an information attack.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerkov, who has visited Lithuania on several occasions and participated in the Lithuanian People's Party Convention.
A member of the department of V. Smirnov is also alleged to be involved.
According to Smirnov, under cover of scientific work, he regularly travelled to Lithuania until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov is now prohibited from entering the country.
The previous day, the President of Lithuania, Gribauskaite, stated that she knew about the information she was preparing.
In her view, the main reason was Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and the country's “promising energy independence”
The Lithuanian leader has previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities more than once.
In this way, she stated that Lithuania was “not sufficiently respected” in the Kremlin.
Moreover, Gribauskaite accused Vladimir Putin, head of the Russian Federation, of bringing “one demand only” to Lithuania.
Remember, Rospornadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia in September.
It was reported that the quality of the products did not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
At that time, the leader of Lithuania stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the United States, the school's headmaster shot teenagers.
The headmasters of an American high school have literally led teenagers to despair.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, young bullies threw toilet paper at a man's house.
As a result, the headmaster of the school opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not on the property of the director, he was charged with aggravated assault.
A man was released from prison on bail at $125,000.
Note that shooting at civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the previous day, a man opened fire in the middle of Ridgecrest, in the U.S. state of California, just across the street.
The perpetrator then took two bystanders hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier in the elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, there was a shooting.
Adam's mom worked at school, she was a teacher.
Shots fired at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on 31 January at an American school, this time in Anlanth, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and make a masquerade for our neighborhood.
Now I'm more of a scrapper.
I haven't been asked to hand out candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I'm probably not going to do it this year.
However, statistics show that I'm a white crow as far as Halloween is concerned.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — 158 million — will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and jewelry.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is the trends.
The National Retail Federation projects that the costumes will cost $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion spent.
This year, at the peak of fashion, sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to be sexual workers; they may also be sex foods, such as pizzas, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies through the Walking Dead, and I'm sure the Daft Punk astronauts will be on our Instagram tapes this year.
Google reports that the suits most often sought are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed up our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
That means a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't change.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, candy, Milk Duds candy, Twizzlers chewing candy, and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-seeking children who are ready to conquer our neighborhoods.
Moreover, we will buy and — let us not deceive ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is candy in the form of cornseeds; yet, according to the National Pastry Association, almost 35 million pounds are sold for Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I still have to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween more than a haunted house.
They have amazing names, such as "The Wrath Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Way and Cry" and "The House of Shock".
Moreover, according to American Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted homes in America that generate about $500 million in income, as well as those amazing photos where you almost peed, which your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't remove, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like "classy facial expression."
And in conclusion, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting out Jack's lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, pumpkin baby fashion only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out those pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack's lamp, slowly drying out on your porch, probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want more difficult tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try cutting something out of their 2032 pound pumpkin.
The site of the Estonian Ministry of Defence was restored after an attack by Ukrainian hackers.
The website of the Estonian Ministry of Defence was restored after a cyber attack in the morning, and the Department's press service reports.
According to the Department of Defense's Vice Chancellor for Information and Administration, Tymar Petercop, it was a primitive attack, and the site was just overloaded with a lot of queries.
Our experts quickly set things up, and so far the site has been restored.
“The damage to the Ministry is minimal,” Petercop said to the Postimes.
According to Petercop, it's too early to talk about who staged the attacks.
“We will certainly analyse the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is absolutely impossible to prevent such incidents,” he admitted.
On November 1, the Anonymous Ukraine group posted a message in which they confirmed a hacker attack on the Estonian Ministry of Defence website and opposed a partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We shouldn't be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need a NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," says Anonymous.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine reported that a company of the Marine Corps of the Teodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps would participate in the NATO response force command and staff exercises Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Several schools and hospitals had to be closed because of the violence of unclean force
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of Southern Matabeleland had to be closed because students had been attacked... by goblins.
According to the local elder, the children were panicking and it was impossible to continue their studies.
A story about goblins may sound like a child's fiction to a European, but in Africa, it is a serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, a hospital was closed down in Zimbabwe because medical staff were also attacked by goblins.
Announced the Land Rover race series
Inside are racing seats and six-point safety-belts, as well as an internal communication system.
Advanced brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support, and car storage between events are also available.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said, "Rally participants turning to Bowler have changed."
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventures, and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer such a way, in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines of the Rally in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the Rally Ride.
We were very happy to develop a Defender Challenge car -- it's gonna be a really exciting championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian silos don't know anything about the Bratsky Circle - New News.
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After the media reported that the U.S. Department of the Treasury had placed Leps on the watch list on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate of the Bratsky Circle, we looked at all the databases, but no such grouping was found,” said the agency’s interviewee.
In his view, the dissemination of this information helped to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operated abroad.
As previously written by N.I., yesterday the U.S. Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the Bratsky Circle criminal group.
Among them was Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He's on the list as Grisha, posted the day before.
They match the data of a popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Grigory Lepsevridze, the creative alias, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five other people are mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, an Uzbek citizen and another from the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
The U.S. believes that Grigory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, transported money for the bandits on their order.
A photograph of the singer is attached to the present report and all the details are given that are true.
In fact, Lepes did recently buy a house on Phuket.
The agency indicated that it intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The blacklisting of a person by the U.S. Ministry of Finance has resulted in the freezing of his assets in the United States and a ban on business with him by persons residing in the United States.
Leps Maia Serikova's assistant said that there were no notices to the singer: "It's hard to answer the question of whether it's Grigory, the one everyone's talking about right now in the US scandal."
All Leps knows is media information.
Officially, there was no notification to him, although I don't know if there are any in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all funny on the one hand, and surprising and unexpected on the other," she said to RIA News.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live on Phuket, but according to the U.S. Ministry of Finance, he does have a home on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that news had caught him on his flight to the city of Enlightenment.
Runnin' out on the field in the Shinnick game.
Some details have come to light on the identity of the fan who ran out on the field during the 1/16 final match of the Russian Cup between the Jaroslav “Shinnik” and the Moscow “Spartacus”.
According to the head of the KDC, Arthur Grigoryantz, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the fan is a Moscowian.
He's in custody right now.
"Aside from this, Grigoryantz told us how the fan managed to break through the field: "It was discovered that this one, called an audience, went to an ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He went to the E.R. - that was confirmed by the E.R. doctor.
And then he pushed two escorts away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the Eastern and Southern rostrum to the corner of the Eastern and Northern rostrum.
He ran through the field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Until the entry into force of the Sports Act, it's a steward's area - the police can't interfere with what's on the field.
He ran to the rostrum, went over the Eastern rostrum.
And at that time there was rioting on the Eastern Tribune and the treadmills," said the head of the KDC.
Let us recall that, by decision of the KDC, Moscow's "Spartacus" will hold the upcoming 15th round of Russia's championship against Locomotive and Zenita, and will also pay a fine of 600,000 roubles.
Fire brigades were called to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground at a dangerous threshold in his career.
Coker-Spaniel Ruby ran away after she was in a small car accident.
Three days later, she was stuck in a career, spotted by a man walking a dog.
Firemen came down a rope on a steep slope to save the dog from imminent destruction.
The puppy was lucky enough to be rescued after fire brigades were summoned to pick him up and get him to a safe place, after he somehow got stuck at 50 feet on the dangerous slope of the hindsight.
Ruby's nine-month-old Cocker-Spaniel escaped from a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at Flappit's quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and were thanked by the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were searching for their missing dog and posting messages on social media websites after she ran off to a quarry after a small accident.
At around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a watchful dog driver spotted Ruby stuck at an altitude of 50 feet in a career.
A technical rescue team from the Clekhiton fire station rushed to the scene, went down on ropes to save Ruby, and used a transporter to lift her up the slope.
A rescue officer named Andy Clayton said, "She was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of a steep slope -- 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move her muscle during the rescue, she's completely frozen.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
A rescue officer named Peter Lau said, "Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued."
There was a possibility that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination, and was found to be in good condition, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “The watch was scary”.
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when we got her back in our hands.
The vet said if she was exhausted and passed out, she'd probably fall.
The fire department was great.
It was very brave — what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Kitley added: “We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there”.
The fire department was amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't flirt with Katie Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, a pop star stated that she was a back vocalist for the 2004 Jagger song Old Habits die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a rocker veteran and said, "He was flirting with me when I was 18.
She added: “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for 70-year-old Jagger said that he “adamantly denied that he had ever hit Katy Perry”.
The representative added: “It may be that she confuses it with someone else”.
Perry was one of the artists who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another independence scare.
This time, we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the European free movement zone as a condition of EU membership.
There is a series of passport control stories in Berwick and a border with barbed wire along the Adrianov Vale.
True, Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movements across the rest of Europe, although — predictablely — it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has anyone pointed out that EU member countries spend much time turning their formal rules in a way that is convenient to them.
As Scotland is now outside the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels to replace what it really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not an interesting story.
And so old that it has become fossilized: for the first time, I heard the “slut” that “independence means passport control”, at least 40 years ago.
Still, there's an interesting moment lost in the old story.
Why does independent Scotland have to obey orders from Europe?
Why change London's yoke to Brussels's, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the Eurocrysis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the “Alternative for Germany” party of Euroskeptics, founded only this year, emerged out of nowhere and won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus effectively displacing the “Free Democrats” (similar to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency have led many people to believe that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis had little to do with the fact that national governments were operating with excessive budget deficits — that was true only for Greece.
In fact, the Euro-system blocked its members at exchange rates beneficial to German exporters, which German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself at a pre-eminent disadvantage in terms of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only life-saving option is to cut wages and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current fiscal and currency problems is the deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacity.
As a result of the green energy package introduced by Brussels — a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers — the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
It's a paralysing unfavourable price conditions, as we've seen in Granjmut.
No global wage freeze will stop the devastating victory of cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a riot, especially in France, once the strongest supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and place Paris at the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s shattered economy in distress.
The result is that Marín Le Pen’s right-wing anti-EU party, the “National Front”, has just won a decisive by-election, dropping the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote — a timely warning to British Laborists that it cannot be assumed that a split among the right would automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If — and this is very likely — anti-EU parties are supported in these elections, such a bloc will be able to dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my opinion: soon the rising moods against the EU and against a single currency in Europe will merge to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something of a vague “Europe (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I assume that Britain is distanced from this project, hoping to get close to the US.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain is likely to be neglected in the cold of the Atlantic.
What situation does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in effect) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will succeed in a more freer European arrangement, provided that we preserve our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is, surprisingly, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which gained an impressive majority of votes in 2011 as a result of opposition to the cuts proposed (and realized) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent coalition of thorie and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence just to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: early ageing
African American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity before their white peers do research.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity can be a trigger mechanism for early puberty.
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys
CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened if her daughter begins to develop breast conceptions and develop pubic hair at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time comforting my parents — usually it doesn’t mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity,” Caplovitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and the smell of the body, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in menarche age (the first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two to three years to menarche,” said Caplovitz, who is also the author of the book Early Maturity in Girls: How to Cope with this common problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a discussion of what is the actual onset of puberty but is considered “premature” when breast growth is accompanied by a sharp increase to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop — something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progress can be the basis for endocrinologist tests to avoid major problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can eventually lead to stunting and low growth in adulthood.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, level of development, growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is careful about medication, but admits that “the inhibition of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the perception of girls that they are different from their peers.”
Another big problem is that parents just don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will cope with hygiene issues,” Caplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter began her menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other food products, environmental chemicals or sexual messages in the media.
In boys, as in girls, puberty is early.
Caplovitz claims that the precept that has the greatest weight is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, it helped to conduct a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age, which linked the amount of fat in the body to the period of puberty.
Other evidence supports this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
There are various explanations.
Around the world, early puberty is likely to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery is that although boys have hair on their faces and pubes at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of pimples and pubic hair occurs even in infants and nursery children.
“We must be careful how we define the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at Gorieb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from a pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This may mean earlier than expected conversation,” Caplovitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when they do so early, this process is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing, stuck in Chita, is preparing to fly out.
The United States aircraft under the Treaty on Open Skies over Russian territory, which made an unplanned landing in Chita on Wednesday on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 Moscow time, will leave the city’s air harbour.
The airport authorities allowed the flight to take the money for the fuel.
It was reported at the airport that the plane will fly to Ulaanbaatar.
According to other sources, he's going to the U.S.
The plane that flew to Ulaanbaatar reportedly landed in Zabaikala Krai because of fog.
He wasn't released from Chita Airport because of the unpaid bills.
There are 30 people on board, including a crew, who spent two nights on the premises of the airport, ITAR-TASS reports.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under the terms of the Treaty on Open Skies, persons on board an aircraft have no right to leave Chita airport, but only two Russian airports, in Kubinka and Ulaanbaatar.
The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992, with 34 States parties.
Observation flights are taking place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, to help monitor the implementation of arms control agreements, and to enhance the capacity for crisis prevention and resolution within OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the late celebrities make - MK in the U.S.
The ranking of the highest-income living celebrities in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income was 160 million from October 2012 to October 2013.
Notably, he is behind other out-of-life celebrities who made a few times less money last year.
Forbes magazine's second list of the most "conservable" retired celebrities, released in the year, was Elvis Presley's 55 million in a year, and a line below Peanuts comics by Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, who was last year's leader (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million) entered the first five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein were also on the list.
The first boutique of Igor Guliev opened in Moscow.
On October 23, Igor Guliev's first flagship boutique was discovered in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulayev is known to the general public for his magnificent articles from luxury fur.
And now they'll be able to appreciate even more fashion fans - his first boutique finally opened in Moscow, about which the designer had a dolce vita party.
I'm sure there are the most beautiful girls in Russia.
So I am especially glad that I have opened a shop in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's exactly how Igor cut the red tape and invited anyone who wanted to... try on the models he saw!
Jet manufacturers are in conflict with seat width when big orders are at stake.
There was a heated debate among the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of long-distance seats, setting the tone for a violent confrontation at the Dubai Airport this month.
The controversy revolves around the width of seats available on long-distance flights to economy-class passengers, whose interests are not always the focus of airlines, while the space allocated to them plays a key role in the assertions about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide a minimum seat width of 18 inches (46 cm) in economy rooms, but its main American competitor Boeing says that airlines must decide.
There is a dispute at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in selling increasingly large versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at the 17-21 November event.
The composition of the back of the aircraft — especially whether 9 or 10 people sit in rows — is central to the statements on the cost-effectiveness of new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economic class over 17 inches wide, with 10 rows in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economy class in 18-inch seats.
Flight giants often exchange technical strikes through professional press advertisements.
And now Airbus is reaching out directly to the public in front of an air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to be the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the beginning of a new advertising war could be like by showing the financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant pressed against each other, entitled “Would you agree to that?”
"Boeing offers long-distance flights on seats narrower than regional turbovant planes," said Airbus sales manager John Leah.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when wide-body Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-distance travel, and the century’s frontier, the weight of an average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 per cent, according to the US Department of Health.
The coverage of the 21st century average American man is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. Health Service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of the 1950s seats, when the average grip on the waist of those recently called “reactive public” was already in place.
Airbus says she commissioned a study showing that an additional inch in the seat width improves sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus figures for seat sizes and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines can balance tariffs and conveniences.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the passenger compartment does not depend solely on the width of the seat.
“It is really all about giving airlines the choice and the opportunity to do what they think they should do to succeed,” says Boeing in Kent Craver’s salons.
They don't want us to decide for them what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase space on the sides, but for suppliers this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this debate is a race for aircraft orders estimated at at least $700 billion at catalytic prices in the coming decades — enough to alter the ratio of US to European exports.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, seat accommodation is precisely what fuels competition in the battle between the newest jet planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability by one place in their last two-engine long-distance models, compared with the market leader in this segment, 365 local Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared Boeing characteristics are partly based on the comparison of the 10-seat 777X series with the original 9-seat design of the design decision 777.
The gain in unit cost decreases when compared to the 10-seat layout currently in use.
“The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more seats and make his plane more competitive than our designs,” said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins full of 10-season rows for the existing 777 show that many passengers prefer a dense seat that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“Seats 18 inches wide would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view the Airbus proposal is driven by the 777 threat,” said Mary Kirby, an interior designer, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world’s jet sellers even carry roulettes to check competing designs.
By praising comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense structure for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10-season rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications to the cabins, offering wider passages on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but may distract attention from the 777X sales wave.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine can rob the smoking process of pleasure.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the smoking process of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from lifetime nicotine addiction.
Further tests are needed before human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Welle Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to quit by testing all the techniques available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nitrotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And mice that weren't given the vaccine "relaxed," which is a sign that nicotine reached their brains, says researchers,
These experiments are described in Science Transitional Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be made so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibodies factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Olejnikov: one third of the rural settlements in Moscow are fully subsidized
Vice-Governor Yuri Oleinikov, Moscow, stated that almost one third of the rural settlements in the Moscow region were entirely subsidized.
A total of 187 out of 288 settlements receive grants from the region ' s budget.
In 2013, 187 out of 288 settlements received grants from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent is 100 per cent.
As part of the budget, some 25 billion rubles are allocated from the regional budget,” said Oleynikov.
The Vice-Governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Motishy, Odintsovo and Pushkino - had a budget of more than 1 billion roubles in 2013.
The incomes of rural settlements in many areas are less than 3 million roubles, “that is not enough”.
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in Podskovje is over 70 per cent, “with the quality of services falling”, observed Olejnikov.
He had previously instructed the heads of the municipalities of Podskowya to consider, before the end of November, which settlements needed to be consolidated, integrated into urban districts or changed administrative administration.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to that, the Governor of the Moscow Region stated that, as part of the administrative reform in Moscow, there were plans to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
There is also a request for the consolidation of municipalities in the Mojai, Kashire, Solar, Kolomens, Luberts and Kotelnik districts.
Discussions on this issue will begin in the cities and regions of the region in November.
The Chairman of Mosoblduma, Igor Brynzalov, also stated that about 30 rural settlements in 12 regions of Moscow were planned to be integrated into the forthcoming admreform.
This is because of the fact that less than one third of the 178 rural settlements in Moscow have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 have a grant base.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children.
Diana Arbenina doesn't hide how much she enjoys raising her children.
Although it is now that Arbenina devotes a great deal of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to deal with Martha and Artem, not only spending time teaching them, but also entertaining as she can.
In the last week, Diana reported twice to her fans about her teaching skills.
First, she posted on Facebook a picture of her teaching children how to read.
And yesterday, I pampered fans by showing them how Artema and Martha dressed up for Halloween.
That's what Diana called a picture of her children wearing holiday suits.
Which is not wise, because they, like any other Russian boy or girl, are involved in this celebration because they were born in America.
Germany is the first country in Europe to introduce “uncertain sex” when registering children.
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to refer to “uncertain” in the registration of children born to hermaphrodites instead of “male or female”.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the “sex” on the birth certificate for the time being.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male), parents may temporarily write "X" (uncertain).
This decision is intended to prevent parents from rushing into “examining” sex surgery.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born hermaphrodite.
Tripods deny being influenced by Obaid.
Joe Tripody, former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, will be the subject of an investigation into the state's anti-corruption oversight body.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, has denied changes in the lease of offshore facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obaid, who secretly owned shares in three properties on State land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid had lobbied several state ministers for the extension of leases to Sercular Ki, where the Obaid family owned two restaurants and cafes, without a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obaid ' s secret involvement in real estate, following testimony given by Mr. Tripodi Lynn Ashpool, former Deputy Chief of Administration, on Thursday.
For several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be submitted to an open competition.
The tenants were against this and also wanted longer lease periods.
In 2009, the Sercular Key business leases, which brought about $2.5 million per year to the Obeid family, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obaid, who admitted that Mr. Tripodi had strongly recommended changes to the Government ' s rental policy.
ICAC's interpretation of the telephone calls included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dan, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
“Whether the issue discussed during these telephone calls was one of the development of a commercial rental policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willi, Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
A senior administration official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli warplanes attacked a target in the Syrian port city of Ladhiqiyah on Thursday evening.
The official didn't specify what the target was, but said at least one.
Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
On at least two occasions earlier this year, Israel launched air strikes against missiles inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers of Division 457 may be tested for “validity”
The “validity” test for foreign class 457 visa workers is under consideration by the Government, as it envisages an expansion of repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied on the basis of criteria aimed at preventing the use of visas at the level of 457 for unskilled jobs or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The paper submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McQuew criticized the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it might hurt Australia's neighbors.
“Small statements like “foreigners at the end of the line” and “work for Australians at first” represent a very unpleasant setback to times when trade unions demanded a secure labour market,” she said to the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw the backlash of this historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The document before the discussion outlined 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is meeting officials on trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the “validity” criteria are accepted, the applicant for the visa may be examined to determine whether “the applicant is genuine in circumstances where the applicant is a relative or a close acquaintance of the owner or person involved in the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also be required to account for the number of visa holders in Division 457, since previously enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of an alleged heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The victim ' s nine - year - old son accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father ' s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board.
The Australian authorities rushed a man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Semena Varlamova's friend stated that a hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of the hockey player Semen Varlamov Evgeny Vavrinyuk stated that he was suffering from alcoholism, reporting to the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” said a woman in particular.
We will recall that Vavrinyuk filed a lawsuit for beating the Russian team Semen Varlamova, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, a hockey player dragged her by her hair, and also beat her arm, chest, stomach and neck after the attack.
Varlamov himself confessed to Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing the incident in detail.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at $5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete from moving around the country, but prohibited him from approaching Vavrinyuk.
He also faces a prison sentence of up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact for Scotland of the HS2 railway project.
HS2 involves the opening of a high-speed link to Scotland and the north of England, with the start of Phase One in 2026
Baroness Kramer, Minister of Transport, noted that the project would “unify Britain”.
Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said that he was “excited” by the prospect of working with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, the lines will be built in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and North England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and shorter travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal on HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring Britain and its cities closer together."
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But this is also a transport connection between cities and one another; 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive better communications through HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added, "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “unanimously” support the inclusion of Scotland in HS2.
Mr. Brown said: “A high-speed railway has every chance of bringing enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the general argument for a high-speed railway across the UK.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glasgow-Edinburg railway line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with British ministers next year and to jointly deciding on the next steps.
Thorium is a new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
The combustion of hydrocarbons (where they exist) adversely affects the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
The cost of nuclear energy is not the same, but it leaves behind a lot of expensive waste management.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to thorium, another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and its fission, according to experts, does not leave waste that must be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to switch off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite US measures to ease the regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are irritated that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required U.S. airlines to do an enormous amount of work to meet the new requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases were still in place in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Authority does not currently have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft”, it stated.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to ensure safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety regulations communicated to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on board, was not opposed to changes, but stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
“We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's consideration of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it (an wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” the spokesperson said.
Qantas stated that he would abide by the rules currently in force.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change them soon,” she said.
The FAW Regulation applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly look closely at the decision of the FAU and the reasons behind it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the regulation will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as to revise manuals, training materials, regulations for carrying hand baggage and passenger instructions.
“After the airline has checked and confirmed the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones, at any altitude,” FAU stated.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to switch off their devices during landing.
In addition, the group recommended that the heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan hears a note of extremism in Kubani's anthem.
The football match between Angie and Kubanyu resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of Krasnodar Krai and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Kubani anthem sounded differently.
On Thursday, the head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov invited Republican parliamentarians to go to court because the anthem of Krasnodar province allegedly calls for ethnic strife, in particular calling for a war against the Basurmans.
Take the anthem of Krasnodar Krai, which was approved in 1995.
It's a shame, and nobody's doing it.
"You're remembered here as your mother, as your enemy, as a Basurmanine we're going to a battle of death," which is why you write an anthem, poison some believers on other believers," expressed his solidarity with Abdulatype President of Parliament Hizri Shikhsaidov.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, the news from the ocean, from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel attacked Russian-made missiles reportedly destined for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important requirement of destroying its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement brokered by Russia that allowed the US not to carry out the military operation they came close to this summer.
More on the weapons and what this means to the Syrian president, our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel, will tell you.
Washington has stated that the Assad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal made by a friend of Assad, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will renounce its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is a milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had disabled the declared chemical weapons factories.
The longer-term and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say Assad's days were numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer a legitimate and has to leave.
But Assad stays.
And I feel even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His adversaries are divided and poorly armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Al-Assad escaped punishment for the massacre.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement has been described as a success of diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has been impressed by a man ready to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, the US ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, its mother is hardly relieved that he was not killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's holding up for now.
And he's changing his weapon to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has established a separate Ministry of Construction and HKH
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new Ministry responsible for construction and HKH and offered to lead it to former governor Mikhail Menu of Ivanov province in the process of face-to-face meetings.
The President met with Mikhail Men at the residence in Novo Ogarevo, and Men did not refuse to head the new office.
Russian press spokesman Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions relating to construction and HKH were being transferred to a new ministry from the Ministry of the Region.
Mikhail Men, son of a prominent Orthodox priest, the protoyeer Alexander Mea, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petroleum Chemistry, Lipkin.
Since 1995, his political career has begun: he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from Sergievo-Posad district, was a deputy to the State Duma, was the first vice-premier of the Moscow Region Government and vice-premier of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Mehn was governor of Ivanov province.
The pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is having trouble.
In a pawn shop at the Bendemir mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthaling places a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for his daughter's schooling.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested in it,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt is rising, is such that ValueMax, where it makes its deal, became the third pawnshop registered on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Credit on jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but almost as cheap as unfunded bank loans.
Usually, pawnshops in Singapore have an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered at the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a subsidiary at the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require credit or proof of wages and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people throughout the region are turning to pawnshops because families feel pressured by rising costs of living and rapidly rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap loans fuelled by free monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families resort to pawnshops to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, pointed to the increase in family credit, mainly because of the increase in mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list from 80% of GDP to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely recovered from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and in consumer demand.
“The point is that, with rising prices, people in the middle and lower [income scales] will look for ways to supplement their income where they can,” says Song Seng Won, a CIMB economist, a Malaysian bank.
The record high prices of gold in the last two years have increased the haste with which people mortgage their personal belongings because they take advantage of the opportunity to get money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items in the 200 pawnshops of the city-state are gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's put the gold chain on Grandma and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest EastyMoney pawnshop operator has seen an increase in the number of customers using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, a branch operator in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where he has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company will finance expansion using 60 per cent of the S$66 million leveraged this week through the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors had been criticized for high interest rates, she said that the pawnshop did not only offer cheaper tariffs than other creditors, nor did it directly increase debt.
“Clinics mortgage items they already own, and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The mortgage is gaining increasing public acceptance as a means of obtaining short-term, secured financing.
And the pawnshops are not only used by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices by setting up gold bars or Rolex clocks, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy persons who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties”, said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of available health facilities and their status that matters to the population, but the quality of care provided.
The implementation of the “Modernization of Health Care in the Tula Region 2011 - 2013” programme and the reorganization of our city's health facilities will make it possible to establish an optimal structure for the provision of medical care to the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant women and women giving birth.
For example, the integration with the Gordo Hospital has made it even more possible to bring in specialized specialists from the NSAU to consult pregnant women with various pathologies, and to conduct additional hospital-based examinations.
During the modernization programme, the logistical base of the maternity ward has been significantly improved and modern equipment has been developed to meet world standards.
During these years, approximately 8 million roubles were allocated for major maintenance of premises, and 112 items of equipment worth 42 million roubles were purchased.
The most up-to-date equipment is an intensive post for newborns.
In the operating room, the Caesarean section uses the Sel-Saver machine, which collects blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, returns it to the woman giving birth, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
The Clinical Laboratory Diagnostic Unit is also equipped with modern equipment.
The women ' s clinic has an electronic registry, and the introduction of electronic patient maps and medical records is planned for the near future.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, women giving birth and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The Chechens were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been under way since March this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes in a Strasbourg hotel and then beat and robbed them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old previously tried Chechen.
"Bavaria's protector David Alabama became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reporting on the official Bundesliga website.
In this debate, he has outperformed winter sports, which have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by the skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third was by the skier Gregor Schliensauer.

A $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's health
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for Tasmania’s weakened health system will be supplemented by stringent conditions that guarantee that the state government will not waste money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plybersec announced that the Commonwealth was taking “urgent action” to prevent a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, higher levels of chronic disease and system limitations.
The funding decision for the four-year period was made following consultations between the Government and the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
“The Government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific problems facing the state”, Ms. Plybersec said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for the plan campaign.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help to bridge the backlog.
There is also money for unrecorded clinics in Hobart and Lonesston to improve the quality of post-inpatient care, to train health professionals, to provide mental health services and to introduce personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will be based on ideas put forward by advanced doctors on how best to help Tasmania’s health system,” said Ms. Plybersec.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmania Government should work with strict accountability and responsibility.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the staff provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would solve nothing “unless they are followed by genuine reform that will make Tasmania's health system more sustainable”.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to bringing the state's health system out of its critical state,” Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures have largely compensated for recent reductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today’s statement is “a solution similar to a plastic band.”
“The reason we're here is because the Labor government threw up $430 million from the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
When the state government rips off nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can't pretend to be good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plybersec to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screening by Guillaume Niklu of Denis Didero's novel can boast of an exceptional production and historical detail, but it is also more difficult to perceive than it should have been.
The film, which is taking place in France in the 1760s, tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by her family.
When she starts to rebel, she's extremely violent at the hands of a sadist apostolic woman and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to dirty or sensational — and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the story runs the risk of becoming a trial for a hairy woman and an audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons, says the monitoring group.
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition, and an international monitoring group declared on Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group claimed that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the country's civil war almost three years ago.
Statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was issued one day before
The deadline of 1 November set by this organization based in The Hague for Damascus to destroy or render inoperable all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms for mixing chemicals with the delivery of poison gas and filling them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during the fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, where experts believe the chemical weapons production facility and storage sites are located, reports the British-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights.
A group of activists who monitored casualties through a network of activists in Syria claimed 120,296 deaths on Thursday.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government side, the group stated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bashar Al-Assad, 18,678 pro-Government fighters and 187 Lebanese fighters of Hezbollah.
Also among those killed, according to the statement, were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the United Nations estimate of 25 July, 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought in Safir for weeks against insurgents, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The battles highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the short duration of their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied that it has verified and seen destroyed all critical means of production and mixing/refilling equipment declared by Syria”.
It added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, as stated by the inspectors.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both locations were, according to Syria, “deresolved and ... chemical weapons programme items within them were moved to other designated locations that were verified”.
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the Safir site was one of two places that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in the most challenging mission this organization has ever undertaken,” said Ahmet Üzümcü, Director-General of the observation group, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For the third year now, the civil war has confronted insurgents, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad Government and its security forces, which are composed of members of its sect, the branches of Shia Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of the Rami Abdurrahman centre said that there had been a massive explosion on Wednesday at an anti-aircraft site in the coastal province of Syria, Ladhiqiyah.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over sentencing the organizers of the Bali attack
The survivors and relatives of 202 victims of the Bali bomb attack in 2002 reacted with anger to the last of the conspirators who had been tried and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who had spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the bomb attacks.
He may be released within 15 years if he receives parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person called a “subversive” for his reputation as a bomb maker should be sentenced to death.
This decision added to the painful memories of the mother of Perth June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in an attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
Barely holding back her tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I must live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was detonated in a parked van outside immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives only 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he went into a coma for a month and died three times, connected to a life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of three other members of the Jemaah Islamiya terrorist cell responsible for the massacre — Amrose, Muhlas and Imam Samudra — who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
Save his life, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last party to the Bali terrorist attack to stand trial.
He had been in hiding for almost 10 years, but was finally detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American troops killed former Al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence evidence indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
“He did not give up,” said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he did not regret how much grief he had caused other people.
The verdict is in anticipation of the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” said Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: " Air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but don't call from a mobile phone) "
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch films and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly this change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, said FAU administrator Michael Wert at a press conference.
Aviation companies will have to show FAA how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and installation rules to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among airlines that had already submitted plans.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” FAU said.
Passengers are now required to switch off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives the word “good”.
Passengers must switch off their devices again when the aircraft is down to land and do not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected against electronic interference can allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, stated FAH.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight attendants, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), this will be a win-win option,” Glading said.
We are frankly tired of being “school on duty” when it comes to this question.
But Internet connections for surfing, e-mails, text messages, or downloading of data will still be banned at less than 10,000 feet, reported by the agency.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no Words with Friends, an intelligent Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when a familiar case occurred: the actor was taken from an American Airlines aircraft for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was landing.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still have to be put in the luggage room, because they can hurt someone if they fly all over the cabin.
Mobile phone calls in flight will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls is vested in the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
The FAH may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Council, a national transport safety expert for CBS News, stated that cell phones were still considered a risk.
“ Cell phones are indeed a problem, not only because they have the potential to interfere with navigation devices, but we know, thanks to the FCS, that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air,” said Rosenker.
The industry advisory committee set up by FAU to study this issue recommended last month that the Government allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on FAHs to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as the Missouri Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill, argue that there is no compelling security reason for bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radios, high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAH as resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering the use of Wi-Fi at cruise heights for several years.
Fixed-wing aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted to the wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, said Wert.
Today’s electronic devices usually emit radio signals much lower than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when turning pages.
But the signals get stronger when the devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on passengers using electronic devices was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company downloaded an entire airliner with their electronic book readers Kindle and flew on it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAU advisory committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passengers Association stated that he considered interference with the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only isolated reports from pilots confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those reports were very old.
However, the committee recommended that FAH allow pilots to require passengers to switch off devices during boarding in reduced visibility.
A group of tourism industry representatives welcomed these changes, calling them a reasonable step towards the passengers, who are now using many technological devices.
“We are glad that FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Doe, Director General of the US Tourist Association.
Driving schools will be able to conduct driving tests
Driving licences will be available to private companies with their own computer-based motor vehicle.
This is written by Commersant with reference to the Government's draft Regulation “On the Admission to Driving”.
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such motorcades in Russia.
It is expected that students in such “privileged” auto schools will be counted for internal testing.
At the same time, the State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate will monitor the passing of examinations every six months.
If it is found that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical exams and more than 20 per cent of the area do not pass at the first time, such a school will be denied six months of privileges.
The technical requirements for motorbombs contained in the draft Government Regulation will come into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for driving instruction for two-wheeled machinery.
As of 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to take an urban test to obtain category A rights.
Furthermore, as of 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers would be required to obtain Russian rights after passing the examination.
A bird transported by air to a safe place from a drilling rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
A bird that was flown ashore after being found exhausted at an oil tower in the North Sea was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed in a helicopter heading for Aberdeen last month and then was released by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at the rescue centre in Alloya.
Centre manager Colin Seddon said, "This water shepherd is probably a winter migrant from Northern Europe who entered a strong wind zone over the North Sea."
Looks like the bird's exhausted and was able to find shelter at the oil rig.
He added: “She was unable to take off again, so we were approached for help.”
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is the elite of Europe willing to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to gather business representatives and to identify changes that the wealth and jobs creators of Britain want to see in their relations with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about Britain, business, and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a broad segment of business in the UK by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have learned that the vast majority of enterprises are now looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are upgrading and growing, while EU countries are stagnant.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries like China, India, and Brazil, rather than waste time on a long and difficult process of reforming the EU’s complicated institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from competition regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in Europe's trading zone — even 40 per cent of the large enterprises traditionally the most pro-European of all companies agreed.
Last and foremost, our survey of business leaders revealed that the clear majority wants Britain to move towards a trade-based, not policy-based, change of treaty and relations with the EU.
This result, which has been seen among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a “significant change” that will restore power back to Britain.
The stakes are high — achieving treaty changes and better conditions for Britain will provide a 16 per cent shift in voting to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to renegotiate British EU membership.
It also shows that business expects that revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back to the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to employment and economic growth in Britain, and as our survey shows, for business this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels’s regulatory work.
U.S. Secret Service is listening to the Pope's personal phone.
The Vatican is under the watchful control of American intelligence agencies.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that U.S. intelligence has been listening to all the conversations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now a close guardian of Pope Francis.
His phone began to be tapped before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of electing the new pope was also monitored.
What the U.S. attached special importance to.
The intelligence service has connected to the cardinals' cell phones, which have gathered in Rome to select another Pope.
The telephones of the residence where the members of the conclave lived were also tapped.
American spies have been listening to all the main candidates for the papal throne to prevent Washington's undesirable figure from appearing on it.
Panorama magazine writes that the U.S. big ear continued to intercept prelate conversations until the end of March 12.
In the United States, it is alleged that since 2005, Argentine Archbishop Bergolío has been designated as the future of the Pope.
American intelligence was also involved in negotiations for the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine reports that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives working at the United States Embassy continues to be involved in political and financial intelligence.
In turn, the Vatican has peacefully announced that he does not care about the American wiretap, even if it does.
Holy fathers have no secrets from the leadership of the United States.
The snowboarder for the Olympic bill was specially photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a commemorative banknote for the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The number of bills is 100 rubles.
But online bloggers are already actively ironic about the memorable note.
Following the presentation of the Olympic bill on 30 October, they noted that a picture of a snowboarder from a banknote could be found in photo banks.
In particular, in a free storeroom photo of StockExchange, where the photograph is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobsor on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in RugGear smartphone advertising.
The Olympic note is done in blue and blue.
On the one hand, we have a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other hand, a view of the Olympic Stadium and the Firebird.
The banknote was designed by Pavel Bushuev, who won a competition among students at the St. Petersburg Academy of Art, Repin.
The presentation noted that a number of sports - skiing, freestyle and ski jumping - were considered, but eventually snowboarded because it was a relatively young sport.
According to Izvestei, close to the Central Bank, the regulator is interested in public opinion regarding the widespread distribution of the image of the snowboarder on the Olympic note and is now studying the situation.
But in Gonjak, you're not too worried about the noise around the Olympic note.
The head of the State Press Service, Natalia Nikiforova, stated to Izvesdam that all arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the note will turn to the right, in the photos on the net to the left, she clarified Nikiforov.
The person in the photo shoot to create the bill was filmed from different points, then the final image was selected, on which was the characteristic position of the snowboarder.
It also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for work.
In the view of the experts, the discussion about the image in the Olympic bill is positive at all.
The recognizability of the image in the bill - plus its promotion - is considered by Alexei Popovichev, CEO of the RusBrand.
It is difficult to prove a 100 per cent resemblance of images in bills and in photo banks, so claims against intellectual property against the image are unlikely to be made.
The Olympic notes first appeared in China, with a commemorative note of 10 Yuan issued for the Beijing Games in 2008.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less beer.
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, beer consumption in the country will remain stable next year, at best.
Although business people initially expected growth.
After all, this year is not a good year for them: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
The head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, Isaac Sheps, Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers, reported on all of this at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute, “Procurements of everyday demand in Russia”, which just ended in Moscow.
It was about government regulation of the market.
Between 2008 and 2012, the Russian beer market had already declined by 18 per cent, as there had been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in recent years with regard to the production and circulation of beer - a drink with a small alcohol content - reported to Scheps.
There is no country in the world where the beer market is so severely restricted, the unpredictable introduction of new and illogical prohibitions that are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer complained that many of the legislative prohibitions designed to reduce alcohol abuse had little impact, yet new initiatives were constantly emerging.
This year’s ban on the sale of alcohol in kiosks was the most painful for beer producers.
"We immediately lost 35,000 consumers," said Isaac Sheps.
The brewers have two forecasts for next year.
Optimistic is the one Sheps was talking about: sales of foam beverage will stay the same.
Pessimistic - fall another two to three percent.
In order to preserve their profits, businessmen have to move away from consumer-oriented varieties to the “primium” class: beer will become smaller, but it will be more expensive.
However, the radical consequences of the fall in sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"In my observation, the level of alcoholism remains at about the same level, "Alexei Sotnikov, a drug doctor, reported.
True, there has been an increase in the proportion of patients who use surrogates of strong beverages, as well as those who have been “subdued” to alcohol-containing tonics such as the Jaguar, whereas, 10 years ago, it was beer alcohol that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford car factory in Vsvopozhsk.
According to the trade unions, all the laid-off were compensated.
However, the issue of reducing production in the region is much more acute than that of workers.
ZakSa Deputy Alexei Etmanov stated at the meeting that some 600 people had been reduced at the Ford factory in Vsevopozhsk.
According to him, this occurred as early as September, when about 600 people left the factory under a voluntary dismissal programme that was developed with the organization ' s union.
Workers who voluntarily decided to resign were offered “gold chutes” at the rate of several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority left their jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I think it's more than that.
However, the authorities did not plan to adopt any programmes in the next two years to support regional enterprises in difficult circumstances”, he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large job losses.
This information is not refuted or confirmed by Ford.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as he shows up, we're going to publish it.
Talk about cutting off workers at Forda's factory in Vsvovolozk has been going on for a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to fire 600 people had become known as early as September.
The plant had previously declared the production of vehicles suspended.
The factory cited the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia as a reason.
According to Petrostat, industrial production in Lenobast fell by 5.4 per cent in the nine months of 2013.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
The U.S. will be able to use mobiles during take-off and landing.
The new regulations for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing are approved in the United States and are reported by BBC.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and the new regulations will be in effect by the end of 2013.
However, Internet connections for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights of less than three kilometres.
Due to the danger of interference with the aircraft ' s radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be banned.
Thus, airline passengers will be allowed to read electronic books, play tablet games and other gadgets, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the regulations are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of electronic devices during flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobiles on aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to the source, as in the United States, it is also possible to review existing standards for the use of electronic devices in flights in Britain.
The Russian Mafia in the U.S. has a new name, "Brother Circle."
This week, the blacklist of "Russian Mafia" in America has added new names and four companies.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance introduced three Russians, two Uzbeks and an Israeli into the Bratsky Circle.
One of the Russians turned out to be a famous singer, Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspects was transporting money for members of the group.
A total of 22 members of the Bratsky Circle and six affiliated organizations are on the U.S. blacklist.
Nevertheless, many experts doubt that such an organization does exist.
The "Brother Circle Statement" is more like an attempt to unify fragmented criminal groups," said organized crime expert and New York University professor Mark Galeotti earlier.
In his view, the Brotherly Circle reflected a popular perception of the Russian mafia.
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization”, quotes Mr. Galeotti from the American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Professor George Mason Liz Shelley agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
"If they do act together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization," she quotes the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the Bratsky Circle unites the more close Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Ded Hassan.
Criminal authority was murdered in January this year.
For example, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zakhari Kalashov, who completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Deed Hassan, and another member, Temur Mirzoev, was a nephew.
He noted, however, that some individuals were not related to Usoyan.
In his view, they had all been united rather by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps, Russia's favorite singer, Vladimir Putin, into the Bratsky Circle has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to get more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, and that is why it was decided to put it on such lists,” said the spokesman for Head of State Dmitry Peskov.
In any event, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Like all citizens of the Russian Federation, their interests will be protected.
Head of Gazprom Alexey Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field.
The construction of the Southern Flow pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
“Today, a landmark event has taken place: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the Southern Flow pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” said Gazprom Chairman Alexey Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The southern flow is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains most of Russia’s European gas, increases the level of risk to conventional routes, says officials.
Miller stated that direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been removed “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the Southern Flow at a reduced price as soon as the entire project becomes operational in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should start in other countries further along the gas pipeline by the end of the year.
The pipeline has an annual design capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Sarat district, a Peugeot driver drove to an oncoming lane of 115 kilometres along the Odessa-Reni route and ran into a bus carrying six people.

Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences even before the charges against Jonathan Lord were brought to the attention of the Royal Commission.
Two YMCA NSW staff members were charged with sexual offences against children before charges were brought in 2011 against Jonathan Lord, a child care worker in Karingbach, who reported to the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But the commission’s opening statement stated that it “never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Officer, Philippe Hare, was asked about one case in which YMCA had been charged with child pornography offences and another in which a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbach Hall had been convicted of sexual offences against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Ferness, the lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.
He admitted that YMCA was also inaccurate in its opening speech to the Commission, claiming that “there were external audits of YMCA that recognized YMCA as the front line for child safety”.
The evidence presented to the Commission indicates that YMCA was notified that it received the second out of four possible quality audits conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed by hiring the Lord and failed to ensure that the staff had a clear understanding of their obligations regarding reporting violations of child security policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that YMCA corporate ethics prevented staff from reporting child safety violations of the Lord.
The staff testified that they had witnessed violations, including Lord being alone with the children, personally caring for them, putting them on his knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowing them to play with their mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under Lord's direction and asked to be trained to protect her children because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, the child custody manager of YMCA in Karingbach, who was Lord's head, "very frightening and often difficult to access".
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the staff members ' explanation that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord had led them away from the idea of reporting him.
Mr. Hare said that he had presented his opinion to the YMCA Council of New South Wales that the lesson for the organization from “the Jonathan Lord incident” did not refer to the provision of information by staff members, and the Board agreed with it.
Mr. Hare stated that the decision to force staff members to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges were filed was made by the Director General of YMCA for the custody of the children of Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent tampering with evidence, but that it was “exercised” and the decision was poorly implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not a child-friendly organization during Jonathan Lord’s work in New South Wales between 2009 and 2011, and the commission was briefed by Professor Stephen Smolbone of Griffith University.
He said that there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and monitoring staff.
The hearing is adjourned until 20 December.
São Paulo Fashion Week.
She's not just a model in the country, she's a real star.
Although Giselle Bundschen left the job for a while, distracted by motherhood, she came here on purpose these days and this week.
The months of absence did not prevent her from keeping her seat on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world's highest-paid supermodel.
This time, she was part of a Kolcchi defiling.
Fashion week endings are usually the most interesting shows.
Like what the stylist Lino Villaventura organized.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of the pret-a-port luxury class, the designer has been active in theatre and cinema, producing plays and costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies involved in the textile industry and the fashion world participated in the closing week of fashion in São Paulo.
It is one of the most dynamic industries, employing more than 2 million Brazilians, with an annual turnover of $50 billion.
Tony Blair said that he would take the chance of returning as British prime minister, but admits that return is unlikely.
The night before, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since his retirement in June 2007, after 10 years of leadership, Blair has largely avoided discussion of British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the four Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked if he would return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, he said, "Yes, of course, but I don't think that's going to happen, so..."
The coach-in-chief of Milana Massimiliano Allegrey expressed regret at the no-man's performance in Italy's 10th round with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failure at the start was due to a series of injuries to leading players.
I'm sorry we didn't win, but Tmw says Allegrey.
The team played a good match, creating three or four good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let Lazio do anything.
In the second, the Romans added, but in general, I can't say that we've lost concentration.
I had to win.
Last season, we met the challenge of winning the League of Champions.
Now we're behind schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Look at Kaka, who had a high-level meeting.
Connoiting experts who were moving to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy who had taken his first steps just a few months earlier, this little boy and his pet Shetland pony, Toffee, raced through three tours to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple — the same height — received high marks for their appearance, behaviour, and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnibank Mounting Centre in Radri, near Cardiff.
When he went out to see the men and women in the fine hats, he moved his hat and proudly spent two-year-old Toffy around.
The judges praised Fenton for his unparalleled innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffee got the highest grade for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffy on his third birthday last March, and since then, he's been studying with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffy make a beautiful duet."
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unknown people in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantigo, near Abb Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has shown horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, “The public was amazed and everyone shouted in favour and clapped”.
He ran through the sand along the length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did a fine job.
Fenton's crazy about animals -- he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
From the way he started, he will soon be participating in the Horse of the Year — and I am sure he will do well.
The representative of this annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The judges commended Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves in the show ring.
They assess the coherence of the pony and the maker, Fenton and Toffy, were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper “to be reorganized” published
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the front page a call for the release of the accused in the slander of a reporter, should be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The newspaper New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently confessed on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a State ownership interest.
Now, the New Express has to go through a process of total error correction, as the regulator reports.
An order for “correction of errors” came from the Guangdong Office in the areas of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that Yangcheng Evening News Group published several false reports on Zoomlion's listed company from September 2012 to August 2013.
“The New Express's editorial guide was misleading,” said the regulator's statement.
He states that it has been decided “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his reporter's licence”.
He also “directed Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a full correction to the New Express and recommended that it investigate the newspaper responsible for the situation and make immediate changes to the management of the New Express”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities in the construction equipment company Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published two appeals for his release on the front page, stating that she supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State television, admitting that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he said to the public broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confession, the New Express published an apology on the front page, stating that the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of extracting confessions in China is still widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to self-incrimination.
The United States - Mexico Tunnel was discovered for drug trafficking with its own railroad.
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation, and electric rail systems, has been found.
The U.S. authorities described this four-by-three-foot tunnel as one of the most difficult secret passages they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzags are nearly six football fields long, links warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is filled with low-profile warehouses, which facilitates the clandestine loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled, as the authorities claimed.
According to judicial documents, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine were seized by law enforcement when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officials, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage found in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after the cannabis harvest in October, which made it difficult for drug cartels to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found passages approximately 700 yards long, equipped with rail tracks that ranged from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
Pensions have been increasing in Belarus since November
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November this year, and reported to the Belta correspondent at the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection ' s Directorate-General for Pensions.
As of 1 November this year, the average wage of workers in the Republic applied in the previous pension recalculation will be adjusted, with an increase of 5.4 per cent, and the corresponding recalculation of labour pensions will be carried out in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on pension increases.
As a result of the recalculation from November, it is estimated that the retirement pension will increase by an average of 5.3 per cent.
The average old-age pension will be Br2 million.
An increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on increased pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month from November this year.
At the same time as labour pensions are recalculated in November this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements will be recalculated as the minimum subsistence budget increases per capita on average.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 47,000,530 - 2.1 per cent higher than the one in force from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the amounts of minimum labour pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and pension supplements will be increased by 2.1 per cent as of 1 November.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion-0-0 per cent of pensions were earmarked for increases in 2013
British police give Assanju notice of extradition
The British police today gave notice of the extradition of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London and sought asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian “official request to surrender” to appear at a police station, adding that if this requirement was not met, he would be further arrested.
Assanju faces extradition to Sweden for sexual offences after he has exhausted his powers under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he took refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, requesting political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland Yard “has given a 40-year-old man an official demand to surrender, which requires him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of his choice”, as the spokesman reported.
He continues to violate the terms of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the police notice.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible espionage charges, following the publication of over 250,000 American diplomatic dispatches on the anti-secret WikiLeaks website.
A driver driving 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs is fined £1000.
The motorist was fined £1000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
35-year-old Andrew Howie from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take out between his legs.
In the Court of Justice of Colchester Howie, he admitted the charge of driving without due diligence or attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driving licence resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howi was also ordered to pay £90 and an additional fee of £100 to assist victims of crime.
A tax on foreign real estate owners would make the London bubble burst.
Treasury had made a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but was awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a government tax of 7% on houses worth more than £2 million and an annual payment for buyers who decided to own houses in a partnership rather than as individuals.
To date, the State has paid a housing tax in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which was £708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook stated: “It is very difficult to argue that taxation of high-value real estate is undervalued, regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system, after the increase in the State tax burden on high-value houses and the related anti-evasive legislation”.
“But this move may result in some foreign investors being reluctant to buy property in London, or the current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class real estate – the top 5 to 10% of the housing market at cost – in the rich southwest belt of London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew by a record 11.8% in the past year.
According to a study by Savilles, prices in the centre of London continued to grow steadily at an annual rate of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by a strong “domestic market” with a spike in prices in the south-west, in the north (7.4%) and in the east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the dog’s tail moves are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs have a tail on the right side (from the dog’s point of view), while troubled dogs have a tail on the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can see and react to these subtle differences in tailing.
Professor Giorgio Wallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, says, "It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are involved in various ways in the formation of agents that generate positive or negative emotions.
Here we tried to look at it from other species as well.
He added that just as in humans, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the multidimensional twisting of the tails of other dogs, researchers watched animals as they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
We'll probably soon figure out why their tails sometimes go in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Wallortigara said, "We showed dogs a video of dogs -- either naturalistic or silhouette -- to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail more to the left or to the right."
When animals saw that otherwise the unexpressed dog moved its tail to the right (in terms of the tail of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning primarily to the left (again from the point of view of the tail of the dog), their heart rate was increasing and they looked anxious.
Professor Wallortigara said he didn't think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be concerned about or not.
He notes: “If there are several encounters with other dogs and often their tail is swayed by more friendly behaviour, and the right side is less friendly, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians, and trainers a better understanding of their animal’s emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at the Veterinary School of Bristol University, said that this was not the first study to test whether the left and right were relevant to dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a happy dog.
And in another academic paper by Victoria University in Canada, he said, "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was swirling to the left than to the right rather than to become alarmed, which is the opposite of Italian research."
He said that differences might be due to the fact that dogs in different studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes go in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys are postponing a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness.
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This chieffield band was supposed to perform at the town concert site of Hydro on Friday.
However, the illness of vocalist Alex Turner forced them to postpone the show.
The band's statement was made after she was forced to postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
The statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys, stated: "After the decision to move the show to Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking Arctic Monkeys' medical attention, the show is also scheduled to be postponed at the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February.
Pope Francis will build new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on 22 February, as announced by the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the selection of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal can no longer participate in the election of the pope — a prerogative of the group of 120 cardinals.
In announcing the news, Vatican spokesperson Father Federico Lombardi said that a meeting of all current cardinals, known as the constory, would be held before the San ceremony.
“Papa Francis decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the constory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from around the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February the number of cardinal electors is likely to decline.
He said that usually Dad names as many cardinals as he needs to bring the number of cardinals to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over 80 as he wishes.
The Constabulary next year will be important because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, according to Valero.
So far, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially in favour of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he noted.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a negligible number of cardinals.
They will also be the first cardinals selected since Francisco formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world charged with seeking ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad made his own decisions.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said that it was “perfectly possible” that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before — this is our first time.
Valero said that popes used to appoint cardinal bishops from the major parishes, but Francis “a pool of surprises — so we don't know who he's going to call.”
GM is calling off a number of new pickup trucks in the USA to refine seat backs
General Motors Co is calling off almost 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks of the 2014 model to address problems with manual seat back adjustment, in line with the Friday notification from U.S. traffic safety regulators.
For some of the pickup trucks, front seats may have a defect in the seat back inclination.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal vehicle safety standards on head restraints.
“In rear impact, the head restraint may not adequately protect the occupants by increasing the risk of injury” is stated in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website notification.
The withdrawal models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM pick-up began in June and is the most important start-up of the car in serial production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM reported a defect to pickup owners in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notification to the owners due to the 16-day suspension of the Government, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pick-up trucks, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM announced on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pick-up trucks and 16,503 Sierra pick-up trucks.
GM stock on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
Obama’s Voter’s Despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change.
He says that Obama allowed Republican obstruction to undo commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot be an excuse for problems with Obama’s reformed health-care website, drone attacks.
The 2008 Obama Memorial is a sad reminder of what might have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in a time of discouragement in my second year of medical school and restore me to a sense of hope.
It's called "Wrathy for Victory," and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients tonight and go to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people, and performances may have taken a breath.
The election victory was impressive, and leading news programmes paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates were crying out of joy, and my parents were saving every newspaper they could find.
A young team of strategists would come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Return to the present is a gross awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from passing a law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the lifting of the “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” rule of the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the choice of public health care and the closure of the Guantanamo base, among others.
But after countless times I have stood by the Obama administration to defend it before colleagues and peers, I have run out of explanations that I can provide.
I've reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain a permit to listen to foreign leaders or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the collection of data on American privacy by the National Security Agency or the pursuit of whistleblowers that expose government wrongdoing.
He cannot explain the extrajudicial killing of an American citizen, Anwar Al-Awlaki, or the non-compliance with State funding and spending limits during the presidential campaigns.
He could not justify the report's conclusions, which stated that the White House's efforts to silence the media were “the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration”.
More recently, it cannot justify failing to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on accessible health care.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have known at the age of 18 that leadership could run counter to the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is clear that elected office is not a predictable agenda for action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and random events such as the massacre in New Town.
Nevertheless, it is evident from all the examples I have listed above that they were to a large extent a choice of their own by the Administration.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and crude alternative, and he seemed unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I believed that Obama, in his second term, freeing himself from the pressures of future elections, would live up to the hopes we have heard of for so long.
However, when Obama’s rating dropped below 45% this week, it became much more difficult to return through this book in 2008.
It makes me long for a lot of promises that have gone.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes Clinton’s deafening defeat in Pennsylvania’s primary election.
At the failure analysis meeting, he told his staff that they must return to normal and remain committed to their goal.
“I want us to return our attractiveness,” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave.
Deputy billionaire Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining tycoon, who has a unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made this statement at a time when he was trying to get away from questions about whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding to eliminate carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters become pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they receive leave,” Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax constituency, with a majority of 53 votes after the recount.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the voting procedure to expedite the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be taken two months after we have voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system so we can come in, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
It seems strange to use a pencil these days.
The Electoral Commission was exploring electronic voting opportunities and had recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included the Sunshine Coast International Airport and that he would take his new job “very seriously”.
Public office involves public service.
“We seek no reward other than thanks to history for serving this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS removes two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders in its foreign exchange unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is further evidence that global scrutiny by regulators of alleged foreign exchange manipulation is gaining momentum.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS officers to be removed during an ongoing investigation that echoes the scandal of interbank manipulation of LIBOR.
By refusing to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulatory authorities this month.
“Our ongoing investigation of this matter is ongoing, and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank reported two weeks ago.
Last month, informed persons said that RBS had handed over e-mails and instant messages that had been received and sent by its former trader, the UK regulatory authority, the Financial Action Control Office (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave in his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of the European spot trading in Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from his job by the Stand Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's instant contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to knowledgeable individuals.
The UBS Bank reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said that he was investigating alleged currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antimonopoly agency Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers conspired to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, as indicated by familiar individuals.
Banks are looking at instant messages and e-mails over the years in search of cases of wrongdoing.
The news of the inspections has given rise to traders in activities that in recent years have been one of the largest sources of revenue for the trading units of investment banks, but this year has been difficult because of the low volatility of currencies, which reduces opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate a large and highly liquid currency market, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very small price.”
This news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of its London Stock Exchange traders this week after it had caused losses of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the issue was managed to be localized,” Credit Suisse reported.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama’s Health Care Act
The US Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama’s landmark health law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
In a 5 to 4 vote, the judges ruled that individual orders under the Patient Protection and Accessible Health Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the Government ' s tax authority.
The Chief Justice, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2700-page law and further held that the requirement of the Health Act that states improve their compliance with Medicaid, otherwise they would lose all federal funding of Medicaid, was not unconstitutionally coercive.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Businesses filed a motion to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
Football's a cause of discord?
In the State Duma, politicians and experts spoke on how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Some of the suggestions were to ban football in the North Caucasus, because it's a game of scandal and discord.
Speaker Sergei Narishkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that politicians and the media must be correct in their rhetoric to reduce the “degree of tension in society”.
He was probably referring to a recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in a television broadcast threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if he didn't want to limit birth...
All speakers referred also to measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and to measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which gave rise to confusion in the discussions.
Maxim Grigoriev stated that the events in Biryulev were “a model conflict that could have been predicted”, but “we have too many people and bodies to answer for these questions”, and seven nurses have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe had long practiced with regard to migrants had failed, in the opinion of society, and it was necessary to find its way.
Historian Yuri Petrov had high hopes for a new single history textbook.
“It is still necessary to create a manual on the history of the country's peoples' culture so that students in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa”, he said.
Gennady Zuganov proposed to criminalize "calls to dismember Russia": "If the U.S. radio says you have to give Alaska to Russia, you'll be arrested and given 20 years in jail!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to inflame.
As usual, he accused journalists of bringing sick and acute national problems to public debate: “In the heat of controversy, nothing can be said.”
The leader of the One Russia faction, Vladimir Vasiliev, immediately advised journalists to conclude a “chart” and agree to talk on the subject carefully, and then the same commitments can be made by politicians.
We have about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the whole order has been established, Mr. Vasiliev said.
As an example, he cited a law that held regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-ethnic peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andríchenko did not share the enthusiasm for the law: it does not “clearly understand what it is to adapt migrants, its mechanisms and its limits.
So the actors will interpret the scope of these powers differently.
Moreover, municipalities do not have the resources to deal with such complex issues, nor do they have the resources to use the guidance they need, and the centre does not provide them ...
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliyev, proposed the establishment of a special agency with the formidable name “Ministry of National Security” to deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who led a similar agency in the 1990s and was later abolished, opposed.
It's enough to have a special person at the federal level, a “minister without a briefcase”, to whom you can turn if you want.
“We are walking on the edge, the shells are tearing apart, it is very important for members of different ethnicities and religions to stand up together against provocations, and this work should be well-informed,” said the representative of the RPC for the Vsevolod Chaplin Society.
There should be no neutrality of the State with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, in his view.
There Oleg Nilov led the discussion into an unexpected course: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, we have to look for them, but they're being pushed on the wrong path, the wrong path," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The footballer is beaten up by a crowd, the flags are burned, the comrades are throwing stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another sport called rugby...
"There will be no equals for them in this sport in the world!" said the law enforcement man.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus!
You're gonna offer them a Curling!
You need to know the specifics of the country, it's like asking the Georgian "The Zaporizhian" to...
In Yaroslav, representatives of the Moscow club - during a game with a local club - distinguished themselves at the podiums.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the Russian Federation's supervisory and disciplinary committee, Arthur Grigoriantz, reported that the Cuban was fined 500,000 roubles, and that Philip PAPENKOV, a correspondent for the SE, was transferred from the Football House.
Such sanctions were imposed on the Krasnodar club for setting fire to the flag of Dagestan by fans at the rostrum during a home game against Anji on the 14th.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the RPFL.
We've been looking at all the materials we have.
A fine of 500,000 roubles has been fined for the improper behaviour of Cuban viewers.
Google, Samsung, Huawei patent claims filed against Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, whose price it interrupted at the Northel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion in Northel patents, filed patent infringement claims with the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson, and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match key words on the Internet with their corresponding advertising, as stated in the claim, which is the basis of Google's search business.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones operating on the Android operating system of Google, which competes fiercely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
Google offered an initial $900 million price for Northel patents in 2011.
Google raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering a full $4.4 billion.
After losing the Northel Patents case to the Rockstar Consortium, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, part of this deal was the Motorola Patent Library.
“Despite a failed attempt to auction the patent that is the subject of the claim, Google has violated and continues to violate it,” says the lawsuit.
Rockstar claims increased damages from Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, as required by the claim.
Egypt is sworn in by the first freely elected President
Muhammad Morsi takes the oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIC Mohamed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he took the oath, becoming the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges in black robes in a court building on the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We want a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on State television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” Morsi said, a 60-year-old engineer with an American entity from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of the 84 years of its existence has been a banned organization that has been targeted by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the Mubarak-era presidential pomp, the movement was stopped only for a short time to allow his convoy to pass on the normally busy road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi was ridiculed as a non-charismatic “reserve wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige has grown dramatically since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists but also for all those who want to see the 2011 rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak through.
“Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi said, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wooden panels of the hall, where he took an oath.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that performed the national anthem, during which he stood at the table “quite”.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was greeted with the slogan “Army and People One Hand”, which chanted hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
Founded in 1908 as a pillar of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year began, and promised to return the powers of the President, whose office had been disenfranchised by a military council that accepted cases from a deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take a formal oath before the court and not before Parliament, as is customary, he does the will of the military, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
A further meeting of the Tyumen Association of Machine Builders was held at the Yalutor Motor Vehicle Plant.
As part of the event, a new line was launched for the production of steel welded pipes.
According to the business director Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the steel market in Tumen oblast was carried out in 2011 with the arrival of a new owner.
The region has been found to consume more than 50,000 tons of electric welded pipes per month.
It was then decided to change the profile of the plant and to install equipment for its production.
This year, more than 7,000 tons of manufactured goods have been shipped.
Investment in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles,” Dennis Gribanov told.
A new station was launched in October, allowing for a wider range.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for the thermal, small-scale construction and furniture industries, and a large profile for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50,000 tons of products per year, representing about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tümensk region.
Despite the shift to another activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - it now stands at 157 - and in the plans to purchase new equipment, an increase of more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is re-training its personnel, and the necessary specialists are drawn from the existing ones.
A new longitudinal steel cutting machine is planned for next year, with a thickness of up to five millimetres, which will reduce the cost of the product, as well as another machine, with a pipe production rate of up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is about to learn how to produce pipes that are used in housing and utilities.
The aim of the management is to cover up to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tiumen region in this area.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, advised that more attention should be paid to the modernization of the engineering industry.
This is also the case for State support to industry, which includes reimbursement of interest rates on loans for new equipment and leasing costs.
This year, 150 million roubles have been earmarked for this purpose, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The latter commission, which will review subsidy contracts, accepts documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the cost of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the coming year, the budget provided for 150 million roubles, which could be used to compensate for leasing fees and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million for energy conservation programmes.
The amount of 72 million roubles is being reduced to refunds for the equipment ordered and paid for, which is being produced in the southern region of Tumensk for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, this form of support will eventually cease because the reason for its introduction was to compensate for the mining tax paid by oil companies to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies are becoming direct spending obligations for the region.
With this in mind, the Government of the region has given priority to direct support to industrial enterprises rather than to financing through them the oil sector.
The budget assistance will relate to investment projects to be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the emerging oil situation.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage of the industry in the southern region of Tyumen, and if it is eliminated, it will be difficult to compete at the price of the middle strip of Russia, where the labour force is cheaper.
Furthermore, the question of the continuity of the new owner of TNC-IB, Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders in the Tumen enterprises, is unclear.
The Uvat Project Agreement expires in 2013 and no request for extension has been received.
At present, the Southern Region enterprises that specialize in oil and gas equipment cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes on the oil produced in the Uvat region will be paid to the region or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the deposits.
Tomič will work 240 hours for an extremist social media commercial.
The Lenin District Court of Tomsk sentenced a resident of the city to 240 hours of compulsory work, who posted an extremist video on the social network, to inform RIA News on Friday a representative of the press service of the Regional Court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his popular social media page, which is on the federal list of extremist material.
Criminal proceedings were instituted against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation entitled “Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity and at humiliating the dignity of a person committed in public”.
“The Lenin District Court dealt with the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime by imposing a penalty of 240 hours' mandatory work”, said the agency's interviewee.
She added that the man had fully confessed his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians the collapse of commodity prices after signing an association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that prices in the country will fall significantly once the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He stated this in his Facebook contact with his readers.
I can certainly say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs charges.
Thus, with the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area provision, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices would have to go down.
“This is about goods coming from EU countries,” Azarov wrote.
For other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, but will be indirect.
But there should be no price increases, either.
So the messages on the billboards, which have come up quite a lot in our country recently, that an association with the EU is a price increase, that's not quite true, or, more precisely, that's not at all, summarized Azarov.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Bisk
On 29 October, the media published a report that a kindergarten teacher in Biiska had locked a child in a basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are currently investigating all the circumstances, as well as providing a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten staff.
After Yevgeny Vasilyev was accused of malfeasance, she spoke
Eugenia Vasiliev, who has been the subject of close media attention for almost a year, has never, to date, commented on numerous press publications on both thefts at the Ministry of Defence and on her personal relations with the former Minister of Defence, Anatoli Serdyukov, her poetry and her addiction to valuable things.
However, on 1 November, the person in the Oboronservice case broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said, "Of course, the task was exactly the same: to extract any negative information from me about the former Minister of Defence."
There was blackmail for me to testify, or I'm going to jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, prove our innocence.
We're 100% sure of winning.
It may be concluded from the interview that Vasiliev was most likely struck by the words that she did not have a good taste.
This is probably a statement by Vladimir Markin, an official of the United Kingdom of the Russian Federation, that a collection of paintings collected by the person in the Oboron Service case revealed forgery.
Among the property seized is a number of paintings that the master, confident of her deep knowledge of art, has acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art research commissioned by the investigators following the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and were simply cheap counterfeits”, Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they admitted they weren't stolen from the DOD, and they said I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss any personal moments?
I think it's a mess," Vasilyeva says.
However, to the question of whether she admits guilt in any of the 12 criminal incidents she claims, Vasilyeva stated: “No, of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
Moreover, in response to today's statement by the SC of the Russian Federation that Vasiliev was avoiding the examination of the criminal case file, counsel for the person concerned stated that he and his client “did not allow the investigator to familiarize himself with the case file”.
What led to the revelation of Vasilyeva, who was under house arrest and still had no contact with the press?
Perhaps as a woman, she couldn't refuse to answer the charge of bad taste?
Or is it true that Komsomolka journalists claimed a couple of days ago that she was "in an even bigger trance under house arrest" because of news of the reconciliation between Anatoli Serdyukov and his wife and his return to the family?
Victor Baranets, a well-known military columnist for the KP, wrote in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?", "Students do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more talkative during interrogations."
Previously, Vasiliev had made some allegations of illegal sale of immovable property by the Department of Defense.
Predictable trouble.
What to do in the garden before freezing
From the fungicides in the fall, it is better to select copper-containing drugs, such as 1% Bordeaux mixture or Abiga-Pick, Oxihom, Ordan et al.
Do you think travel agents went back in time because of the Internet?
There seems to be a reverse trend in Flight Centre.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and is expecting record income from recreational workers in Australia and Great Britain.
This tourist firm now expects its main full annual profit before taxation to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with the previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are met, this would represent a 12 to 17 per cent increase over the record $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said that Flight Centre earned 8 per cent of profits in the first half of the year and began the second half with good performance, especially on weekly trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have record high returns in the full year, before deducting interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually our largest profits.”
In Australia, leisure businesses recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business was good, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States compensated for losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year, and expected to earn a profit for the third full year in a row.
Last night, Flight Centre stock grew by three cents to $38.20.
On October 31, the Barnaul police discovered two playrooms.
The first one worked in the Industrial District on Flying Street.
At the time of the inspection, there was a game at the place.
The club counted 24 vending machines.
Another game club was found in Leninsk district on Anton Petrova Street.
There were 20 arcade machines used here.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been prepared on the article “Illegal organization and gambling”.
The tech's been taken.
In the near future, the case files will be sent to the courts in the industrial and Lenin districts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who has brutally murdered two sisters.
Their bodies were burned after the murder.
According to the Press Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Sverdlovsk province, the previous day, in the Kirovsk district of Ural capital, after the fire had been extinguished in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Uralski Street, two women were found dead with signs of violent death.
The names of the dead were soon identified.
It turns out that they are sisters, one of whom is a 44-year-old resident of Catherineburg, the other is a 33-year-old resident of Orenburg oblast.
They rented a burnt flat a few days ago.
His investigation was under the personal control of the chief police officer of the Mikhail Borodin region.
The internal affairs agencies are working on various versions of the murder, verifying the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
It also establishes the purpose for which the women rented the apartment and where they had lived before, what they had done and with whom they had maintained relations.
Schools were encouraged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature since 1914.
The examination will also include “out-of-programme texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
A joint course in English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate final language examination, with persistent recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is due to produce new curricula tomorrow in English and mathematics, the first subjects to be radically revised.
It will make changes to other substantive items next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of examinations, OFQUIAL, will present a revised structure of secondary school final examinations, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Gove, said that there was “a broad consensus that we must reform our examination system in order to restore public confidence,” insisting that school graduation tests would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent.”
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours per year, while in Singapore students spend about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that large-scale school mathematics final exams, combined with an increased rate in the rating table, are likely to encourage schools to provide additional training in this subject.
In the curriculum, more emphasis will be placed on “real life goals”, including financial mathematics.
Tickets in Hayhae will cost the tourists 2,200 rubles.
As of tomorrow, from Enlightenment in Hayhae, tourists will be taking ships on a pillow.
For those who want to go to China, that means extra costs.
The puma ticket has traditionally been much more expensive than the boat.
According to Amurasso's help desk, the normal ticket cost would be 2,200 roubles.
Traveling through a high-comfort hall would cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, tickets did not cost much this season: at the same price, the pumas carried tourists last spring and a year ago in the autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rate of the Russian Federation is not sufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that the Russian Federation’s GDP growth rate is insufficient and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business credit and changing the structure of the Russian economy to innovation, reports Reuters.
We've been planning GDP growth this year at around 3%, maybe even a little more.
It's actually going to be a little less than 2%.
In the face of recession in a number of countries in Europe, it seems not to be bad, but it is not good for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries and, in general, it must be faster to develop.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses, receive normal credit at normal prices – the first thing that must be done,” the head of government stressed.

Travel through mud, rivers and the jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend receiving hundreds of patients.
There aren't many doctors in this West African country, just one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main characters of the 2013 CNN.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main heroes to become the CNN hero of the year.
This man will get $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwell saw his father return to life and return to unconsciousness, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that resembled itself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Georges Bwelle said.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwell accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they might have received.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle said.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., run to the hospital to be first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor per 5,000 population.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of health spending in the country is private.
“The only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
- And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives."
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded a non-profit organization, ASCOVIME, which arranges weekend trips to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people are forced into vans, tied to the roofs by medical supplies and travelling across the border to visit villages in need of assistance.
They don't always get lucky.
They've had to push cars across rivers and mud many times.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as true heroes — a celebration of songs and dances and the best facilities the locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bwelle, with his broad smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the crew starts receiving hundreds of patients.
“We accept 500 people on every trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from the entire neighborhood within a radius of 60 kilometres of the village, and they walk.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the crew conducts simple operations under local anaesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school, municipality or house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-op area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to light the operational and sanitary treatment of equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's too fast, but the team's commitment usually helps support the village musicians.
“They hit drums all night to keep us awake and working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the crew members go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that his free hernia treatment surgery would allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these weekend clinical treatments and working at the hospital by a surgeon, Bwell also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
This second job, he said, provided 60 per cent of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest was covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in Bwell's band.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to make money for the organization to keep these campaigns going.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in his tasks, this is an opportunity that they would never get at home.
“We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold instruments for Dr. Bwell,” O'Malley said.
As a sophomore student, you would never get that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, Bwell pays for their food, transportation and training.
"He's a hero, no doubt," O'Malley said.
He gave his life to that organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon was endless.
For Bwell, an almost constant workload is not a heavy test.
Helping others to live a happy life, keeping their father’s promise, is what makes him happy.
“I am so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle said.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's wiretaps.
A member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the interview, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German Attorney General's Office in a case involving a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor's phone by the US Special Prosecutor's Office.
Snowden has expressed his willingness to give the necessary evidence.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear,' said Hans-Christian Strebele, that he knew a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined.
Meanwhile, American legislators are beginning to respond to the scandal surrounding US spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill yesterday imposing additional restrictions on the United States electronic intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Mackay, told the journalists at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, and is informed by the correspondent for BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the public administration of the two countries will provide universal cooperation and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves,” noted Vladimir Mackay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions and extend maximum cooperation to that end.
The Minister also reported that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, leading to the signing of a protocol.
The parties have drawn up a road map for Belarusian-Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy agency, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture and energy, as well as seeking new forms and modalities of cooperation.
“The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey regard each other as reliable partners”, he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, in turn, reported that in the negotiations held, the heads of foreign policy departments of the two countries had decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
According to the Minister, trade between Belarus and Turkey should be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey was also an important partner in investment cooperation, which should be further developed, as there was an untapped potential in that area, he believed.
Relations between our countries have always been very warm, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
It will also create all the necessary conditions for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” noted Ahmet Davutoğlu.
Obama is renouncing his words about health care
In the storm of criticism, President Obama reneged yesterday on his often repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are being notified by their providers of services, the Republicans in recent days have criticized the President for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama altered his original public promise a little bit.
“Most people with health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in his Boston address.
With regard to what he called “news rejuvenation” over the cessation of services, Obama called on the receiving Americans to look for other market options.
Most people will be able to obtain better, integrated health insurance schemes at the same cost or even cheaper than predicted.
“You'll get better terms,” he said.
The Administration stated that it should not surprise anyone that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because they do not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Health Care Act.
“Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better,” Sibelius said in a statement to the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable health care, said that the launch of the online sales site had been “abominably bad” since October.
“I’m as upset and angry as everyone else,” she said.
- I really want your trust back."
Angry Sibelius dropped this phrase, which was picked up by a microphone behind her by an assistant sitting in yesterday's chamber after a heated debate with House Member Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, about whether she herself was obliged to join Obama's health program.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Siebelius to state why the “architist” of the Affordable Health Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance for the purchase of a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she was now imposing on millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt Agency has withdrawn media status for uncensored fighting.
On October 31, Mosgaard decided to invalidate Rosbalt's registration licence, writes Lenta.
Roscomnadzor insisted on removing the agency ' s media status, for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
In the course of the trial, an unpleasant precedent was set: the court considered it possible to close down the media, effectively denying the publication the right to raise counter-arguments.
What's Rosbalt?
The ROS Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was among the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
Rosbalt, however, has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications has been (and still is) the subject of notes referring to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the security forces have continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
In addition to Rosbalt's extensive source base in various departments, it was suggested that Natalia Chaplina, Victor Cherkesov's wife, was the head of the project.
However, Chaplin's role in the management of Rosbalt is unclear: it is most often referred to as the “project manager”.
Larissa Afonin is the director-general of the agency, and Nikolai Ulyanov is the editor-in-chief.
In recent times, Rosbalt has not been featured in federal media ratings, neither by quote nor by audience.
In October, the agency was ranked 25th on the LiveInternet website of Russia.
According to LiveInternet, the average daily audience of Rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (up to 500,000 views), and the monthly audience is about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are notes on the Kremlin's powerlessness with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the King and the Fool, and the pogroms in the city of Buryulev.
Rosbalta's conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law came into force to prohibit journalists from engaging in abusive fighting.
The agency found a banned phrase in two videos published on the agency's website ("Gigit of Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot defiled oil towers").
The other parties are described in different ways.
Roskomnadzor accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law on the basis of video footage and requested the court to withdraw the agency's licence.
Rosbalt stated that the agency's claims were not valid: first, the videos were not editorial material, second, the mother's words were disguised, and third, the videos were removed from the site immediately after warning.
The agency appealed Roskomnadzor ' s claims to the Peace Court - and when Moshorsud accepted Roskomnadzor ' s claim on 22 October 2013, the complaints were still pending.
However, on the 25th of the year, the justice of the peace had ruled against Rosbalt: editor-in-chief Nikolay Ulyanov had been found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and had been fined 20,000 roubles, 10,000 each.
Obviously, this prejudged the outcome of the Moshorsud hearing - if you give up the idea that the outcome might have been prejudged earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate the Rosbalta registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It is not possible to say that Rosbalt was left alone during this confrontation.
The Agency was supported by members of the State Duma (the application to the head of Roskomnadzor was signed by 26 deputies on 10 October; the document was submitted at the initiative of CRC).
The President of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Vsevolod Bogdanov, Pavel Gusev, President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, and Mikhail Fedotov, President of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, claimed that the publication had been illegal.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, Roskomnadzor’s leadership even gave him some assurance that it would not come to an end before the licence was revoked.
The Rosbalt trial showed that under whose jurisdiction the media in Russia is safer today is a big issue.
Syria destroyed chemical weapons equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities and has recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament has been completed by Damascus on the day before the deadline.
Prior to 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare chemical warfare agents for use, transferring the BBC.
The destruction of the stockpiles themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the OPCW representative, the poisons are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and munitions.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to ensure that they are not repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: by that time, OPCW and Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of poisons.
There's a lot of questions.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian declarations will be scrutinized by the Western intelligence services.
They will readily advise the inspectors on new sites for verification if there is reason to suspect that Damascus is not fully candid.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community required the Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement reached through Russia, to destroy or render inoperable all the capacity to produce shells, poison gases and liquids and to fill the shells with these substances.
Now that this phase has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already in the Syrian army.
It is assumed that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, dermal gas and other banned chemicals stored in dozens of different locations.
Its destruction requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities start by agreeing on a timetable — two weeks to do so.
The OPCW Field Operations Manager, Jerry Smith, told the BBC that his inspectors “took personal notice of the destruction of the equipment”.
“They no longer have the capacity to further manufacture or mix chemical weapons”, he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found that the projectile and poison plants were either destroyed or rendered inoperable.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to be inspected there, as stated in the document, but the equipment was transported and verified by OPCW experts.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical weapons infrastructure was “especially difficult” because of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but according to Smith, the inspectors had not yet had time to celebrate; they were too busy working.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that US espionage "has gone wrong"
John Kerry demonstrated a relaxation of the defense tactics of U.S. surveillance programs by making an unprecedented admission that in some cases US espionage "has gone wrong.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being “on autopilot” when Edward Snowden was exposed to the NSA’s espionage activities.
These leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said, “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken some of the things that are happening on autopilot, because this opportunity already existed — during both the Second World War and the very difficult years of the cold war, and of course 11 September”.
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that US espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone wrong.
The President is determined to shed light on the matter and to explain himself to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one feels abused.
I assure you that there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted with good intentions and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, detonate people and attack Governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashing, building bombing, and killing people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, American legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US espionage abroad and convince Europeans to continue their joint anti-terrorist efforts with the US, said the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs on Thursday.
The senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had spoken with members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It is indeed important for US national security that Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorist efforts,” said Democrat Murphy, first-time president of the Senate’s subcommittee of international affairs on European affairs, in an interview from Washington.
“And I'm going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.”
The news that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some US allies, although the agency’s head this week said that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations included documents released by Snowden indicating that the NSA monitored the German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone, as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper protected allied espionage as necessary and said it was a routine case on both sides.
Against that background, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit of Congressmen, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
He said that the programme of the visit was still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the visit was to help improve relations, he said that some degree of “best-intentioned hardness” would also be demonstrated.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their people about what spy programs they themselves have used for many years.
“While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should be on his way this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address issues of hostility to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US intelligence activities.
The influence of prison guards will increase in the new composition of the public monitoring commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (CSC) can approve new compositions of the Public Observation Commissions (CSCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the lobbyists will increase their influence.
ONCs are the social structures responsible for monitoring conditions in places of detention.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Rassizhev, the unrest in the Cope colony - it is through the ONC that most of the high-profile incidents are reported behind bars.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and silo lobbyists for control of the ONC.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of ONCs, I proposed that human rights experience should be the criterion for selection.
"It was not accepted, and the lists were formed without establishing criteria," explains Valery Borschchev.
Borschev is the current Chairman of the Moscow Supervisory Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, a nationwide structure of human rights defenders working on prison issues.
As a member of the State Duma from the Apple, he drafted a law regulating the activities of the ONC.
The OP Council should vote in favour of the composition of ONCs in 43 regions of the country.
Fewer than 1,000 applicants apply for 1,800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Cabardino-Balcaria competitions were not organized owing to a lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize pre-recruitment for vacant seats.
The Moscow NQC is one of the few competition commissions, even though the new membership will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borschov, in the current composition of the Metropolitan Commission, 11 human rights defenders and 9 silos, while in the OC ballot, the ratio is 17 to 23.
Thirty human rights defenders wanted to join the Metropolitan Commission.
At the same time, Vyacheslav Kalinin, a member of the “Friendly Brotherhood”, may be re-elected.
He had been a member of the CBO for three years, but had never visited a prisoner.
Borschov believes that by appointing its president, the Silos will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of the silos is coordinated by Anton Cvetkov, a member of the ONC, who heads the “Russian Officers”, an organization that defends the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies in a trek," said the BBC Daily Anton Flowers.
He denied lobbying for any lists and said he did not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Tsvetkov, he didn't even care what list they're voting for.
He considers the disclosure of Borschov's information a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chilean ONC.
Her former leaders will be suspended because of last year's Copenhagen riots.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission had ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But ONC Rostov-on-Donu can move from human rights defenders to silos.
On the new lists, a human rights activist chairing a local commission, turned out to be one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber ruled him out for unethical behaviour.
The lists of the Borschov Moscow and Rostow Commissions consider the “Kopeisk estate”.
The revelation of hope by Tolokonnikova did not affect Mordova's NKK, which is considered to be “strong”: only one human rights defender wanted to join the new force, and she did not even have the documents for the competition.
Board member Nikolai Swanidze told the BKK Daily that he had voted against the proposed list because he resented the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague, Pavel Gusev, says he voted in favour because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Co-ordinated the compilation of the JNC lists by Vladislav Grib, Deputy Secretary of OP, who is also a staff member of the FSI Research Institute.
Mushroom told RBC Daily that he did not believe it was right to divide candidates for human rights defenders and silos and did not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient authority to obstruct the work of its members.
The fungus is not supposed to predict the outcome of the vote of the OP board.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in a prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on 15 June by the Phuket Provincial Court of filing a false complaint following a report by Thai police that a local taxi driver had attacked on the night of Sunday, 10 June, while two other men held her.
However, surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
Prior to the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in a general-regime detention centre on the outskirts of Phuketa, not in a women's adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who sought help from the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was “extremely concerned” about their daughter’s well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“It is clear that this was an alarming time, but we hope that she will return home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on vacation in the Kraby resort area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could result in the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve her sentence in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to recover its damaged tourist image, leading to acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris for the presentation of his novel "Yeltysheva", translated into French.
Let's just remind you, this is his novel that's the finalist of the four prizes: "Standard Field", "Russian Booker", "National Best Seller" and "Big Book".
Last year, a writer for the book was awarded a cultural prize by the Government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Senchin is an undisputed leader of the current generation of thirty-year-olds and forty-year-olds.
Virtually every publication of its hard-core, modern - day stories and stories is a source of heated debate among critics of a wide variety of backgrounds.
It can be argued that the collection of articles on prose and publicics of Senchin, reviews of his books and magazine publications have created a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the early 2010s.
In the debate about the works of “one of the most controversial modern writers”, according to critic Sergei Chuprinine, much of the talk is about what the participants mean by “literacy” as seen not only in the present and future of our words but also in life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for the inclusion of most articles and reviews from the regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are generally given in the abbreviations under “Absassants”
