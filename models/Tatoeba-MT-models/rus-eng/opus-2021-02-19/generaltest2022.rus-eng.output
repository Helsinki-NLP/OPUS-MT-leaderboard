In my view, the literature program was formed by the Balzak-age ladies on the basis of their interests.
From 19th - century Russian literature, we preferred Danilewski and Volkonsky.
They wrote belletrics, of course, from the point of view of those same gals of Balzac age.
And the psychology and the torment of the heroes of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not as interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
The Micropacket Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.
In the mattress, the stiffness of the sides varies: the mid-rigid surface is formed by latexed coconut fibre and natural latex, and is moderately soft — a plate of natural latex.
A spring block with 1,000 springs per square metre adapts quickly to the body of the sleeper, warning the onset of wave or gamack effects.
One of the strengths of the model is to select breathing materials.
The latex, perforated for air-tightness, is highly ventilated naturally, as is the coir of the coconut.
As a result, a healthy microclimate of sleeping space is maintained.
The mattress is also subject to an extended guarantee period.
The official guarantee from the manufacturer is five years, and in fact the mattress is longer.
The protection against dust and pollution is provided by a removable jacket made of giccard, which is supplied as a package.
Get an orthopaedic pillow paired with the mattress – it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler defines the destination of the sides – coconut provides anatomical back support, latex relaxes the muscles.

I remember with horror these halls and guests at my parents' house.
The guests are on the doorstep, and on the stove, they're still burning, and my mom's shaking up the floor.
Oh, my God, I've been sitting at the table.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.

What about the guests?
They're fine, and they're sure to have a cake.
I don't like holidays anymore, guests.

Germany: Fourth inoculation against the coronavirus is imminent
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany would not be final, but would continue with renewed force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
This is reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11th.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in autumn," the expert says.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccine can be combined with influenza vaccine.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccinations can help to combat the spread of the new strain of the Omicron Coronavirus.
And the new option is particularly dangerous.
For example, Omicron is three times more likely to recontaminate than Delta or Beta strains.
A preliminary study conducted in South Africa shows this.
On this basis, BioNtech / Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omicron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against contamination with the new version of the Omicron Coravirus.
BioNtech and Pfizer showed that at two doses the efficiency is significantly lower: “neutralizing capacity is reduced by more than 25 times”.
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against Omicron Stamma contamination”, BioNtech and Pfizer stressed.
So a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, Salzberger believes that accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the distribution of both the delta virus and the coronavirus omicron.
“The experience of Israel is very convincing,” the expert stressed.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54mm, 8.5g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other wibs in that it was originally designed to be used for ice fishing, not just for capture fishing.
These Vibes have a larger weight than those of the closest analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive impact on the nuances of using these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin of hard and sturdy plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration with vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a winter vib in the fall of Bet-A-Vib, he shows a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is simple monotonous animation, i.e. movement up and down is almost without pause.
In planning a vertical axis, the deviation is not very large, which is convenient for fishing in a limited space, trapped by underwater vegetation, stumps and other obstacles that can be traced.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant to the capture of winter sudka and large bass, especially in the middle of winter, when point and aggressive baiting is required.
When it reaches the extreme point of the trajectory, the Bet-A-Vib rotates instantly and returns to the reference vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter trout fishing.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or no noise capsule (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib, by playing the ostrich, can irritate a passive pike that does not even react to a live animal.
In capture, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, well coupled with leek and weave cords, even large diameters.
For fishing, the pike, sudka, yersha or perch is, apart from the uniform, relevant, and the step, sometimes with the "twisting" down the bottom.
If you're caught in busy places, you can change the front triplet into a double, which will reduce the probability of hooks.
Among the baits of their Bet-A-Vib class, they are among the most resilient in their work and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used equally in relatively small and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Outer ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries have been reported
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries in Libya from the private military company Wagner.
The President of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled Al-Mishri, declared this on Sunday, 12 December.
“There are currently more than 7,000 PMV Wagner mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabiya Airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) " , quoted Anadolu.
Khaled Al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries were “trying to seize” the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after “bringing their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Save presence
According to a newspaper interviewee, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “deployed in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufre, is noted in the agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the ACV "Wagner" enjoys the Kremlin's support.
Where else are the mercenaries?
According to the Agency, Wagner is believed to be active in nine countries in Africa - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of arms, technology and military services to these countries,” states the article.
According to the media, the “vagners” allegedly fought in Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not listed in the security forces or the legal registry, and its fighters are not on the personnel manifest.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Let's remind you, the EU's 27 post-breeds had previously approved a retrenchment against Wagner.
The decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Libyan Supreme Council de facto is the second House of Parliament with advisory functions with the dominant Islamists, written by TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting for the election of members of Parliament and the Head of State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
“Before the election, there is less than two weeks left, and the chances that they will pass on time are rapidly declining”, notes the material.
Against this background, the Libyan Supreme Electoral Commission has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, broadcasting Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy with the eyes of Russians
38 per cent of Russians see more success than failure in their foreign policy, and 29 per cent believe that failure prevails.
"Examples of success -- "Syria protected, restored peace there," "Northstream 2 decision," "the world was intimidated by the cool weapons," "Crime we pulled."
The main failures - “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “insulation from the world” - are stated in the “Public Opinion” Foundation study.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned the paperwork - all public services have become digital, too.
The Government of Dubai reported a complete abandonment of paperwork and a shift to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
“Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life – we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government”, declared the Crown Prince of the Emirate, President of the Dubai Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktum on Saturday.
The internal and external processing of documents in all public institutions in Dubai will now be done only in digital form through dedicated information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health, HAC, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial entities have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization began in Dubai in 2018.
Since then, the authorities have estimated that 336 million paper sheets have been saved, representing 14 million hours of human labour and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, stated earlier that e-services save citizens two days a year.

Turkey ' s car production and export fell below 2020 levels
The production and export of Turkish cars fell sharply in November, against the backdrop of the depreciation of lira.
As a result, industry performance for 11 months was worse than last year's result, as reported by Bloomberg, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were produced in November in Turkey, 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
Some 75,900 vehicles were sent for export, more than 25 per cent less than last year.
And while Turkey’s road sector showed a positive trend towards last year after the first 10 months of this year, after the 11 months of 2021, car production was 0.3 per cent lower than last year’s.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November lost 29 per cent of the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 HCMs received a credit grace period in 2021
The First Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, reported on the situation of small and medium-sized business benefits, transmitting to the MIA correspondent Kazinform.
“According to information provided by the Agency for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, pursuant to an instruction of the Head of State dated 1 April 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 of 9 April 2021 approving the procedure for the granting of deferred payments on loans to small and medium-sized businesses,” wrote Alihan Smailov in his reply to the parliamentary request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferred loan payments included the provision by banks and microfinance organizations of deferred loan payments to HCMs, including IPs, prior to 1 April 2021, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The duration of the postponement was 30 to 90 days at the choice of the HCMs subject.
The borrower ' s application may have indicated a different period of deferment.
During the grace period, the borrower's claims and actions were suspended, notice of the need to settle the arrears, and the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments”, noted the Deputy Prime Minister.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for deferred payments on loans from 603 MSB borrowers, of which 553 MSB entities received deferred payments amounting to 9.7 billion tenge.
IFIs have received applications for deferral from 131 ISF entities, of which 95 entities have been granted a stay of 105.8 million tenge”, concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with low immunity can easily bear the strain of "Ocmirone"
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity can handle it more easily than those with a strong protective reaction.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "Ocmiro" could be dangerous.
The cause is to be found in the context of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that the “Ocmyrone” originated in the body of an HIV-positive or immune-deficiency person.
I mean, in mutation, he didn't find any resistance to immunity.
It's a more aggressive way of doing it.
Because there was no answer to immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, he's got these hiccups, spikes, maybe more than he should have, their antibodies weren't cut during mutations, and he's commenting on the pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity can carry the Ocmyrones more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction to the body.
Turns out the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, it's not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's how it happens with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-olds die, and the 60-year-olds experience it as a sneeze.
The young man’s immune response is completely inadequate: where he could only have been threatened with a finger, he beats the sparrow like a gun, Sergei Puryasev concluded.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects, and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, you can often bathe only symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of emerging pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication -- temperature, weakness, sickness.
Then there's the respiratory symptoms: difficult breathing, a perforation in the throat, coughing.
Pains on the right or on the left, abnormal pains can also be evidence of an emerging problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, a growing generation of 12 to 18 years of age can begin to be vaccinated before the end of the year.
Virusologist Pavel Volchkov, head of the IFTI genomic engineering laboratory, noted that this category is very heavily affected by the cowboy.
Teenagers who go to school have as many contacts as possible.
It's the most socially active interlayer, like kindergarten kids, says "Moscow 24" by Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the IFTI genomic engineering lab.
Thank you very much for this article.
I'd love to refresh my memories...
Teath-In.
In those far-off '70s-80s, no dance floor was without the tunes of this group.
And at home, they would dance with their friends for their music.
Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why obese people are victims of the covis.
The authors examined the fatty tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could be infected with coronavirus.
The immune cells in the adipose tissue, the macrophagus, also contracted, showing a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the fatty tissue of patients who died of the cove and found particles of coronavirus in the fat surrounding the various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid an immune response.
That's probably what SARS-CoV-2 is capable of.
The biologist described the causes of dementia.
Semen Golosheikin, a biologist, described the causes of dementia and how to prevent it in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from the disease.
The syndrome manifests itself in the gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty adjusting even in a familiar environment.
Holosheikin noted that neurodemensive disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders and lack of certain vitamins are the most common causes of dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, increased cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social exclusion and lack of active cognitive activity were possible”, he said.
Dementia is also affected by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and low mobility.
Among the early signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decline in abstract thinking.
“There is discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor”, added a biologist.
In order to prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of fitness, cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.

N.I. Pyrogova, head of cognitive disorders at the Federal Center of Brains and Neurotechnics, Anna Bogolebova, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned some 30,000 illegally removed artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo Government has managed to repatriate some 30,000 artefacts that have been smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, December 11, Al-Hayat, the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Shaaban Abdel Gauad, reported on this.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has recovered 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were found at the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C., he said.
Abdel Gauad explained that all smuggled artifacts were recorded in the archives.
The Department is now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists “trace auctions worldwide and Internet sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social media.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural property was restored upon return and then displayed in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was the ancient skeleton of a man found in Belgium, who is now part of an exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the auctioned bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamon in London.
The auction house Christie's held an auction on 4 July in which a bust of over 3,000 years of age was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This has caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art item was illegally removed from the Karnak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamon, depicted as the sun god of Amon, has been stored in a private collection and has not been tendered since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities illegally removed from the country at various times in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by black diggers.
“The Crimean Tatars are not included”, and that is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (near to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people - so many Tartars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of that people is two words!
Only the Turkic language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
In Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount for the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications operator partner.
Under current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees as they are used to handle business with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if a staff member used it to meet a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have moved to remote mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to deal with business issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank management had set a deadline for staff to familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new claim.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Jesenin's life, 1925, was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the world's most difficult poet and his ego.
He's already outside any literary association, he's disintegrating with imageginism, he's on his own, but he's known to be in demand, he's sometimes strong-mouthed with critics, even viciously, but the reading public is ready to carry it.
Over 60 poems have been written in the course of the year, many of them are real masterpieces, completed the cycle of "Perish Motivation", written the poem "Anna Snegina", published eight books, a compilation of "Rhyus Soviet".
And the main success was in late June 25th, the State Secretary signed a contract with Yesenin to publish his 3rd volumes.
No contemporary Sergei Alexandrovich has ever been so honored, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money, with a fee of 1,000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, 300 rubles per month for the factory director and 200 for the engineer).
The money was needed more than ever that year.
Hesenin married Lion's granddaughter Tolstoy Sophier Tolstoy, who had to build a family home, support Katya and Sasha's sisters, and support her mother.
Life seemed to be getting better, there's something to be happy about, but for him, it's mostly in a dark tone, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Esenin) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where that pain came from.
The wind's whistling.
Over an empty field,
Just like I was growing in September,
She's brainwashing alcohol.
Many acquaintances have pointed out that Jesenin has given up heavily, looks badly, and is clearly sick.
There's more and more ruckus, more and more nervous breakdowns.
And it's probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was attributed to Sergei Alexandrovich, there were no valid documents left.
For example, in May 1923, when Yesenin, at the urging of his fourth wife, the American women, Icedora Duncan, corrected their health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gunnushkin (again, Jesenin will be there two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of singing a poet, the scandals on this soil, the police's record is ample, scattered across dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the poet's terrible novel with a green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Jesenin moved in with his friend Ivan Startsev for a short time.
Surprisingly, Yesenin never had a home in Moscow, he never had a home in Peter, he found it in rented apartments, hotels, or acquaintances.
The old people remember:
"He only came to sleep at night, and in most cases in an insane, drunken state.
One day, returning at 4 a.m., Jesenin fell on the stairwell...
When he fell, he scratched his face and snored.
When he regained consciousness, he began to cough constantly, spraying the entire sheet with blood..."
Yes, and Yesenin himself, after a tour of Europe and the U.S. (there was a dry law in the States at the time, but Duncan brought with her a decent supply of alcohol), admitted:
"I've never seen anything in there, except the boar and the street...
I'm at the end, and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, I drank, of course...
And I drank because I'm so sad."

Matt Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Economy is a modern implementation of the budget model in the premium-class ruler.
The base of the mattress is a block of Duet's independent double springs.
A softer spring of smaller size is inserted inside the large spring.
This allows the burden on the mattress to be evenly distributed.
On both sides, the mattress is supplemented by a full-blown, artificial latex.
It's an analogue of natural latex, but it's denser and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material increases the comfort of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it doesn't absorb moisture and dust.
A mattress would be great for a couple with a large difference in weight (from 30 kilograms).
At the expense of smart springs, there's no wave effect when the light partner rolls to the heavy side.
Pleasant, soft on the touch of a practical Sense jacket will be tested with a layer of Synthepon.
Natural tissue doesn't accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to make this model of mattress in a twisted version (vacuum roll pack).

So what?
He will.

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus uses migrants as “weapons” against the EU.
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus uses migrants as “weapons”
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Jablonsky, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used the refugees as “weapons” against the European Union and intended to return to such an “operation” next year.
In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a related statement.
According to Jablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily “stopped Lukashenko,” but he “is actively seeking new ways”.
Also, a Polish official is confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As kp.ru wrote, the European Union had earlier launched the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It addressed 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their willingness to further expand restrictive measures against the Republic “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of products from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not Sensei hat," when a velvet jacket makes a man a joke.
velvet jackets dominated the social events of 2021.
Perhaps the first person to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
As early as September, he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional "bonda" butterfly at the premiere of "It's not time to die."
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first put on a green velvet jacket that was not appropriate to the royal dress code, and then chose a more classical version for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was on itself and Lionel Messiah.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in the Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same clothes.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet male jackets in Russia.
According to the service analysts at Gazeta.Ru, they were purchased 1.4 times more frequently.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with linings and silhouettes, the main colors are dark beige, Bordeaux, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is between 3,000 and 6,000 roubles, and men prefer to buy velvet suits exclusively.
It's not just online dealers who can buy them.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
The velvet jacket segment of this season features almost all brands - both Brioni and Paul Smith, and Etro and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which it appeared on one of the premieres of "Gucci House" by Jared Leto's brand ambassador.
By choosing expensive stamps, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
A special thread binding technology produces a dense fabric with a gross exterior texture and smooth inner face.
More budgetary options are made up of cotton or polyamide, but they also serve less.
The fashioned expert, Lamoda Ilya Wahoshkin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, it's not his model or appearance that matters, it's the relevance.
"Barhat demands evening light, so such a jacket is perfect if you're going to a party or a celebration," explains Wahoshkin. "He's also appropriate if the invitation contains the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie."
Another important criterion for choosing a velvet jacket is the status of its purchaser.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, needs to have the right, advanced party with wealth," says the Telegram Channel of Men's Fashion, "Breaky Brammell." "The owners of velvet jackets usually belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They're just invited to social events, where the dress code is always shown.
Ilya Wahoshkin proposes combining a velvet jacket with the same outfits: classic pants with arrows, one-ton shirts, silk ties, Lophers with brushes, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
The fashionable experts at Brammel's are convinced that it would be inappropriate for a private employee to appear on the company's velvet jacket, but if it's the "leader of this event, yes," that's the thing.
If the employee is lower in rank and his purpose is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to kick out financial bonuses, he or she should not wear a velvet jacket.
Management will certainly appreciate that with the phrase "not on Senka hat," they think the editors of the Telegram channel are about male fashion.
It's a very mixed feeling from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so tormented.
And he's completely unconnected with the pretty face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you the best of luck in life!
It's about money-- alternative energy is lobbying well, so it's paying off.
A billion-dollar investment.
Are they in grief?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also out of the question - gas, oil, and coal have been bought cheaper than they are now.
Fuel demand is wild.
There's a penny dripping.
Then who's in trouble?
As usual, a private buyer.

I haven't seen a single handsome person in the pictures in the article.
Just mediocrity within average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, they will probably not.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful" women, but certainly not because of their appearance.

Immunologist stated that revaccination in four to five months would help protect against a strain of coronavirus.
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection.
That was the statement made by the immunologist Nikolai Krüčkov, who called the inoculation after six months, given the emergence of a new strain, "a very large period."
“In previous strains, this was normal, but now it is best to perform the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four months,” the expert called for revaccination in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kruchkov also noted that early revaccination provided a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person was given two shots and a booster, or he was overdosed and vaccinated, or immunized and overzapped, he was given "hybrid immunity," i.e. antibodies are many and neutralized enough," the expert explained.
The G-7 warned Russia of “scale consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
The G-7 countries (United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the United States) issued a statement on the outcome of the Liverpool meeting of MFA heads.
It stresses that Russia's “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have enormous consequences and will be costly” in Moscow, but the concrete measures are not described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,” the statement states.
The Ministers further call on Russia to “save escalation, use diplomatic channels and abide by its international obligations with regard to transparency of military activities”, as President Biden of the United States spoke of during a video call to President Putin on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Norman format to achieve full compliance with the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the G-7 Foreign Ministers also state.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in return”, they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's cautious position.
We will intensify our cooperation on the basis of our common and comprehensive response,” the statement also states.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, stated that Russia would suffer “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed “the unified voice of the G-7 countries, which account for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have enormous consequences for Russia”.
Pfizer was found to be 32 times less effective from omicron stock.
The efficacy of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNtech against the coronavirus omicron-stamp is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, transmitting South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety," said Professor Malik Peiris.
However, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe current of disease in coronavirus.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the evolution of the coronavirus pandemic, given the impact of the omicron stamp on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron stamp could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality unless additional measures were taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking NATO arms shipments to Kiev.
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniping systems and rifles to defeat drones.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened its position on rifles by declaring them to be non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the above-mentioned weapons through bilateral agreements with allies.
These include the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania, and France.
FT notes, however, that the position of the new German Government, under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, regarding the authorization of arms shipments to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to supply arms to Chancellor Scholce.
According to him, the previous leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany had explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in Donbas, despite the “occupation by Russia” of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same “illogical” position, I'm sure, will be maintained by the diplomat, Germany, under the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski stated that Kiev expected help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected “to be a technical partner of Ukraine”, added the President.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, Robert Habek, Co-Chairman of the Green Party of Germany, visited the Republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

According to the second, Ferstappen beat Hamilton to the "restart" zone.

The G7 warned Russia of liability for the invasion of Ukraine
The G7 Foreign Ministers warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continued its military aggression against Ukraine, as indicated in the final statement of the parties.
The meeting also noted that it condemned the rise of Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
“The Russian Federation should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and costs,” states a statement published on the website of the British Government.
The Ministers of the G7 countries and the EU Supreme Representative noted that “they are united in their condemnation of Russian armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine”.
The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Elizabeth Trass, warned at a press conference in Liverpool of the “great consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to renounce aggression against Ukraine," she said.
Earlier at the Liverpool summit, the G7 Foreign Ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties needed to return to the negotiating table.
It was about the "Normand format" negotiations.
The North Atlantic Alliance also supported the dialogue on Ukraine in the “Normand format”.
The representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zakharova, stated that, in calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries had “signed in their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes”.

Ways to return stolen money through an Internet store have been discovered
There are several ways to recover the money stolen through Internet stores and not become a victim of future fraud.
They were discovered by information security experts in interviews with the RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data fall into the hands of perpetrators, it is recommended that fixed assets be stored in a map or bank account that is not used in online shopping.
A portion of the savings can be set aside in a savings account and transferred as necessary.
Experts also recommend the establishment of a separate map for online purchases.
If the money was stolen from shops that do not use 3D Secure security technology, a return procedure can be initiated.
“In accordance with the rules established by payment systems, unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure are the responsibility of the participant in the payment chain who does not use the service”, the representative of the Promlinkbank clarified.
The expert from the Ecompay international payment provider, Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer had the right to file an application with the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator uses a map on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be challenged and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases Internet shops themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Social Chamber member Catherine Mizulina, Director of the Safe Internet League, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud had been reported, ranging from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
She said that a single window for complaints against online fraud could be an effective solution under the current circumstances.
Scholz came to Poland to discuss the “North Flux 2” and EU legislation
Germany's newly elected Chancellor, Olaf Scholtz, arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline “Northstream 2”.
Although Scholz has stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries have expressed clear expectations from each other.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateus Moravetsky, stated that he would encourage Scholz to oppose the “Northstream 2” which would bring Russian gas to Germany by bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, for its part, supported Poland ' s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party “Law and Justice” violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its highest court ruled that national legislation took precedence over EU regulations.
The new German government sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the US, did not make a public commitment to stop Northern Flux 2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told Congress members that they had reached an understanding with Germany to stop the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, told a high-ranking US Congress official on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the G-7 on Sunday.
Dmitri, look closer.
The view outside the window is the same, the window size hasn't changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room was removed, so part of the second window is visible.
In fact, people who aren't familiar with the original plan are in doubt.
And I know these apartments very well, and I can see how they rescheduled them.
Let's make sure they're okay.
It's always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, the toilet, the windowsills, the cranes.
You wash them once a year on Easter or something, which you have to wash.
Just don't get dirty.
The Ministry wants to give the writers residences.
The State will hand over to the future Fund for Support of Russian Letters the federal property left by the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR.
It will be based on the creation of authorial residences, and has been notified to the Parliamentary Gazette in the Ministry of Civil Affairs, which will be the founder of the foundation.
The Ministry is preparing a draft presidential decree for the establishment of the Fund for Support of Russian Letters.
The Explanatory Note states that the Foundation will be entrusted with the task of, among other things, targeting and preserving buildings and buildings formerly owned by the Soviet Writers Union and the Lit Fund.
“The Russian Federation has taken possession of a large number of properties previously owned by the USSR Literary Fund, including those located in the town of the writers of Perrelkino, the village of Komarovo in Leningrad oblast and others”, reported the Parliamentary Gazette in the Ministry's press service.
The draft decree requires that the statute of the Fund should state that it “is being prepared to facilitate literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for literary creativity”.
“The creation of conditions for creative activity is understood to mean the creation, on the basis of transferred property, of written residences in different regions of Russia in which the conditions for creativity would be comfortable”, explained our publication at the Ministry of Civil Affairs.

Doctors warned of the danger of prolonged use of excreta after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Jartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned of the danger of uncontrolled use of excreta products following the coronavirus infection of COVID-19 and before vaccination against the coronavirus.
Irina Jartseva, an immunologist, said that the self-prophylaxis of possible clot formation after COVID-19 could cause a stroke.
Yartseva explained that not all blood-fevering drugs were intended only if the patient had been hospitalized, had been in hospital, and had suffered complications.
The doctor uses anti-coagulants (blood-fevering drugs, obstructing excessive clot formation) on the basis of evidence.
She reported that there was now a darkening, long-term drinking of anti-coagulants and, against that background, suffering from hemorrhagic strokes (brain hemorrhage).
The chief prophylacticist of Urfo, the scientific head of the Society of Preventive Medicine, and the doctorate of medical sciences, Sergei Tokarev, in a conversation with URA.RU, said that anticoagulants are now indiscriminately used by Russians before being vaccinated for coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe questionable advice on the Internet and start self-medicating.
There are citizens who decide to take anti-coagulants a week before vaccination.
And when they're pre-immunized, doctors notice bruises.
He stressed that it was extremely dangerous to take any medication without knowing the cause of any symptom.
Potato was called a super-product to protect against hypertension.

Our money in the church wall will be paid $20,000 to the plumber.
The plumber who found money in a church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in a press release issued by Crime Stoppers of Houston, a non-profit organization.
The incident took place in the major evangelical church of Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that God - fearing Christians will be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, Justin Caughley repaired one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of bags of money and cheques under thermal insulation.
He passed on the finding to the church and, according to him, did not receive even a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do," quotes KPRC-TV.
Apparently, the discovery was linked to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques that were kept in the church safe were then gone.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any loss.
Nevertheless, a 25,000-dollar reward was announced for information about criminals.
Justin Caughley could not claim this amount because the award had expired.
In spite of this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at the time had spent $5,000 on the award and later received another $20,000 from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the integrity of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
Previously, it was reported that the police had interrogated Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her remarks, her actions are her characterization as a real person.
That's why the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it's not that "she's financially richer than any writer," as they say here.
There are richer people, but not everyone behaves as arrogantly as this madam.

China has a new case of human infection with avian influenza virus.
A new human infection with the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus has been detected in China.

In Brazil, citizens were required to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, Luis Roberto Barroso, a judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF), was ordered to require a passport to enter the territory of the State.
CNN Brasil reports it.
Citizens who have counter-inoculations are exempted from the vaccination certificate.
Also on the list of exceptions are persons coming from countries where the lack of a vaccine has been proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's parties, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flows”, noted Barroso.
Previously, Brazilian authorities had ordered anti-coronavirus tourists to comply with a five-day quarantine.
Full protection against COVID-19 exposed
A virusologist, doctor of medical sciences, a well-deserved Russian scientist, Anatoly Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
This, he said, could be achieved through injection and the use of a nasal vaccine.
Internasal use produces a large amount of immunoglobulin A. Injection does not occur when the vaccine is administered.
Immunoglobulines A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus can't penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulin G (antitela).
And if you inject both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's no solution to double vaccinations yet," the medic said.
Urfo's chief prophylacticist, Dr. Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help to ensure that the protection of the body was supposed to be the highest possible.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of Nizhgorod oblast, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic would result in the spread of new coronavirus infections among children.
He said that that was the situation in other countries, where another wave of the pandemic had occurred earlier.
Inna, um...
I've been talking to a cobele, if you're willing to trade for a warm house, a cormac, a pet, love, and a game for a bitch, go ahead.

I've stopped many of the owners from chasing after the dog, even though they've paid that there's 200,000 people running away, taking their hands and taking them the other way.
In the end, "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog, who was running out there somewhere.
Mass protests against vaccination continue unabated in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make the vaccination against the covis mandatory.
As of February next year, uninhibited people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spanish, outraged by the authorities ' health policies, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held posters that said, "It's a false pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, a covid certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports in several regions of the country was taken against the backdrop of an increase in coronavirus infections.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then developed into a clash with the security forces.
A group of demonstrators started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even Wikipedia doesn't agree on this.

WHO has detected “micron” already in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that a new strain of coronavirus had already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of distribution of the strain was described in a WHO report.
According to the organization, the strain had already been detected in 63 countries as at 9 December, in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has not been actively disseminated since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new version of the coronavirus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain may, according to preliminary data, bypass the spread of the delta strain, as well as the Indian version of the coronavirus, which now leads in all countries without exception.
Prior to that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Gebreijesus, stated that the omicron postum could have a significant impact on the progress of the coronavirus pandemic.
A similar conclusion was reached in Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that “micron” will replace “delta” in the coming months.
And the number of patients in Britain alone will be about 1 million. That's with a few hundred people officially sick in the Kingdom at the moment, and an estimate of up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the amicron strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals every day.
What the British health care system won't be able to handle.
The situation is complicated by the fact that recent studies show that the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine against the amicron strain is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
How the Russian "Sputnik V" reacts to the "micron" is not yet known - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalea Center has only just begun testing the Russian vaccine on a strain of the Amicron.

Israel's Premier Bennett reported on the start of vaccinations in schools
The Israeli Ministry of Health is starting an emergency vaccination programme on Sunday.
In the morning of 12 December, vaccinations against the coronavirus were conducted in schools throughout Israel.
The Prime Minister of the Jewish State, Naftali Bennet, said at today's Cabinet meeting that the issue of vaccination of the fourth dose of citizens at risk would also be examined.

The vaccination of 12-15-year-olds in that country began in early June this year.
Currently, more than 5.78 million people have received both doses, while the third has received more than 4.12 million.

$135 billion went to apps-- Hi-Tech.
In 2021, user expenditures in the applications increased by 25 per cent worldwide and downloads by 8 per cent.
Various video services were the most popular in the world.
The users downloaded CapCut's video editor the most, and spent the most on YouTube.
Both the number of downloads and user costs of the applications showed a significant increase between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. The user costs in the applications increased even more significantly, by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
The data were published by App Annie, an analytical company that submitted a market report on mobile applications in 2021.
In 2021, the world economy withdrew from the lokdown and began post-Pandemic recovery.
“Does this return to the physical growth of the applications economy? Nothing,” the authors of the report believe.
India led the downloads of the apps, accounting for about 20 per cent of all downloads.
It is followed by the US (9%) and Brazil (8%).
IOS users used to spend more on iOS than on Android users: iOS accounted for 65 percent of the total costs in the applications.
The CapCut video editor ranked first in downloads in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian applications: the MX TakaTak video service and the Meesho online trading application.
Telegram is also included in the top 10 downloads.
In general, based on the number of downloads, VPN services (two to the top 10 are VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to video production and broadcasting (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, the top 10 include two more such services, Moj and SnackVideo).
“The users have spent most of their time on live and online streaming,” the report notes.
This is where YouTube leads, and the top 5 user costs include TikTok, Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as the Japanese Piccoma manga subscription service.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom, and TikTok are the first monthly active users, and the top 5 mobile version of Microsoft Office is closed.
In Russia, the number of downloads per year led to the AliExpress shopping app.
It's followed by Zenly's service, which shows the location of friends, and still the same CapCut.
The top 10 applications also include: StarMaker online caraoke, Shein online clothing director, Maps for Minecraft PE application, DiDi online taxi service, YouTube Pure Tuber client, Dixie application, and Samokat online store.
Throughout the world, people have adapted to the pandemic through the transition to a life in Mobile, which is one of the main conclusions.
The most successful industries were those that helped people get closer, both virtually and personally," commented the report's head of marketing research, App Annie Lexi Sidow.
The mobile game sector earned $90 billion in 2021. The leaders in the number of downloads turned out to be casuual and hypercasual games, with little or no story, and the video form was minimal.
The top three of the world's most popular games included Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, DOP 2: Delta One Part, Going Balls, and Phone Case DIY lead the games.
Previously, App Anne had submitted her forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of the following year, the company's analysts cited the growth of the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the increase in popularity in the Z generation of financial applications, such as the Robinhood investor apps, and the further increase in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russia has been warned of a new scheme of fraud
The intruders began to look for new manoeuvres for video fraud.
It's written in "News" with a reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's product director, Zaura Abutalimova, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communications is the diphexies.
In this case, fraudsters create fake videos based on actual records involving the victim.
This neurosete is able to reproduce the behavior of a person in an accurate way.
Abouthalimov added that using a diphtheic, intruders could call victims' acquaintances by video link or create a video with a copy of a person for blackmail.
“Such forgeries can easily cause a bulling because a codged intruder can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
The leading system engineer, Varonis Alexander Wetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video-based technologies.

Five actions listed to help avoid diabetes mellitus
Blood sugar problems are among the most common in the world.
Some, however, do not attach much importance to it, and it is in vain.
Diabetes can lead to severe complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a central role in preventing the emergence of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the variety of drinks and switching to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweets increase blood sugar to a dangerous level when used in excess quantities.
So the first step to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The disease is affected not only by malnutrition but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes mellitus, you have to move a lot.
Experts recommend a low - carbon diet.
Such a diet would not only help to reduce weight, but would also protect against sudden fluctuations in sugar levels.
In order to protect against diabetes, you have to eat a lot of fibers.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to a sense of satisfaction, digestive juices, and food intake.

Dr. Pavlova told me about the day off migraines of workaholics.
A few factors may lead to a deterioration of well-being over the weekend.
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working hours is often the “time of the weekend”, described by a well-known endocrinologist, a doctor of medical sciences, a senior researcher at the Department of Basic Medicine of the Ministry of Health, and the scientific director of the Zuhra Pavlov Clinic for System Medicine in his cable channel.
She said that workaholics who suffer from headaches, fractures and weaknesses during the weekend are particularly affected.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the week’s accumulated fatigue, there are many objective reasons for the body’s negative reaction to changing conditions.
Our lives change dramatically over the weekend.
"Sleep long, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less," the doctor argued.
Because of overeating and lack of water, it's heavy and broken."
Late recovery plays an additional role.
So if you get up three hours later than usual, there's a reaction called the Jetlag.
It comes from travellers who cross a number of time zones.
In order to determine which of the factors are crucial to the deterioration of well - being, Pavlova recommended that we find out what changes most during the weekend.

South African scientists have reported a low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "micron"
In South Africa, the Pfizer vaccine against "mikron" was reported to be ineffective.
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa have conducted research and reported a low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the coronavirus omicron staff.
It is estimated to be 22.5 per cent of the vaccine's (meekron neutralization level) efficacy against symptoms, which ... questions the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, as stated in the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
However, the experts explained that the drug could be saved from a serious disease.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that a coronavirus omicron would cause a new wave of pandemics in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars in the usual food?
Sugar is not the best source of good nutrients.
Its excess in diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as to cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should bear in mind that hidden sugar, similar to calorie sugar, composition and glycemic index, may be included under an unknown word in the product.
Several dozen names, essentially for sugar, can be displayed on the label.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrosis (sahar derived from maize), leftulose (fruit sugar), melasse (black molice), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that are mono- and disacharides, and they can be not only in confectionery but also in ketchup, doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce sugar consumption, they say, is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar vary in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, treated or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since not only the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholtz: Gas will lose importance to Germany in 25 years.
The new Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, said that gas imports were no longer important to Germany as the country continued to decarbonize the economy.
He said that Germany was planning to phase out gas, oil and coal completely by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will have a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continued to be committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource was now important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement recording Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation.
Formerly head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annalena Berbok, stated that the process of certification of the North Stream 2 gas pipeline was continuing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and negotiation of the coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should apply to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline was still “not in conformity” with the EU regulations.

In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
However, the level of participation in this third ballot was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, the “independence” of New Caledonia from France was expressed by 3.51% (2,755), while 96.49% (75,762) voted “no”.
The turnout was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians participating in the elections.
As these interim results of France-Presse comment, “the outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubt”, as the supporters of independence called on voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed the referendum on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago was preventing a full and “honest” campaign.
This non-participation thus paved the way for the third victory of the French New Caledonian supporters, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, and in 2020 53.3 per cent voted against independence.
According to the separatists, they will not accept the results of the last vote and will contest them at the UN.
On Sunday, 12 December, it was reported that the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, was to speak on the outcome of the referendum at the Elise Palace.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence has in many ways revived the presidential campaign in France in recent weeks.
Several presidential candidates have expressed their preference for the Territory to remain in France, as it is “the last region of the European Union presence in the Pacific”.
“New Caledonia must remain French,” Eric Zemmoor repeatedly said.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecres, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro encouraging the Caledonians to remain French.
For its part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it is not his responsibility”.
Nevertheless, the President added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia”.
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France”.

Turkey experienced the world's first drone with laser weapons
Turkey has successfully tested the world's first laser drone.
"Eren" has been tested at a distance of 100 to 500 metres, reports "MIR24".
The machine is capable of neutralising explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight height of the new one is 3,000 metres.
Once tested, UAVs should be used by Turkish military personnel to destroy explosive devices without the use of deminers.
The Agency stresses that Turkey is one of the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ readers criticized the article on Russia-US relations
The readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article, in which he described his vision of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
The author expressed concern that the West was allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger posed by Moscow and made a number of offensive remarks against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on the Western countries to “stand united against Russia”.
The readers of WSJ expressed their opposition to the position of the American professor.
"There's a lot of false information in this article," RIA News quotes a comment from a reader.
"Europe is not ours to lose it, and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine's sake," another noted.

A 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred in the Kuril Islands
The 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred near the smoking island of Shikotan.
The epicentre of the earthquake was reported to be 231.8 km north-east of the city of North Curilsk.
It lays at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists recorded an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 in Peru, in which 10 people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing a new generation of jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish factory will start to build an ANKA type of unmanned jet aircraft (UAV).
This was reported on 11 December by the freelance adviser to the head of the Ukrainian office of President Kareni Arrestovic.
So they're capable of acting against air objects, against other drones.
Even against a manned aircraft.
They're going to have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics, the hull and so on," quotes his Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA's equipment, Arrestovic explained that it was a jet drone, not a piston drone.
According to him, it's a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed its "by all its characteristics."
The first shipment of UAVs is due to be made by the factory at the end of next year, and has been arrested.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The previous day, the Ukrainian General Staff had classified the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations by the combined forces in Donbas.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, reported that the construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
He said that Ukraine intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence concluded an agreement on the construction of a centre in the Kiev region, which will provide training and testing and maintenance of Turkish BAFL Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the memorandum “a major real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
The lions escaped at Changi Airport in Singapore.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape a container of seven lions arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were going.
One of the runaway lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals couldn't get away from him because of the safety net set up next to him.
The standoff ended with the arrival at the airport of Mandai Wildlife Group employees, who manage all the zoos in Singapore.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion had escaped from the owner and walked the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, the people were not injured.
Experts warned of the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies have shown that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less at risk of contracting certain types of cancer, particularly coloric cancer.
However, the excess dose, on the other hand, contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
A professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Dietologist Beth Kitchin, recommends monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if there is a substantial deviation from that figure, either more or less.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in pills without a doctor’s recommendation, to monitor dosage, and to avoid milkflakes and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, food consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it is contained in, among other things, avocados, Fine recommended that men more often eat the fruit after 50 years.
In the UK, about 75,000 people may have died by April because of the omicron stamp.
The predictions by British scientists suggest that the spread of the coronavirus omicron plaster could cause up to 75,000 deaths in England in the next five months, unless the restrictive measures are tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, referring to a study by experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which broadcasts TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the British Cabinet Emergency Research Advisory Group, at least 25,000 deaths due to the Omicron strain will have been recorded in the country by April 2022, and a total of approximately 175,000 patients will have been hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 cases per day.
“Serious measures to control the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from becoming overburdened if the omicron post is more contagious than the delta option and the active vaccines can't rule out the infection,” said Mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Previously, the British Health Safety Agency had reported that if the rate of Omicron Stam was maintained at current levels, some 1 million cases would have been detected by the end of the year.
By mid-December, however, the strain of omicron could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, 1,898 cases of coronavirus Omicron Stamma have been detected in Britain, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
However, on 9 December, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Jaweed, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superchats has risen by a quarter in the world.
This year’s superchat construction and next year’s orders beat the world’s record despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the world registry was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In the era of climate change mitigation, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the will and the money to buy a floating fortress for 50 million pounds or more will not decrease, writes Guardian.
However, they are growing.
This year, 25 per cent more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say it's been 20 years since the market's been so agitated.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear contamination on land and prefer to escape the pandemic on their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If all of these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners personally, most of them now work remotely, and they negotiate on their own.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that shipyards take orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more as long as their yacht is ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior by the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, the sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of travel to space, life on yachts or flying on their own planes is irritating to society because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists call on governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they realize that with such mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to do so.
In the meantime, only the number of super-yahts ordered is impressive, but their characteristics are also impressive.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building the REV Ocean yacht, which is 183 metres long.
It's going to be the biggest boat in the world after we hit the water.
There is a “moon pool” on the boat, as well as a submarine designed to study sea depths.
On the existing super-chats, it was common to become helicopter sites, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as McGregor's fighter's yacht, a platform for martial arts. Professor of economic anthropology at the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that carbon footprints produced by super-rich people are small compared to the total number of greenhouse gas electors.
But it is symbolic, considering that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of over-consumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than that of the average resident of the planet.
While one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, Roman Abramovic's largest polluter is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trail sank on his Eclipse yacht with a length of 162.5 metres.
Even if the owner is not on board the boat, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and order a boat from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, for example.
Superchat owners are not sympathetic to other people when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no space for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships 50 meters away.
A dangerous week-long dose of alcohol leading to intestinal cancer has been identified
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of cancer.
This is the subject of the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the use of four or more alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of cancer.
However, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in alcohol consumption.
Moreover, moderate-drinking men have a higher risk of intestinal cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of this type of oncology, simply noting that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or more precisely, dog lovers believe that these creatures are very clever.
But even they don't know how developed four-legged pets are.
Over the years, biologists have carried out various experiments to see for themselves how intelligent animals are.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as that of humans, a new study shows that a dog can react consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, they don't understand the economy, they don't know the art, they often fool their masters.
Some of the species believe experts are doing better in understanding the words of human language, but statistics are not yet sufficient for accurate conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses, such as Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and that they are not less than a two - year - old child in terms of learning ability.

Ukraine is ready to trade with the US and Russia.
The U.S. and Russia will "trade" for Ukraine's entry into NATO, as stated by analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the publication "Glass".
In his view, Washington and Moscow were planning to continue negotiations on United States safeguards in the near future, that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden on the right of countries to “enter anywhere”.
If you're offered something that's obviously unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not gonna bargain, you're just gonna send the offerer.
And for Ukraine, there's going to be a tender," wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine, but was seeking a dialogue with Kiev.
“Training is carried out in secret, quickly and immediately to offensive action, rather than waiting for the group to detect and deploy the opposing forces”, he noted.
China promotes the development of the rail transport industry
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail and Equipment Exhibition of 2021, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province/Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, as noted by the representative of Howe Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running along the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will enhance the reliability and operation of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased rail vehicle exports and many countries in Asia and Europe have witnessed China's speed.
In May of this year, the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China for export to Europe came down from the production line of CRRC Zhuzu Locomotive Co..
At a maximum speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the pilot operation of the subway train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will be on the subway line connecting the centre of Istanbul to the airport of the city.
This subway line will open next year.
It'll be the fastest subway line in Turkey at 120 kilometers per hour.
“The Chinese railway equipment industry is one of the most innovative industries and the strongest international innovative competitiveness,” said Feng Yaosyan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade Promotion/CCMT/.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of China’s production of high-end equipment on the world market,” Feng Yaosyan said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of aids and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosyan, the country has the highest level of railway electrification and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed early signs of dementia.
Semen Golosheikin, a biologist, in a conversation with Radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive disorders, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and reduced abstract thinking.
There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, said the specialist.
Holosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s and vascular aterosclerosis were the most common causes of the syndrome.
The biologist noted that, to date, doctors do not know how to treat dementia effectively.
It is therefore necessary to begin prevention in a timely manner.
He said that learning foreign languages and active communication would help to reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic.
“There are recommendations for the application of different BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community”, Goloschikin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of moderate levels of physical stress, the regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and thinking logic,” Goloschekin said.
Previously, a British dementia charity stated that people over 40 years of age are increasingly affected by the disease.
Medics called early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign is visual problems, which make it difficult for a patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia was called aphasia, a state in which a person could not find the right words to convey what he wanted to say.
Neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needs psycho-nerved treatment and rehabilitation abroad, told journalists neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical consiliatorium set up under the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading in his illness.
The problems of movement, coordination, variability of character are stable problems,” the expert said, noting that this is within the normative framework and that the ex-president now needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia,” Toidze noted, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after he was disciplined by prison officers.
Georgian policy had quickly been able to abolish punishment and regain its rights.

There were protests against COVID passports in Spain.
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, there was a protest against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, which was broadcast by Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become compulsory for entering bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
Many demonstrators went to the action without masks.
On their posters, they accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment facilities and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million coronavirus cases have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
There are also plans to impose restrictions on non-vaccinated persons in Russia.
Bills on a single QR code system were submitted by the Government to the State on 12 November.
It is envisaged that Russians will be able to visit mass events, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail trades, with either a certificate of inoculation or disease, or a medical treatment for vaccinations.
The same rules will be established for the travel of trains and aircraft.

Cool climb: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only involve 300 million citizens in winter sports, thus bringing together President Xi Jinping's 1 trillion yuan, but will also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taivu ski resort in Zhangjiakow, located near the venue of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening works are also being carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to compete internationally.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakow, there are problems with snow.
The main long-term objective is to provide a comfortable and interesting vacation at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers can become regulars.
However, that is still far from it.
Game adviser Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Each winter, an increasing number of Chinese go to the slopes.
Fiona, the snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take years to create a ski culture here, Downs thinks.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and build the necessary recreational infrastructure there.
The 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunley, near the Olympic Winter Games.
He noted that there had been a boom in winter sports tourism in recent years.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chunley, a fast railway was set up, and now no local citizen suffers without a job.
There are an increasing number of shops in the country selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, the meals of the national kitchen are served at public drinking points.
There's even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiva now.
China seeks to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders of major international competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach global levels.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty as a result of the pandemic, as reported to WHO
More than 500 million people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty because of the pandemic of coronavirus, which had slowed human progress towards universal access to health care, had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
On 12 December, WHO and WB published two complementary reports on the occasion of the International Day of Universal Health Coverage.
They noted that the pandemic had led to a breakdown in the provision of medical services and had caused undue stress in health systems.
In this regard, immunization coverage has declined for the first time in 10 years and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic had caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment”.
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket”.
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced that the coronavirus pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and that more than four billion people had little or no social support.

Reuters: The Taiwanese Minister has been disconnected from the "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House.
Taiwan's Digital Minister Audrey Tan's speech on the panel discussion during the U.S.-sponsored "Summit for Democracy" was transferred to a video-free mode, attesting to the YouTube summit.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the image was disabled at the White House's request.
According to them, the reason was a map that singled out Taiwan in colour from the PRC, which considered the island to be its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was drawn by a South African non-governmental organization, CIVICUS, and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was identified as green as “free” and China, the DPRK, Laos and Viet Nam as red as “closed”.
After the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the views of the panellists “do not necessarily express the position of the U.S. Government”.
PRC wasn't invited to the "Summit for Democracy."
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese Minister could have contradicted Washington’s “one-China” policy.
One of the agency's sources stated that after the map was displayed, the U.S. National Security Council had angryly contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan to be a separate country.
The Washington Summit for Democracy was held from 9 to 10 December, with the participation of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia wasn't invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov, editor-in-chief of the New Newspaper, called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary Yuri Averianov of the Russian Federation stated that the summit was carrying an anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge.

The New Shepard spaceship with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight.
The New Shepard spaceship of Blue Origin, with six tourists on board, made a suborbital flight on Saturday, December 11.
The trip, which was broadcast on the company's website, lasted a total of more than 10 minutes, after which the passenger capsule went down to Earth, reports TASS.
The launch vehicle was launched from a launch site in Van Horn, Texas, United States.
The ship reached an altitude of just over 100 kilometres, and space tourists found themselves in a state of weightlessness.
The launch vehicle itself landed at the launch site.
Blue Origin successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard with passengers on board on 20 July.

But what does it have to do with the number of children, age, pension fund, etc.?
Write that they haven't returned the money.
And that's how many and when they have kids, it's none of your business until they get these kids to hang around your neck.
And if that's not possible, what right do you have to judge them?
It's probably just in education so...
The chosen parents, themselves, dictate their own rules, frankly spitting on the existing ones.
What if it also applies to other areas of life, legal proceedings, etc.?
There are no laws written for them.
And what if Dad does adopt his method of education and education?
It's a terrible example for others. It's a bad one.

China strengthens prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities with land crossings
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the Council of State of the PRC issued a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities with land crossings in order to further prevent the entry of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities are required to provide a negative test result for nucleic acids COVID-19 obtained within 48 hours of departure.
Those who come to cities where land crossings are located must pass at least one test for nucleic acids COVID-19 upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be effective from the day when the provincial administrative units concerned determine and publish the zones of these towns until 15 March 2022.
It is also noted that cities with land crossing points that meet certain conditions may consider establishing buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The spring orthopaedic mattress OK Base is one of the most affordable models in the ruler.
A practical Balance Foam filler gives the mattress all the necessary orthopaedic properties, but leaves the price at the budgetary level.
This item is the optimal combination of price and quality.
Pena Balance is a modern material that comes from PPU.
The filler is hypoallergenic and safe.
That's why foam is widely used in industry.
Its safety and reliability are confirmed by a special certificate obtained in Europe, where such requirements are much more stringent than those of the Russians.
Another important quality of Balance Foam is her orthopaedicity: the material maintains the right position of a person throughout sleep.
As a result of the foam, the mattress acquired hardness below average, so the product is considered to be quite soft.
The main loader in the mattress is SuperSprings.
It's notable for the independent springs, and it's about 256 elements per square metre.
A practical unit is able to maintain a weight of up to 100 kg per sleeper, distributes the load and adapts the surface to the sleeper, reinforcing the orthopaedic quality of the foam.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on the “severe conclusion” between Russia and the United States.
In an interview with Izvesdam, the heads of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Ryabkov, assessed the prospects for Moscow's relationship with Washington.
He noted that the long road of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improved relations, it is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long road we have travelled with both the current administration and Trump and Obama.
The trouble didn't start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US’s desire to impose on Russia approaches on many questions.
The DFA’s chapter added that he would not risk optimistic predictions about the prospects for improved relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, there had been no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heeded and that Americans will listen to common sense arguments.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, in a meeting with United States Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow was ready to re-establish a dialogue with the United States.
Virusologist warned of the danger of vaccination with a COVID Nazi drug outside hospitals
Those infected with the COVID-19 Nazi vaccine may have allergies and will require medical assistance, so it is not appropriate to set up the first entry points for the drug at airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by TASS to the virologist, a RAN correspondent member, the laboratory of biotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsi State University Sergei Netesov.
It's easier to set up nasal vaccination facilities at airports and shopping malls, but I'd only do that in the first place in health facilities.
The fact of the matter is that there is a possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, but it is not very likely, but it is desirable that a person then sit next to a doctor’s office.
Doctors have special anti-allergy kits that operate within a minute or two, which are sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, vaccinations at shopping centres could be considered when experience with the use of the drug was available.
He also stressed the importance of using a nasal vaccine to reach the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the ingested nose is blown out after injection.
A canvas painting, an anime "demon-scattering clinch" 5426 40x60.
Do you want to feel like a real artist?
Painting is interesting for both children and adults.
Because a lot of people like to draw, but sometimes they don't have the ability or the skills.
It's a simple, but very fascinating exercise that allows you to relax, realize creative potential, and create masterpieces with your own hands.
There's a lot of unusual paintings and unbeatable stories in the range!
We're developing current stories on our own, and we're trying to make you happy!
It's very simple!
When painted, the contours applied to the canvas are not "floating", they are not dissolved by water.
Each segment is numbered so it doesn't get lost in paint.
The finished painting will become a vivid feature of the environment, a raisin of the interior that attracts attention at first sight.
And this painting wasn't painted by some artist.
You drew it yourself.
With your own hands!
Serbia produced 2 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine
Sputnik V is the most popular vaccine in Serbia.
Serbia produced about 2 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, and the Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of the country, Nenad Popovic, told TASS.
“The Torlac State Institute has still produced about 2 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine, expecting a minimum of 4 million to be produced in the coming period,” Popović noted.
He said that the Russian vaccine was the most popular among Serbs.
Therefore, the Republic plans to purchase an additional million doses of vaccine from Russia.
The Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of Serbia has also expressed an interest in the production on the territory of the State of the nasal vaccine Sputnik V and the drug Sputnik Light.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin reported that the Russian Federation had delivered almost two million doses of the domestic coronavirus vaccine "Sputnik V" to Serbia.
Lama, they say the true believers are the church.

Because if they can tell themselves that they are true believers, so can others.
The Benarti Prime Orto S1000 145x190 matrix.
Prime Orto S1000 matrix with different sides of hardness, total height of mattress 22 cm.
Maximum permissible load per sleeping place up to 150 kg.
The base of the mattress is the independent spring block "S1000" (1,000 springs per sleeping place).
Each spring is in a separate tissue pocket, allowing the springs to distribute the body load correctly.
To further protect the spring block, an insulation layer has been added from the inlets separating mattress and spring fillers.
On the one hand, the mattress contains a layer of coconut coyre 3 cm high, which adds to the rigidity and durability of the mattress.
On the other side of the mattress, a layer of coconut coyre is added 3 cm and a natural latex 1 cm.
Natural latex has anatomical effects and durable properties.
The mattress's cap is made of a cotton giccard, propped up on Hollcon's organic material.
The tissue was treated with a special antibacterial impregnation Sanitized (Sweden).
Impregnation completely destroys fungi and prevents micro-organisms, dust mites and microbes from developing.
The mattress is equipped with four convenient flip handles, as well as aerators for additional ventilation of the mattress layers.
The perimeter mattress is further reinforced by a framework of artificial latex, which significantly increases its useful life.
Alexander M., would you remind me, please, what was the style of the marathon on FM 2021?
Do you see how classically the racers are supposed to finish?
Look, the question is, what does Clebo do to the right of Bolunov, and how does he want to get on the ski if he was walking in the corner before the door?
And "best finisher" by 1.5 km and after 50 km, that's two different things.
It's been a long time...
I was, and I wasn't actually a driver.
I had a license and I couldn't drive.
They've offered to drive 250 kilometers one way on MAZ!
Young, bad, agreed.
Master's here, drinking vodka, I'm on my way.
First, as king, he took the axial!
There's a column lined up behind me.
I missed it.
Then the belt on the Gur broke.
Then we got stopped by the henchmen.
The convoy was organized, and their car broke down.
We need to tow.
The master of MAZA explained that he was drunk, driving inexperienced.
How drunk are you?

In the United Kingdom, 1,239 cases of coronavirus omicron-stamp were detected in Russian in 24 hours.
In the United Kingdom, 1,239 cases of new coronavirus infection were detected in 24 hours.
Sky News informs you about this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of amicron have been detected in England, 38 people have contracted new infections in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of patients affected by COVID-19 from the new strain in the United Kingdom reached 3,137.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimated in pessimistic predictions that 75,000 people might die by April because of a coronary virus outbreak caused by a strain of the amicron.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Russian press spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive action” against Ukraine, including because of the alleged “invasion” of the country.
"Some restrictions to impose on Russia and not to suffer yourself are impossible," said the Kremlin's official on Russia One.
Peskov claims it's "understand by everyone in the world."
It has been previously reported that the US considers the introduction of anti-Russian energy sanctions as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the EU are planning to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
The head of Sberbank, Herman Greff, is convinced that this is impossible.
From the right thinking people, the right comments!
Something from simple to nauseating recipes is already nauseating.

What are you talking about?
Imagine you need to explain it on your fingers to an unwitting child, how will you do it?!
(Be advised, a child under the age of 3-5 still has channels of communication with the thin world, and the child may know more than you!)
New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
On December 12, the French television channel BFM.TV announced this.
Ninety-six.5 per cent of voters opposed independence.
Supported independence from France by 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
Cancelled 2.99% of the ballots.
The voting rate on that day was very low: about 55 per cent of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the sites.
According to the experts, the low turnout was due to calls by the separatists to withdraw from the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence had already been held in the region.
The majority of the inhabitants supported the presence of an archipelago within France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its own.
Some 270,000 people live in the archipelago and the Territory has a special administrative and territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, under which the region may organize a vote on its independence twice every two years.

WHO previously considers “micron” to be less dangerous than “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that “micron” is less dangerous than the coronavirus delta-stamp.
However, there is evidence of a decline in vaccine efficiency with the new version COVID-19.
According to 9 December, “micron” is registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and significantly modified antigen profile of protein of the amicron strain suggest that the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transmission of the option has been reduced.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it may be “heavy to disease” (red.) less severe than the delta, as stated in the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that, so far, all reported cases of “microne” infection in the EU have occurred easily or unsymptomly.
However, the new strain is reportedly spreading faster than the delta.
Two cases of Omicron Stamm were reported in Russia.
They've been "immunized before," reported to the Gamalea Center.
Rospetnadzor’s head, Anna Popova, has stated that there is as yet no reliable evidence that the new version of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were identified for Zelenski
The ex-deputate Verkhovna Rada, Vadim Denisenko, listed four options for Ukraine's President, Vladimir Zelenski, in 2022.
In his view, the head of State could be left without the support of the West and might compromise on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko reported on this in a publication on the Glaraz portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called “the perfect storm”, suggests that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries by reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“The price of the key products that we have traditionally exported has fallen in parallel,” added the ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario: “war against everyone”.
This projection will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, Ukraine’s leadership can make compromises on the Donbass, as a result of which it is possible to stand up within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, and the former Nardep says that this is likely to be up to 50-55 per cent.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is to confront those who disagree with the Green Group and the President, which is likely to lead to the seizure of control of the power bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
In this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reforming power", added Denisenko.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
This could be the result of an event that would be a great shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to trigger a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine”, Denisenko said.
This development is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological disaster or an aggressive action by Russia, and is considered by the ex-deputate.
On many occasions, however, the Russian side has rejected any possibility of an “aggression” against Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that are increasing military activity along Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, a survey of the sociological group Rating revealed that the Ukrainian president's rating had fallen to a record low of 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest rate since the election of its Head of State.
The analysts predicted a situation in which only 21.8 per cent would vote for the next presidential election, while 14.5 per cent for the former President, Peter Poroshenko, would vote for the President of Ukraine.
Of those interviewed, only 19.3 per cent expressed support for the President.

Thanks to the author for telling me about the great athlete, I didn't know Elena Shushunova had died, so it's very frustrating to find out.
I remember cheering for her at an olympiad in Seoul, for us people in the Primorsk region, it was live, real time.
It's a lot of passions, emotions are on the scale, and I remember the joy of Elena winning.
They also enjoyed other victories, like Salnikov, football players, and all the Soviet athletes.

The watermelons were terrible sizes.

I'm buying watermelons four to five kilos straight from the groove and not until early August.

Arrested for an action in Red Square by a poet: "For the quote of Evtushenko, 10 days give, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for 10 days.
The NSE student was detained in Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poeturssiabigpoet was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Evtushenko.
Alexander was given a report on the administrative article on the repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
He was first arrested on 23 January in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now unfortunately lost interest in it, to the decline of a common culture in Russia, and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag,” Alexander explains.
We contacted a young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal his message in more detail.
How have you been treated by the police this time and before?
What did the department ask you, how did they comment on your action?
This time, staff members were more correct, detention being as polite as possible, as funny as it sounds in some context of the word.
On Pushkin, the OMONs were taken and taken hard.
Asked in a standard way, about motive.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if disapproved, they understood.
With the exception of the four-way monkey, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was doing.
And if, after the stock, they start writing their poems, at least a few people, I'm gonna do 10 days for good.

Researchers described how potatoes help to cope with age disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that improve circulatory and cholesterol levels.
The roots contain vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, ribophlavine, foliar and pantotetic acid.
All these elements help the system function.
In addition, potatoes help to combat age disorders.
Because of its large cell content, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract and, with regular use, can also help to prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
For the most benefit, however, it is better to extinguish or boil root fruit rather than roast on oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as did other products with a high glycemia rate.
They're carbohydrates that quickly burst into sugar, like sugar, sweet, non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Kommersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian canteen potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, only imports can replace the deficit at this point in time.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates are removed from the Yandex issue.
Candidates for departure
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirated RuNet sites and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazarian, the director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive, including by regularly changing their domain name, he adds.
For example, the Lostfilm, which is available on both Yandex and Google's search engine, can be viewed as pirated copies of Netflix's "Game to Squid" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikian, the original series of Russia's largest video service iv (enters AVI).
On Kinogo, which is also available for the release of search engines, you can look at the animation novel Encanto, but from the quality of the video, it's a so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film in the cinema).
On Filmix, which is also available through search engines, the series "Universe. 10 Years Later" is available on TNT (accesses "Gazprom Media").
Svetlana M., I'm sorry, but I wouldn't care if my son resents my mother or not.

Ludmila, China's advanced space technology now.
Russia is already hopelessly behind.
"This idea developed by Poles" would be more accurate to say that Poland has only adapted the idea of 1776, but developed it quite effectively.
In fact, the slogan "Okraina is not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, by and large, doesn't make much difference.
I watched her interview, the girl said she had the biggest dream of having wings, and Dad was always pulling her off.
Well, it's kind of questionable.
So you went to college, and then what?
The wall lamp is Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
A wide circle surrounded by "molecules" of light provides as evenly and brightly as possible lighting of the space.
An "atomic" or "molecular" design that reflects the nature and nature of each subject does not lose its relevance and allows for beneficial interior accents.
One characteristic of such lamps is the weightlessness of the structure.
The thin, virtually invisible ropes, which are adjustable in height, make the chandelier feel like it's floating in the air.
Metal gold fittings and matto-white miniature pads will easily complement any palette, and the suspension chandelier and bras presented in the collection will become a ready ensemble for the living room, bedroom, hallway.
Well, it tastes and color, what it's called.
I really liked Tarhun, not the current one, of course.
The juices from the high glass cylinders were delicious.
Three rounds of syrup, too much for my taste.
Two was perfect.
Dimax Micro Ultimate, 160x190
Orthopaedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is comfortable with two different soft surfaces – high hardness and a little more medium.
The product includes only quality and bonus fillers, which have proved to be exclusively on the best side of the product.
Springs: An independent "micropacket" spring block is installed at the centre of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the sleeping room that work completely autonomously.
It's their operation that provides a unique point sub-structure.
Micropacket is the highest frequency of the whole variety of Dimax spring blocks and therefore has a distinct orthopaedic effect and is considered a bonus.
Fillers: combinations of coyre layers and natural latex are installed at the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the stoves.
If there's latex on one surface, there's coconut coyre on the other.
This type of filling machine has long been a classic one, as it transmits not only orthopaedic properties but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If the coyra provides the right back support, the latex adapts the surface to the human body.
Chehol: The model is supplied in a simple, knitted Aloe Vera covers.
If the client so wishes, it can be either filmed or fixed.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, and the recommended sleeper load is 170 kg.
Guarantee and security: Guarantee period - 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability of operation.
The orthopaedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, as reported by the Actual Camera on Sunday.
The purpose of the missions to be launched in five years is to assess the suitability for life of the clouds of Venus and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists offered tools for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the Venus clouds.
So far, the clouds of Venus, near the Earth of the planet, were supposed to be too acidic for life to exist there, but probably originally Venus was an Earth-like planet.
A sample from Venus should arrive during the third mission.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question is whether it looks earthly or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that earth’s life has not begun on earth.
If they are different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth,” said the head of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Michael Paiusala.

Metaves will change Russian business.
The subject of metaverses became popular in the autumn of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this was an important signal: the biggest player confirmed the development of a new format for digital interaction between people.
So business in Russia, like the rest of the world, will invest in creating its own metaverses and then monetizing them.
Metaves should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating remote interactions in a pandemic is that people are tired of disunity and limitations.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
With the third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, where all rights, securities, works of art and even money are digitized.
Anya, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you don't want anything too fat or too bad.
Of course, we're going to have traditional olives and herring under the coat, but no one makes me eat everything at once.
You can eat a spoon, you can taste it, and that's enough.
After all, there are ten days ahead of you, and you can make any delicious and useful dishes.

And she also realizes that four years before the next Olympiad, she's never gonna make it, that is, she's never gonna be an Olympic champion.
And someone who doesn't just play sports or can't imagine all the circles of hell she's gone through, don't go down with a conviction.
The British economist was unable to provide a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022, as he believed that such attempts would fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert is of the view that the next year will be full of uncertainty and that any trend may change turnover.
The most important factor was the coronavirus pandemic and, second, inflation, he believed.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in commodity prices was temporary or not.
According to the expert, even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of the infinite generosity of central banks is already out of date” and it is time to return to a relationship where inflation interest rates will be correlated with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that, in the context of the pandemic, the continuation of super-soft economic policies could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
Attention should also be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as to the increase in poverty and climate change, summarized by O'Neill.
Mikhail Shulgin, head of the Global Research Division, “Investing Opening”, previously reported that positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remained, with less growth potential.
Among the risks to the dollar’s value was the Fed’s monetary policy, oil price movements, and fears of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But the one thing that makes me happy is that when you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There's progress, just sluggish.
There is also a problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
All the eco-taxes that take the waste out of the house.
It's a cliché for recycling. Marginals use it.
It's rare to bring glass and metal in there.

Russians gave road dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
After 10 months in 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion roubles on new cars, an increase of 28 per cent over the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
In order to understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and the economy during the Coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of heads of countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In the Russian market, the Korean market is dominated by the Kia brand.
During the 10 months of this year, he was able to sell 325.7 billion roubles worth of cars, almost 24 per cent more than a year earlier.
Hyundai, a related Kia, has an even larger increase of more than 35 per cent, and the proceeds from the sale of cars are estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In leading positions, this brand and the increase in the weighted average price of the car - in the year for Hyundai it rose by almost 21 per cent, to 1.94 million roubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely, and Mercedes-Benz were more expensive.
However, sales of Korean brands have not increased as much: according to the statistics of the Car Producers Committee of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia sold 9.4 per cent more cars in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
Japan’s Toyota, which was used by Russians in 10 months, spent 275.5 billion roubles, 14 per cent more than a year earlier, to close the top three in monetary sales.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz, with 266.1 billion roubles (+75 per cent) - the German premium has both increased sales (37 per cent) and the weighted average price of the car (almost 28 per cent, to 8.2 million roubles).
"Mercedes-Benz both have good sales growth and a weighted average price -- more, for example, than BMW -- hence higher financial growth -- explained NAPI CEO Tatiana Arabaghi.
China’s brands, which have also significantly increased the financial capacity this year, are showing fantastic growth in sales.”
The Russian Lada shows an average of 28% in terms of income growth, and Russians spent 229.4 billion roubles on cars in 10 months.
At last year's level, the financial capacity of companies whose car sales fell in 2021, including Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
In 10 months, UAZ spent 12 billion roubles on SUVs and pickups, compared to 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
With problems in the supply of auto-components and production interruptions covering the entire world autoprochement, automobile companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same AutoWAZ increased the cost of the Lada models seven times a year, with the last upturn (by 8 to 10,000 roubles) taking place at the end of November.
Prices for their products and other car manufacturers are regularly rewritten.
The Russian car market will continue to grow in monetary terms – in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation makes its contribution to this, as well as the desire of motorists to pay back their past losses, experts consider.
In the face of a shortage of cars, I think that many cars have even been able to partly shift to the consumer the costs of past periods that they could not put in the price of cars earlier,
Says the U.S. capital analyst on Vladimir Bespalov's autopod.
I believe that, financially speaking, car manufacturers are feeling very well now, maintaining a high margin of sales."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of increase in the price of cars observed during 2021, and the price of new cars increases faster than inflation, as the expert points out.
In the long run, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly because of inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predict Besals.
As the supply increases, the possibilities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, Russian authors will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the price of cars slows down, car manufacturers will be able to earn their income from the volume, as noted by the independent automobile consultant Sergei Burgosliyev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now seeking the most profit from each car sold, noting Burgosliyev.
Increases in machine production are not expected in at least the next six months, and Russia's enthusiasm is also fuelled by uncertainty among citizens in the future.
Against the backdrop of the market situation, cars have proved to be a good investment destination - a car purchased a year ago, even with a runaway, can now be sold more than the original cost, says the expert.
Biden spoke of the transfer of U.S. military personnel to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion.
US leaders have never considered sending US military personnel to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion.
United States President Joe Biden made such a statement.
“There have never been such plans,” said the head of the White House, answering a journalist’s question as to whether the US has abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the US and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the US would move forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia).
“We will have to send more US and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9, all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia”, Biden said.
Earlier, Russian press spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow had no intention of trespassing on Ukraine.
He pointed out, however, that Moscow saw the problem in the military use of the drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
I'm leaving this interview right away.
If they're trying to get me to listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an unexplained burd and wash another cup, it's scary to imagine what's going to happen at work.
I'm gonna find myself a normal place, without the Eichron interlayer, where you're talking to the manager right away.

If a fraud called from a number like this, like a "M.I.D. officer" or some other power structure, it's not efficient to drop it immediately, and it's likely to be too late to blacklisted.
Because to confirm his lies about his involvement in the power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and persuade.
More useful recommendations are needed for the people.
That's bullshit.
I can't believe it was like this.

Assorty No. 2 wool set 100% merinos, 4x10 wool.
It was eight thousand years ago that wool was born as a trade, but it was very difficult to find wool in animals, much less colored.
But now voilà!
We're thinking of a little bit of natural wool to lay from a Russian manufacturer that doesn't have to be chased through the woods or pastures.
The unique properties of bouldering wool make it possible to produce bright and unique products.
For example, you can make a nice toy for yourself or your baby, an application for creativity, jewelry, interior decorations, and even clothing and accessories.
Imagine a pair of "stowed" furry sheep on your shelf, a little photo frame on the wall, a colorful necklace that looks great with a new dress, or a unique home slippers that no one's gonna have...
Put your ideas in the way of this wonderful wool!

I think I can even smile at you.
But I remember that thought is material!
