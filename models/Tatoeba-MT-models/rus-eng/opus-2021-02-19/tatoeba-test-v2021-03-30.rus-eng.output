Tom gave me money and advice.
What do you want me to say?
Please open the door.

She married him at the age of 20.
I can't give anyone that dictionary.
Hand me that box.

Take mine.
I know Tom's taller than Mary.
I didn't have time to do this today.

Do your kids know French?
Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
This soup is given by fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He talks about her too much.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to buy time.
I've already discussed it with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among men, spoke in the horrifying Galilee dialect of the Aramaic language instead of Hebrew, thus demonstrating the negation of claims of the existence of any sacred language, the use of which, in prayer, brings him closer to God.
In the end, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
Tom was paid $300 for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
The weather forecast wasn't wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll have Tom make you something to eat.
I'm gonna go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him singing in the shower.
You remind me of a young me.
Tom's on duty tonight.
I'm always busy.
I play a little piano.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom got up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in my room.
Rest is important.
Have you called Lucy yet?
Good idea came to her at the last minute.
There's a lot of air in this room.
Why aren't you wearing a sweater today?
A pound is a unit of weight.
I wouldn't talk to him again if I were you.
Japan consumes a lot of paper.
It's very difficult.
You betrayed me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems very busy.
And I'm very pleased to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help Tom.
Is that my book?
Washing's a routine job.
Who else is on your list?
Don't give Tom my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He reads physics in Oxford.
He kept it from me.
Did you save me?
He snored loudly in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom recognized Mary by voice.
You're not even looking at me.
Tom's too lazy to do this.
Please stop fighting.

Why aren't you here tomorrow?
We should get to know each other better.
Someone said something, but I didn't get it.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I never cared about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.
You sound upset.
Have you always been so selfish?
I think this cure will be of great use to you.
Tell Tom to be here by half past three.
It's not God's message. What science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
Would you like a beer?
Where'd you see him?
Poor cat was on the verge of starvation.
I've learned so much from my mistakes that I'm thinking of doing a few more!

I've made some corrections.

Come to me.

The bus was full.
Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I'm hungover.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car sells well.
I have to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words embarrassed me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom had to do.
Say hi to her for me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer was shocking.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I've got to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it at the store.
The world is cruel.
I'm having a sensitive dream.
He doesn't care about anyone but himself.
I'm from Shizuoka.
Tom cut down all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is the day he's free.
I wonder what happened to her.

He gave him a book.
Thank you so much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
I'm on my way.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm happy with what I've got.

Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom's yelling at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
I thought Tom said Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very perceptive.
Over and over again, there are obstacles in our lives, some call them problems, others talk about opportunities for growth.
Thanks for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
He told me he wanted out of the company.
Do you want to come in?
You and I both know that's not gonna happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need action, not words.

You're just running away from trouble.
A court without women is like a garden without flowers.
You can't leave the baby alone.
She'll do it if she can.
I'm done with this.
I put the bait on the hook.

Are you working tonight?
The wind's out.
I rarely met her.
I know it's really important.
I'm eating an apple.

This class doesn't have as tall as Bill.
Shall we go?
I knew I could count on you!
Tom put the wood in the fire.
"Love never killed anyone." "Is it true? Ask Romeo and Juliet."
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It's like an action of a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving yet?
Neither Tom nor Mary has ever been to Boston.
Have you ever sucked?
If I had money, I'd buy a computer.
Is Tom smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's at school now, right?
Please let us know.
Tom nodded and headed for the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove me wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Does it hurt anywhere?
He couldn't go because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how it works.
Open the door, or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think Tom can be trusted.
There's a lot of riddles in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's a rotten apple.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom's favorite city.
It's a shame when someone dies.
Are you feeling better?
What makes you think we might be interested?
I'll think of you every day while I'm gone.
That was a bad bet.
The thought of her going alone was bothering me.
The river flows in size.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I've been watching them.
Do you really love her?
He gave an account of the facts without comment.
It was dark green.
He's definitely coming.
You got a message?
I got a call from Tom yesterday.
We really need this.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I've decided to give up.
The accident took their only son.
Everyone knows there's something new in this old capital.
I'm always careful.
I went to the market.

Tell Tom I have his keys.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Do we have a chance to win?

She doesn't like the way I talk.
Mary wants another baby.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.

How's your father?
Did they say when?
This car looks angry.
Do you study English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money for a new dress.
Why is the moon glowing at night?
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.
You won't be needing this anymore.
Tom did it on purpose.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do this.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Do you know everyone here?
Tom couldn't read until he was 13.
I prefer quail eggs.
She lives in Muhosransk.
Those people who aren't smarter than me, I'm not interested.
Is this your first time in Australia?
The owls are wise.
Tom asked for some water.
The loser had a break in all three networks he had given him.

I have an errand for Tom.
"How did the accident happen?" "Nobody knows."
What do you like about him?
When I got to the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.
Tom got rid of his foreign accent.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
No one disagreed.
She's running.
It's a man.
If it were Icelandic, I think it would be white.
Do you know where the meeting is going?
I wish they were happy.
I want to get off the job.
Christianity has many followers.
The mats absorb the sound.
Tom told me it was impossible.
This must be where Tom lives.
Tom's a weird kid.

I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you work hard.
I love Ural languages.
I hope you're wrong about that.
Sometimes you have to tell the truth.
Tom's a pusher.
I have a proposition for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning on getting married on October 20.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
He's got a lot of talent.
He's in a bad mood.
How would you like to be called?
His father is Japanese.
Who would want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was exhausted.
He's in school till late at night.
Tom's room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we know.
I'm proud of him.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his oven.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We have to be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom threw Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't help laughing at her jokes.
By means of the prophet Zechariah, God made the confluence of kingship and priesthood in Jesus Christ.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Each of us went to his house.
It's thin, but it's not strong.
It's all a little silly.
I don't know what I want right now.
It's incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six-five for TV viewers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom is interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really that bad?
Tell me where you'll live, please.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I was ugly.
Do you cry a lot?
We did not expect such results.
I've read it before.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Did you find anything interesting?
Everybody's doing it.
I visit my family a lot.
He'll be expelled from our club.
You should be punished for what you did.
They went up the stairs.
She has to drink water.
It's one of the ugliest buildings I've ever seen.
The robber broke into the post office in broad daylight.
That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My desk's old.
We're both very busy.
The darkness is unsightly.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll pick you up.
Tom tried to drown himself in the tub.
Tom and I are the same size.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Mary’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
It's a big book.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I thought I made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Times can change, but human nature is still the same.
Tom seems pretty upset.
I brought cookies.
Next year, Tom will be teaching French.
I've listened to her to the end.
I told Tom to rest.
Why does that make you angry?
The worst part of the trip is over.
We'll miss you both.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
Don't you speak French?
How dare you do that!
I really needed this knife.
How do you know what I had?
It'll only take you a minute.
That's a situation I'd really like to change.
We took care of everything.
I used to be really fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to trust any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a squirrel in a wheel.
He never got over it.
Would you like to come with us?
Does Tom know how to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We're planning on leaving as soon as possible.
He went skiing on Hokkaido.
"Shut your fucking music and read the book." "I see my censorship spell still works!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed it with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no escape for her.
I'm sorry I did this without you.
You're bleeding out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the supermarket around here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like that.
Even if you do, join us.
Tom wanted to apologize to Mary again.
Tom was thinking.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He was never there.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't gonna do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Hurry up or you'll be late for school.
Did you ever write a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary switched places.
How do they get you out?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful man, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at risk.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
That decision was hard to make.
I thought you were thirsty.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
Tom didn't have to leave.
Mary recovered from her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Eating meat is harmful to your health and the environment.
Are you telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom can't enjoy life.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
Nobody loves me.
I wish I knew Tom's phone.
"Tom knows." "Yeah, did you tell him?" "No, he found out himself."
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you were just thinking something dirty.
Sugar is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like most about Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for a signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We've got a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is the weeping willow.
I don't have that book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun lies at the center of the solar system.
Are you a cop?
Tom let me down, and so did Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut myself with a razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river irrigated the garden.
The strong wind is quiet at night.
Ants and giraffes are distant relatives.
Tom did it because I told him so.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom was carrying two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to recognize me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just got off the phone with your teacher.
I'm used to sleeping early.
Do you really think I wouldn't have helped you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the best pears I've ever eaten.
I had a parking problem.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
She's not mine.
Do you know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom was never late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
Do you still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each sheet.
You're hard to take seriously.
The members of the tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When's the start?
Nobody cares what she thinks.
I don't think that's weird at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave it to me."
When are you going to clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does it make sense to fix it?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he tried it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You don't know how to write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's short, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Please find Tom.
He'll give it to you.
That sentence is not clear.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
Don't you understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This box weighs a ton.
He gets everything because he's an asshole.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
He seemed to be going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
I don't think that's gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
Yesterday I was free all day, and today I'm working.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a terrible man!
Carton's stronger than paper.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your authority.
The curse was broken.
Tom's great-grandfather was born blind.
Tom's taller than you, isn't he?
She hurt her back playing tennis.
Tom's easily scared.
This table is white.
It was a strange game.
I've heard of all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going to Boston with you.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer, they went to a mountain resort.
Do you have any idea where the nearest church is?
Stay out of there.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What do you expect Tom to do?
She seemed perfectly calm.
Press the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what was happening.
Mary wore boots to her knee.
That's a lie.
I'll keep an eye on them.
She said she had a cold.
The traffic inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to follow in his father's footsteps.
I don't see a problem here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's terribly bitter.
Did Tom tell you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Last time, Tom was the first.
They're all different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put a tree over there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom's gonna fix this.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
My mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Small pots have long arms.
Tom was in sandals.
There's a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
What do you think of my story?
Tom turned off his alarm and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you singing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom plays guitar a lot.
I tried to warn Tom.
The train was full.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he's not planning to go.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
Does Tom have a cable?
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for his help.
Tom could have told me.
It'll be bad luck for your family.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I had to go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You need to try to stay awake.
Mom's been very helpful to me.
Tom has a snake tattooed on his back.
You bought meat at the supermarket?
He hit me by mistake.
What's the dog's name?
Walk the sidewalk.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's father is.
It's raining like a bucket.
The whole country's talking about it.
I can't wait to tell him.
You can't buy happiness.

There's a cat on the table.
Tom says he doesn't want to go to Australia with me.
I came, I saw, I won.
Life isn't always fair.
I saw Tom take your keys.
The whole night was ruined by a fight between Tom and Mary.
Can you read it?
We need more farmers.
Tell us more about your trip.
Six degrees below zero.
I don't expect you to believe that.
We've seen a lot of unusual plants in the botanical garden.
Sometimes a small gift can be an expression of great love.
Do you prefer blondes or brunettes?
I didn't get on the bus.
Tom didn't like the movie.
You want us to help you?
Be realistic.
Tom was planning a party.
I'll get someone to help.
Why didn't you tell us this before?
Is that Chinese or Japanese?
Fire.
I'm making progress.
You're pale as a ghost.
I'll be home by 6:00.
French isn't that complicated.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was gray.
Tom never missed school.
I suggest you do it today.
I'm not going to marry her.
Tom drinks apple juice.
You're taking the train?
That's what we think.
How could something like this happen?
You're actresses.
Tom was mentally ill.
I forgot to ask.
My hands and feet are always freezing.
How do you translate words that are not in any language other than mine?
Could you tie this with a tape?
I'm going home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.
We're stuck in traffic.
Tom's really mad at me.
I used to wash my head once a week.
Eleven is a simple number.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Coffee's on me.
We're husband and wife.
The Jacksons invited us to dinner tonight.
Tom was impartial.
The leaves begin to fall in October.

What saddens you?
I'm too busy to talk to you right now.

Where did you put the screwdriver?

Praise be to Allah!
You think Tom knows?
I'm paying this time.
Tom was acting like a kid.
Stop singing.
Only six people came to the party.
What did you decide?
I didn't know you were romantic.
I saw you spying on Tom.
I need you to do it now.
The robber walked into the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
Mary's boy's name is Tom.
I'm afraid there's something I need to confess.
Tom was supposed to be there yesterday.
Tom was an important man.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Tehran.
"Do you speak Greek?" "Not yet, this is my first lesson!"
Why did you give him the money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
Did you go to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis last night.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you talk her into it?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll do our best.
Would you buy one of these?
Tom's gonna miss the plane.
She's always up early.
You want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the middle of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy at that store?
When do we have a woman president?
He came looking forward to seeing you.
I'm glad Tom did.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is near our school.
I made these cookies for you.
England is like Japan in many ways.
Tom would never do that.
I suggest you try harder.
That dog's not gonna scare the baby.
Don't fight it.
Tom has the keys.
When I'm in a bad mood, I like to think about the miners to cheer myself up.
How would you feel if someone did that to you?
We're both very sleepy.
Tom just can't do whatever he wants.
Tom doesn't often tell us jokes.
Onions can be used in many dishes.
There's hardly any snow here.
I asked Tom to help us.
Lightning struck the tree.
Do you speak English?
My brother will kill me.
I opened the gate.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it difficult to learn Greek?
Tom's coming with you?
Where's the remote control?
I can't find her either.
You'll speak Swedish.
Did you see anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't hang up.
Tell Tom not to get caught in the eye.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
You want to work with them?
It was an interesting movie.
I'm exhausted, I work from morning to evening.
What time are we leaving?
It's a fake.
Tom is very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What's going to happen to Tom?
I hope you don't catch a cold.
He's aiming at the bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Oh, come on!
I've got to keep going.
She stuck her nose against the glass.
The verbs ser and estar do not differ in English.
I know exactly what I'm gonna do.
He's very secretive.
You have excellent English.
Any messages for me?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing SMS while driving is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The skull of the pitchfork was broken.
Why don't you go kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Thomas to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he should tell me.
I was very calm.
Everyone's got something to hide.
We'll have some guests tonight.
Her voice's still ringing in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time heals everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son's a genius.
Don't miss the occasion.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds didn't fly.
What more do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you?
I told Tom you came to Australia.
Is that what you're looking for?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where should I wait for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were caught in a snowstorm.
The book is on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What do we have to lose?
You better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Did Tom tell you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered his letter.
I hired someone today.
Stop fooling around!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'll take the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me that's not how Mary does it.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've already done it.
What's the weather like?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Aren't you gonna introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told Tom that Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living out of town?
How long did it take you?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's supervisor.
Who are you planning on going to Australia with?
Someone was screaming.
Which one's better?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell Tom to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train leaves at 3:30.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the animals from the cage.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like your father.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please watch this movie.
Someone's calling.
I'm out of here.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't look at your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're way taller than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on having a son.
Mary says she needs more time.
Thomas walked away from the door.
My dad's an English teacher.
For Christmas, Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bicycle.
Hold on to the railing.
Did you do that?
I'd like you to translate this into French.
How many glasses are on the table?
The lawyer has convincing evidence that she's innocent.
Maybe.
I don't love Tom anymore.
Who's Tom with?
Taro has a strong sense of responsibility.
We both saw him.
We have to help.
Tom just got out of prison.
Did you tell Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I made a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
It is only in philosophy that the vicious circle of evidence can be used and praised.
I can't afford to have children.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and they couldn't get these idiots to understand their own language.
Should I go?
I was stupid enough to believe it.
She really did it.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll get it.
My mother must be angry.
White bread, please.
The owls are cute.
Tom's illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're perfect for each other.
French is complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger's over.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was annoyed.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Is Paris far?
What time is it in Tokyo?
He said he hoped to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming today.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take off your shoes?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it'll snow this year for Christmas?
How was Tom's party?
I have to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me just as well.
I'd like a coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth at all lately.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't get a second chance like this.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
I have to pay all the bills.
She clapped.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's dragging Mary by her hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a firefighter.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he liked it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the laziest person I know.
Did Mary clean her room yet?
I'll forgive him this time.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a sober man.
Alvaro from Venezuela, he's Venezuelan.
Here's the bill.
He insulted me in public.
Tom won't win anymore.
Why don't I stay with you?
In induction plates, magnets are used to heat pans and pans directly.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn how to play a trombone.
Come out now.
Can I see your license?
I'll charge you 1,000 pesetas to replace the lightning on those jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom still lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom made pancakes.
He dictated some letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you wearing pajamas?
How much does it cost?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
The rice cup weighs about 180 grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom since half past three.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's kind.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
The infection's in the bloodstream.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me.
Tom watches TV sometimes.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I'm still not thinking straight.
Run, chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
I'm sick of you!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current state of affairs.
I know what you told her.
I didn't fall asleep until two in the morning.
Mary was not thirsty.
Tom wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say that movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
Apparently, she's healthy.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Keep an eye on your brother.
Tom said he wasn't gonna wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter peppers.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I put milk in the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There's no such thing as invincible.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can draw.
They're dirty.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
A man was sentenced to death.
Was it snowing yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you measure it?
Does Tom know French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to go.
We didn't talk about it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defense.
How does faith differ from trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather allows, we'll climb the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both know each other.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more complicated it seemed.
His gray eyes glittered and sparkled, and his usually pale face was revived and covered with roman.
What kind of pizza do you like most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take some more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were blue because of the cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed a lot of houses.
This man was condemned to death.
Call me as soon as you see him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you wearing my shoes?
Power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to practice and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's gonna blame you.
I'm not at all busy right now.
Children like to play more than learn.
They thought he was his little brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
Did the moustache suddenly come into fashion?
Tom said he didn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born the day before yesterday.
Tom's wearing a pirate suit.
That's the truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did the best I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why wasn't I asked?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll help you out.
We are proud of our achievement.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop hitting the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is who he says he is?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald Sinezuby, introduced Christianity in Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go into this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Hesse.
To tell you the truth, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases come to trial, it is generally accepted that there should be 12 persons on the jury.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian embassy?
Tom and I started seeing each other.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was gonna do it.
It's been another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, hurry up, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's is a world-famous hamburger.
Tom gave Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have an opinion?
Do you like those perfumes?
The lock's broken.
The diamond is a precious stone.
Have some cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stand down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How'd you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want what's best.
Tom's a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was it too easy?
What Alice faced in the wait for an answer was a sudden war, and it was a loud noise, so sharp as to tear her eardrums apart, and so loud as to reach the sky.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
Tom can't go in there.
Tom helped Mary get her stuff in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom was reluctant to give Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You were supposed to do your homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That stone was so heavy I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
She'll respond to it as soon as she hits it.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever had a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the kids?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed a tree.
The language I'm teaching is very complicated.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president has been ruling for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Would you mind solving that?
Tom and Mary are both here.
Why would Tom do that?
Twenty floors in the building.
If you're not coming, I'm not going either.
You don't happen to know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a bit?
You're gonna give Tom something for Christmas?
She's not gonna fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
Next month, I'll be very busy.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he'd be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There's a strong wind coming up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you do.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag's empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn as a donkey.
I think we can rely on you.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling Mary was bringing her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom spoke in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say it again!
I called him, but some girl answered.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom's very hard on the kids.
How's the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom might be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got a little moustache.
Do you understand what she said?
You seem distracted.
Don't make her angry.
I'd rather stay.
Tom came up with a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place safe?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect Tom should go to Boston next week.
Don't walk on other people's land.
Tom was terrified to watch.
Tom's face is blushing.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where are you and Tom staying?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done here.
How do you like your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the gym.
Can you stay with them?
Tom's home early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to talk to you about something important for both of us.
We need to get you to a hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it often.
I hope we don't do this again.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, it's opening time.
I'm not sure what her size is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help but think about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire him?
He and I were crying.
Would you like to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you dressed like that?
You can make butter, cheese, and so on from milk.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know that Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
Have you thought about asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one's hungry but me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflake in the snow avalanche feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?

Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?

Let's see something else.
Do you think this is an exact translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We were both really hungry.
Tom has nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You have to take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
Tom started to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you're tired, you're asleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I have to move on.

I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom knocked him off his feet.
Tom tried to stop Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to study more.

I meet new people every day.
I want to go on a date with him.
You let Tom down.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss Tom terribly.
He answered his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I held him by the collar.
No one's asking you to do this.
I forgot it was April 1st.
Please stop singing that song!
Tom was bitten by a dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I'm aware of the consequences.
The river divides the eastern and western parts of the city.
Why are you jumping?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
Was Tom scared?
Tom asked me to stay the night.
I don't think Tom's guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed with your French.
We both want to do it.
If you warm up the ice, it melts.
We could have done it.
The doctor said Tom needs surgery.
I just changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
This is your bedroom.
Tom is realistic.
Who knocks on my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I've come to see you.
I feel like an amoeba.
Our team came home in triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married the older girl.
I listened to him.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do it!
Everybody's quiet.
Let the dust settle.
Why are you so stubborn?

My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom cooks better than I do.
He swims like an axe.
Tom didn't tell Mary what he needed to buy.
She brought a broom.
"Tom, hurry up." "I'm coming!"

We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'll try to say it in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to brag about his father's successful automobile business.
She's wearing sunglasses.
Come on, Emilia, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of the computer?
Tom can barely walk.

There's a dead body in the basement.
Please donate.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to tell.

They're great.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane's farewell speech really saddened us.
I try not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look mind-blowing.
I appreciate your help.
He couldn't help it.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is learning that you didn't even know you didn't.

You should have thought it over before you got her pregnant.

I caught two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's pale.

Interview's over.
Please turn off the radio.
He seemed unsure of his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if it's warm.
There's so many of them.
He couldn't compromise the principles.
Mary says she's single.
It'll probably take you three hours.
It was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd be home early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
You still buying lottery tickets?
Anyone can do that.
A single language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is gifted with a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
It's all about telling the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
There was nothing wrong with my mind.

It's not cold today.
I'm wearing Tom's shirt by mistake.
Looks like the bank robbery was planned to go through the details.
Tom didn't like it, but he still bought it.
Stay a while.
I want to talk to you about something.
The jar's empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to pick up the phone.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, isn't he?
Don't make me kill you!
Which one do you like better, this one or that one?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't make us angry.
You don't have to answer that.
Tom has a lot of books.
Can you tell the difference between an alligator and a crocodile?
Wait, what's that?
My grandfather built this house.
Do you want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a kid.
You really want me to tell Tom that you killed his father?
I got a call from your teacher.
I'm your father.
Can I do it?
All the people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous this is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
Okay, everybody, listen, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
I'm sorry!
I think Tom is my friend.
In the hope of remaining ignorant and free, the nation is counting on something that has never happened and will never happen.
Tom's barely breathing.

Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are loyal animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Does Tom know you can't speak French?
There are two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna tell you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than in bad company.
That's the wrong data.
There is a marked difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom's lazy.
We need to tell Tom not to do this again.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's pretending.
Come closer.
We're staying at the Hilton Hotel.
You should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She was always complaining that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something has to be done.
She gave him a gift.
Mary's in her room.
Attention, everyone!
That's the second I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order this pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom is a close friend of mine.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't have walked into the woods alone.
No one can see my tears.
Tom overslept again.
She really likes you.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are multiple.
Tom's never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you stopped by.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't do it.

I don't think they heard us.

Honesty is one of the virtues.
You'll have a new year, and you'll have one.
The library doesn't have any books in French.
Any generalization is dangerous, especially this.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write that hiragana, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you like I do.
Act like you're old.
Can you juggle?
Did you kill your wife?

I think Tom's right.
It's sad here.
Do you see a star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
You said that a lot yourself.

It's always been that way.
Can't we fire her?

He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry for Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
I.D.'s on the desk.
I'm sure Tom didn't know that.
Tom didn't tell us why he was so upset.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know that better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You have nothing to hide, do you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The bill has to be paid by the first day of next month.
My French is terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not like Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an attempted extortion.
I can't speak for colleagues.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The argument ended in a fight.
I didn't take it.
Tom came in yesterday.
I'd like to give you a review.
You picked the wrong man.
They took great risks.
We have a white cat.
You may never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.

Your problem is you lack patience.
Several events marked the advance of the twenty-first century.
Stop doing that, Tom.
Tom said he wasn't planning on doing it.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told Tom to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said it was out of the question.
He got out of bed.
Trains are on schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are a lot of people who think it's impossible to avoid being confused with languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Will the exam be today?
What motivates you?
He gave Leila his computer.
Roll up your sleeves.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom would agree to meet us?
They say that anyone in America can be president, but I guess that's not true.
Tom never forgot Mary.
First on the list is Tom's name.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
What time does the train arrive?
What time does this train arrive in Boston?
You didn't see that?
You need to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John were seeing each other.
When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I made him cookies.
It's a neighboring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You're not gonna believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Can you translate this into French, please?
Have some cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd grew rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me what happened.
Kosi and beat it.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She's loved by everyone.
Compare your answers with those of Tom.
Tom has a weak heart.
Tom's gonna have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took his beard off.
Have you seen my dog?
Don't even try to do it on your own.
No one saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix her.
You have to come back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally made it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, it's an easy test.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know which book to pick.
Tom didn't understand at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
It's a tower.
I'll have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Does anyone here know them?
They're watching you.
How long do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows his flaws.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's wearing a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks anyone for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of wide prospectus in this town.
What the hell are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's no stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't force people to do this.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I hate that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still single.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
The neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She's got some flaws.
I wonder why Tom would do that.
It seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom's not the only one here from Boston.
Will you back me up?
What's your problem with this plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter will soon be over.
Titles and awards mean nothing to me.
Where did you even find him?
It's been a long time.
I recognize you.
Did you have a good day off?
Tom's drinking beer.
If you don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Get Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Concentrate!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we'll get lost.
I can't call him at home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy fled to his home.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom seems optimistic.
He's not gonna buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I'll put you through to her.
She's got the highest grades.
Tom can grow up.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you associate your childhood with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom used the floor jack.
I'd like to lie down.
Lend me notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight, I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here today.
Cat's dead.
It's only half past nine?
Tom went to the store to buy some milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's not safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me tonight.
Tom doesn't look good.
She blew it on her hands to keep them warm.
Tom said he's glad you're back.
My car's covered in pigeon shit.
Tom doesn't know I exist.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Is Lori home?
I've decided to marry Tom.
I won't make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I talked her into marrying him.
I've waited my whole life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane went into the corkscrew.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any pen pals in Indonesia?
You might have to help her.
Mary passed out.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come to the concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read that book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hello," Tom said timidly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
They're running.
The road doesn't match the number of cars that pass through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any other questions?
A new offer as a message in a bottle: one day it'll be translated.
You're not gonna get a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
We're soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started studying in her new office.
Let us take care of it.
I assume you're sitting in my seat.
I was planning on doing it yesterday.
It's a little early to drink alcohol, isn't it?
My parents don't like the way I dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him skillfully and hard.
What's worse?
It's cheap.
Can I hold your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom stayed up all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulite.
You have to start watching the series when all seasons have been filmed!
Road traffic accidents occur every day.
Where did you go skiing?
Were you at the hairdresser's?
The prospect is bleak.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ball handle.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in 48 hours.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Get lost.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed on the exam.
Everyone already knew that.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
Are they coming, too?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom forgot to release the brakes.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion rocked the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged.
That's my cat.
Do you have children yet?
Tom didn't want breakfast.
Tom likes them.
Tom doesn't even know why he got expelled from school.
Tom is a presumptuous idiot.
It keeps me up at night.
He's been transferred to another department.
I guess you need some help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks it's a sin to throw away food.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about this yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I'm sure you will.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom wiped the whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's responding.
That's the nicest thing I've ever met.
How much was it worth?
I need to see you immediately.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.
Do you know that boy crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do it.
The man who stole the pin steals the cow.
Tom's not a very good swimmer, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just a shadow of himself.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come to Boston with us next week.
Don't let them in.
Things happen.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm just a guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily on the lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom never said he was coming with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I should stick together.
I've only heard good things about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't match us.
I saw the car explode.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Hold still!
What's your favorite TV show?
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I'm going back to Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog's yours.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm gonna go to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer has given his men courage.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying something like this right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
It's the first time I've made grilled meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why would they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone knew that already.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe that's what she said.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw the way he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was who I thought she was.
Tom showed the police officer his driver's license.
I cut my hair every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's a sour apple.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go fishing too.
You're taking your job home?
According to mythology, Prometheus has stolen sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All the passengers managed to get out of the bus before it caught fire.
I want to help you deal with this.
You speak French better than I do.
There's a lot of talented people in this town, but Tom doesn't belong to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars were shining in the night sky.
I doubt Tom's gonna win.
“Ah, you're so bored here.” — “My boy, this world is for everyone...” — “Here I am! Your Majesty, Ganon and his minions have taken the island of Cordai.” — “Hmm. What can we do?” “As it is written, only Link can defeat Ganon.” “So we can do.” — “How can we get my sword?” — “I will take my sword!” — “Am I not?” — “There is no place!” — “...” — “This is an axe with a skull.” — “No” — “How about “Ah, father” acopia?” — “No” — “How about smoke bombs?” — “No” — “Oh, hell, how do you like this gun?”
Do you know who sings this song?
Is your watch going right?
I'll see you Sunday at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're good at it.
I met her on the way home from school.
I haven't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn to read.
I'm going to Tom's house.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed money.
Tom helped Mary pack the blankets.
A is a set consisting of elements (c), (b) and (a).
I'll be back by 9:00.
He's diabetic.
We can deal with them.
I was just wondering if you had any experience you wanted to share with us.
Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music are you listening to in the car?
I was told that three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French revolution began under Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim at sea.
It'll be entirely up to him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our town was covered with smog.
No one saw them leave the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We were talking about you.

I'm sure Tom would be happy to help.
It's Joanna.
I've made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
Tom's really sorry.
I like your glasses.
Rain water flows through this pipe.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm one of those girls who's more friends with guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
It's hard for my father to quit drinking.
No one's suggesting you do this.
He works for this company from Monday to Sunday.
Mary forgot to lock the car.
I'm old.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic powers.
Who is he by nationality?
Tom was in the same cell with John.
I didn't want to swim.
He's drunk.
It's hard for a man to be... himself these days.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, wake Tom up!
I'll iron my handkerchiefs.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm the new teacher.
They're all kids.
She got mad and yelled at me.
Have you taken your medication?
The rabbits are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time is on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt Tom's still angry.
You'll feel better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell burning rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When's your father coming home?
I understand.
Tom gave Mary the book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.
Tom has a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom will try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's dying.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair is sweaty.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it weighs?
The flight attendant is a master of compliments.
Tom's married to Mary, isn't he?
All the benches in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
It's working for me.
Vermont is located on the border with Canada.
He had to live in the same room as his brother.
I'm not imbecile.

Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I already talked to this student.
What chemical mark is methyl hydrogen acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
Tom needs to talk to his lawyer.
I think you should do it.
Cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed as a janitor.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
The skyblock is in the middle of town.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine, call cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You're not using it, are you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
How long are you planning on staying?
We ate quickly and left immediately.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you ever call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The calica was open.
I brought you some wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I'm dying to meet you.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
The apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about that.
She sings?
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's take the car.
You're in my way.
She was wondering what his lips would taste like.
A good coach trains this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was delayed by heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing it or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday party.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
Last year, she learned how to ride a bike.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Because it was winter, he didn't go outside.
Walking down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses on your street?
The elephant tusks are made of ivory.
I'm not a child anymore.
"What's up, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
Her mother tongue is French.
It's not a uniform coat.
She stopped for a smoke.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naiveness is his only positive quality.
My hobby is the collection of insects.
Tom lived as a child in Boston.
I haven't eaten in six days.
Can I tell them that?
She's been quiet all day.
No matter what he says, don't trust him.
I've moved on.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very nice, and she's got a nice smile.
I'm not gonna let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under the lullaby.
This is the best restaurant I know.
You could learn a lot from them if you only listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry I upset you.
He who has never left his country is full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I turned on the imagination.
I thought we could do this.
My mom didn't want me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
You know what you're doing, right?
You can't trust a machine transfer.
She hit me, not him.
You wouldn't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There's plenty of fish in this river.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're the same age as her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
The prisoner is released.
What did they say happened?
Could you leave the door open?
It'll have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows what he did was a mistake.
In Japan, the climate is soft.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced the injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip was very smooth.
It's inevitable that I'm going to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's just pretending to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
It stopped raining, we can open the windows again.
It's never happened to me before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was gonna come out when my phone rang.
I don't have to take it.
Always give way to the interference on the right.
We're being asked to introduce ourselves one at a time.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a lift if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing's as relaxing as a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about that.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a melody siren song to me.
How does it feel to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left prints on the glass.
Chemistry is a wonderful science.
I feel like my French isn't getting much better.
How am I supposed to get a passport?
Maybe you can help Tom.

I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom's been ignoring Mary all day.
Tom has fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
It's still light out there.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but soon it'll be mine.
Have you forgotten his name?
If I had time to do this, I would.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Is it a big Thomas?
This medicine will help you.
Stop making noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I've been?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I don't have anyone to trust.
She's a fan of Sex in the City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long working day.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will it take you?
Let's take a break here.
Are you wearing new shoes?
You can leave if you want.

That's what my mom used to say.
She was making makeup when she saw the dog.
He's no taller than me.

I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the pitcher up.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What do we live for?
Will it rain this afternoon?
We know about her.
You could've helped us.
I don't drive often.
Tom doesn't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just ask him for forgiveness.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
You two make me sick.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventure.
Tom's in the library.
Were you at school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who that was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.

He came up and got on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.

No one seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.

Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told Tom to leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?

Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
Things are getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.

She's undressed.
I'm not gonna let you take my kids.
Don't give it to him.
Run or you'll be arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made it a rule to meditate every morning.
Did you check your calculations?

A room without books like a body without a soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What does your brother do?
We need a volunteer.
What makes Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in ages.

I've been tearing seeds all day.
The accent made me realize he was American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Have mercy!

"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American political scientist."
Get out of here!
If it's not a home sale, then maybe it's a new way to meet girls.

Why didn't you clean your room?
If there's no God, everything's allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I should have married him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't make fun of them.
Please fasten your seat belts during take-off and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've been waiting a long time for this.
I declined the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
It'll take me too long to explain why it won't work.
Nothing's changed.
You built all this yourself?
I'm looking forward to a summer vacation.
Can we spell it differently?
It looks great from here.
Wooden houses are easily ignited.
Let's throw Tom a party.
The dog's still alive.
I go to university.
I know you lied.
The bed is very comfortable.
I'll report on it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a slut.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for him to come.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think this through.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do this without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who set up the meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix this.
I'm not going to have any fun tonight.

He's prone to be emotional.
We were shocked to learn of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You're just saying the obvious.
He had cancer.
It's your fault it happened.
It's as precise as clockwork.
I know where you're going.
You're taking everything for granted.
Let's move him.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he's telling us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaning lady interrupted the conversation.
There's a cat on the desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not limping anymore.
Tom was a heavy smoker.
Tom's wearing gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to this weather.
I'm wondering who's gonna help him decorate the snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in soul mates?
What's that noise?
My son has a hereditary disease.
It's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He lowered the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is assault.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Is there anything we can do for you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live in rice and fish.
When will you be ready to go?
Investigations began last year with the confiscation of the computer archives of a man from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's it going?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What makes you think you can't?
We were driving back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe this?
Thank you for your correction.
Are you crazy?
Stars show up at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's sharpening his pencil.
Tom can't ride a bike.
I don't speak at all on the body.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 in one day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They didn't make it on time.
It's 7:30.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who told Tom.
Tom got up early to see the dawn.
Dinosaurs died out a long time ago.

Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Tom's brother?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
Today, I'm out of my hands.
I asked them to stay out of it.
Tom only learned how to drive in his 30s.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife wasn't sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my penknife.
Honey, I can explain.
You're about to adjust to village life.
Keep the bucket next to the water.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
It's the deepest river here.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I've told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing words separately when they have to write syllables is a big problem in Norwegian.

We left soon after that.
It's a book worth reading.

I like to learn other languages.
Mary has brown eyes.
I'd like to know how long Tom plans to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like fruit.
Tom lied.
He sells cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate caviar.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check it out.
Tom gave me Mary's gun.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They got on the bus first.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anyone here know them?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford a vacation.
I'm used to the smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you what time to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship has remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get to the point.
Tom was sitting on the stairs.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning strikes twice in the same place.
I'm not bragging.
Save it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door unlocked.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
It's up to you.
Were you surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree that we cut down, and we determined that he was thirty years old.
I think I've known you my whole life.
I want Tom to never write to my daughter again.
Rabbits reproduce quickly.

I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You don't tell me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left last.
Tom signed the petition.
