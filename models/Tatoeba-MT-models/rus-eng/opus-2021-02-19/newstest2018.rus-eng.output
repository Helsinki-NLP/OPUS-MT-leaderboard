Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law introducing administrative liability for violating the time and procedure for payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for State and municipal needs.
The purpose of the Act is to address the very acute problem of the failure of customers to comply with their obligations in public and municipal procurement.
As early as two years ago, it was common for entrepreneurs to be unable to obtain payment under public and municipal contracts already executed.
At the same time, the President of the Russian Federation instructed the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because businessmen themselves were unable to deal with unscrupulous customers who entered into unfunded contracts, tried their best to avoid payment obligations and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in general in the country.
Since 2015, in order to protect the right of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has submitted 9,700 submissions, disciplinary proceedings have been brought against 4,500 officials, administrative proceedings have been instituted against 533 officials, and criminal proceedings have been instituted against 46 of them.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
These huge amounts were not accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs, far more modest amounts, have led to huge debts.
Here's a special case.
The head of a small company won a multi-million ruble social transport competition.
The man invested all his working capital, fully discharged his obligations, but did not receive the money on time.
The result is an increasing financial pool of debt on wages, taxes, loans that would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought the assistance of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The problem has now been minimized in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total debt on State and municipal contracts, as identified by the procurators of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to approximately 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical levels, the Office of the Public Prosecutor operates under a manual crisis management regime.
The Attorney-General personally holds mobile meetings with the local authorities, at which all violations discovered by the prosecutors are dealt with in a meaningful manner and measures are taken to remedy them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already taken place this year in Yaroslav and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ “On amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with regard to the establishment of administrative liability of the officials of the employer for violation of the time and procedure for payment of goods (work, services) in procurement to meet State and municipal needs”, signed last week by the President of Russia, will improve the payment discipline of public customers in a qualitative manner.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Development of Russia on the initiative of the Office of the Procurator-General.
The new law would supplement the Code of Administrative Offences with an article providing for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for the violation by an official of the employer of the time limit and the procedure for paying goods, work and services in State and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been subjected to an administrative penalty for a similar offence, he or she will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All procurators of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure that these legislative innovations are implemented in practice.
Civil Rights Unit has issued a warning on movement to Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads as follows: “The warning to travellers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, valid until 28 August 2017, calls upon African American travellers, visitors and citizens of the state of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to exercise great caution when travelling in the state in connection with a number of suspicious racist incidents that have recently taken place throughout the state and that have taken place here.”
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the recent Missouri law, which made it more difficult for people to win claims of discrimination, led to the fact that State law enforcement agencies disproportionately target minority groups.
“In your people, human rights are violated.
They are stopped on the roads because of their colour, beaten and killed,” says the newspaper Cansas City Star, Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri.
“We hear complaints more often than ever.”
This is the first warning of its kind announced by the organization vis-à-vis the U.S. state.
The Panel referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of Tori Sanders, a twenty-eight-year-old man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas on a trip to the state, and the Missouri state police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report from the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, according to which black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
“The purpose of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be trained in one way or another to take the bail money with them or to inform their relatives that they are travelling across state territory.”
According to the latest FBI hate crime reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes recorded in Missouri in 2015, making the state the sixteenth largest hate crime in the state.
The travel notice is also a response to the new Missouri law, which will make it more difficult to bring a case against a legal person for housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued warnings to travellers in Texas and Arizona after those states had enacted new immigration control laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration offences, which ACLU believed would increase the number of racial audits.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but more recently, public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Two people were killed by shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown gunmen fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reporting Reuters, citing the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the exchange of fire, two people, including one policeman, were killed and three were injured.
All wounded have been taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the vehicle, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement personnel.
One of the intruders has been apprehended, the other managed to escape.
Rostour supports the law on the elimination of free baggage for non-return airline tickets
The head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview with the RBC television channel that he was “positive” about the adoption of a law to abolish the free shipment of baggage on non-return airline tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage”, he stressed (quota from TASS).
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that despite citizens ' concerns, there would be no need to pay for the carriage of clothing and a mobile phone in the hand baggage.
“It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to say it, to say it's to the top of our clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad or even to some computer,” said the head of Rosturism.
Formerly, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the free shipment of baggage on a non-returnable air ticket.
This means that airlines can determine for themselves the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-return tariff.
Vladimir Putin has ordered the elimination of Baikal contamination.
Russian President Vladimir Putin reported at a meeting on the protection of Baikal that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been subject to extreme pollution.
It mandated the identification of sources of funding, plans and implementers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin has also commissioned a full-scale remediation of contaminated areas.
“The facilities that continue to work here need to be dealt with, most of them are worn out,” quotes the president's RIA News.
He also added that the Office of the Prosecutor-General of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental disturbances by recreational organizers.
“I want to emphasize this: not everything is checked, there is also a measure to know, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities that need to be addressed,” he stressed.
Previously, the Office of the Attorney-General had reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of sites subject to environmental supervision.
On 15 June, Vladimir Putin, on a straight line, announced the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special protection regime.
He was informed of the problems of economic activity by the inhabitants of Olhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory.
The head of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Sergei Donska, immediately proposed to resolve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the Buryatia Government was reminded that such a change was not sufficient, as restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, the Ministry of Economic Affairs had proposed a solution by amending the Land Code and the Law on Environmental Protection.
There will be a new temple in Yubrah.
In the village of Sosiva, members of the community from the small indigenous peoples of the North “Rakhtiña”, together with residents of the Berezov region, are involved in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honour of the Holy Mandator, Nikolai Mirdičev.
Its location is a river bank, and the temple will be visible from afar, so it will serve as a traveling beacon for fishermen.
According to the community, construction work will be completed this year, domes are now in place and church bells are available.
The Navy’s REB provided escorts.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Miracle because it is respected by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travellers, including fishermen.
In Sahiva, however, fishing works for settlers, feeds them.
The locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and the children even write about it as a local sight in school essays.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why does Singapore respect laws?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while he carefully stores an iron box from his office.
After the conversation is over, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - 100 meters - and throws the bulls there.
A fine for garbage in a public place of $500 is reported by Chang.
You know, I've just had a reflex since I was a kid. You can't throw a candy fan on a bridge, they're gonna fine you instantly.
And now there's cameras all over the place.
Indeed, Singapore’s sidewalks in the middle of the city are as clean as a museum.
Chang tells us that three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted graffiti on an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine that.
He received ten lashes of a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
Corporal punishment is not uncommon at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and extremely harsh laws, an AIF columnist was on the spot.
No one here is thinking of abolishing the death penalty, which is why lawyer Victor Lee Hong explains.
And the government has long failed to give a damn about the opinion of both the EU and the US on this.
If a person transports or trades a large amount of drugs, he or she is hung.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian national was detained at Changi airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian Premier, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope.
But the guy ended up hanging anyway.
After that, the drug couriers in our country are doing their best to get around.
The point is that in Singapore, laws are required to comply with everyone in a row, not just modest and poor people.
It doesn't matter if you're a millionaire, a vice prime minister, a famous artist, or an EU resident.
There's only one option here: if you get a half a kilo of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and you meet a bunch of warning signs everywhere, you're like, "How many prohibitions in this city-state?"
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies and can be bought strictly by prescription (!) of the doctor.
A tourist won't lose his gum when he arrives, but if you put a rubber on the subway, a fine of 1,000 local dollars will be paid.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around my neck, "I was trashing."
In addition to being fined, cigarette butts thrown by the urn are often sentenced to a “shut-in”: a week to clean parks and beaches.
6,000 roubles is paid by a “criminal” who has forgotten to wash away the water in the public toilet, and when he tries to clean up a small need in the elevator of a residential house, a special detector is used to block the doors and send a signal to the police.
Exotic laws include bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public performances of songs, and even excessive watering of a room plant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers cannot carry lighters to the subway, otherwise they will be fined S$5,000.
Anyway, there's this idea that no matter how hard you try, you're gonna break something.
That's not true, he's trying to clear me up with Mohammed Kabir-Kajariyah, the owner of a local travel agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years, I haven't seen anyone get involved for violating them.
Why do they stay in place?
So the citizens don't relax.
The basic rules are strictly enforced.
Let's say if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, they'll all be punished along the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge sum, the intruder himself will be hit with sticks on the back part, and the seller will also be flogged and imprisoned.
It is precisely because of such harsh laws that offences are very rare in Singapore.
Is that justified?
As early as the 1970s, we had road chaos, with motorists ignoring traffic lights, driving as they wished, getting drunk behind the wheel.
After the year's fines, it all calmed down.
Now the driver, having a drink of whiskey, knows that if they stop, the police officer won't let go for a bribe, they'll fine the price of the apartment, and they'll send him to jail for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia feel that the city-state is a form of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneiland with the Death Penalty," a guest from the United States horrifying the common wealth of the inhabitants, "a frighteningly clean airport" and "cultural nature".
Such things are unnatural, look artificial, and they shouldn't in principle be.
First days in Singapore, and you're really afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you're gonna pop in if you're on the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the Little India area, and suddenly, the pattern break, and there's plastic cups lying around the bus stop.
"What do you mean?" you're surprised.
Like this, the Singaporeans are laughing.
Things happen.
Not every crime like that will get caught on the spot, but you need to know that if you're identified, you won't get away with it, because you broke the law.
More often than not, it's enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, Singapore’s power is authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City, I was moving very carefully, and motorcyclists often steal smartphones and cameras from tourists.
In the middle of Paris, there's a lot of dirty bums and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to throw trash in the bins.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the safest, cleanest and safest city on earth, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless laws (up to the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
This is human nature: remember, no one in Russia was wearing a seat belt until they were fined.
Although it was not fines but voluntary law enforcement that mattered in Singapore.
And I have to think that people in Russia would also be happy to have clean streets, no trash in the subway, and to have those who mix the elevator with the public bathroom arrested.
There's corporal punishment, thank you, don't.
Otherwise, Singapore’s laws are at least worth looking at.
Nothing holy?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting the statues.
Americans understand this just as well as everyone else - from here is the deliberate theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue at Pirdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump's key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he planted a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a violent dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the President's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't attempt the statue itself.
A bunch of pleasure ship owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do it.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially of the meaning she was given in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when Emma Lazarus' poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at Acosta, "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that shines the world.
The poem you're talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was right about the facts, but like he said, it's not really about history.
It's about the current sound of the amazing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming of a free breath, / the unhappy waste of your abundant shores."
Never before have the "unfortunate scum" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature, he made it clear that Trump wasn't expecting these people in America.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to place her words on the basement of the statue after her death - knew very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The design of the sculpture was to mark the link between the French and American republics through a banal classic figure, the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of a poem and an image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right, though, changed it back.
Rash Limbo, a kind of John the Baptizer who announced Trump's arrival in 2010, argued that freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neo-conservator carrying America's flame to the darkness of the world: “Freedom goes forward.
It carries the United States freedom torch to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the United States."
Against Limbo's custom, it's really a point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted, unhappy, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Its statue answers them with the words of hope and hospitality that they desire to hear.
And, of course, that's not the prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch is not needed to light the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
The 2017 World Cup: Neil Blake commends the Scottish members of the UK team.
Eilid Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scots in the UK.
Neil Blake, director of the Federation of Athletics, stated that a 16-man Scottish team at the World Cup would make a "significant contribution to the team's game".
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the London Championships of 2017, which began on Friday.
Blake believes that Scotland is having something special, and the Federation of Athletics of Great Britain should take that into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand it and we're going to support it as long as they have potential," Blake said.
"I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's related to what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that what they've done has to work.
The British Athletics Federation: What they've done must be addressed.
And people on the street think the same.
I don't know why the circumstances are like this, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some of the Scottish trackers claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres; and Eilid Doyle chose his captain.
"Aylid's being modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"Many trackers, whether Scottish or not, and where they live or train, came out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eilid put into her were wonderful."
The winner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth Championship, which will run 400 metres with obstacles at its fifth World Cup, says that 16 Scottishs in the British team are "unbelievable."
The previous record for the Scottish World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, who specializes in middle-distance racing and beat five British and two European records last year, is on the way.
She's gonna run 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who's going to be in the 1500 m race, is another Scotsman who deserves attention: behind his back, he has a successful season in which he won the British team selections and the annual competitions.
Doyle recalls his first world championship, when the only Scottish on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "unbelievably proud" of the fact that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight to make the finals.
"The captain of the team is chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen is a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
This shows how much we've achieved.
And they're all long-runned trackers who'll try to get into the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from fans and take advantage of the fact that we're going to be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to get into his arena and take part in the competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just great."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't run for public office unless you're ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but that did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Of course, his criticism was annoying.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "It's possible to take away the freedom of speech and lead us deaf and dumb to slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and erased at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "what and what."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people will say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's an amazingly popular Republican governor in a state-based democracy.
He's second in the approval rating among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan's not a stubborn reactionary.
He has shown a strong hand in the management of the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook cleverly as a primary way of communicating with his constituents and shows his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
It is therefore unnecessary and ultimately harmful to block people who come to the Governor ' s page, which is declared an official public forum and is run by the administration with taxpayer money.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokesperson Amelia Ches defended the Governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments was just a recapitulation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spamers, and haters on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are the real people, not trolls, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, informative, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, arguing that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed at his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comment section on the post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, some people say right away that it's a so-called loop instead of admitting they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call a "active life stance."
In the Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is far less dusty than before when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical front lines, or arresting and silenced protesters.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just in the figure.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users, who have been covered in his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning points on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Kasheris of Alexandria, the Chairman of the Laudon County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by turning the voter over on her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bavin was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, D.C., the era of affordable postal spending was a coup d’état similar to today’s Internet.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers increased fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters severely undermined his authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the alias "Yuricola", "Valerios", "Belizarius" and "Porzius" wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington's online paper project, his office was overwhelmed by petitions critical of his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lie at the very heart of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty looks forward to a home at the Renaissance Club.
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes to be comfortable in the next three days, when the Renaissance Club in East Lotus will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who led the club next door to Archerfield Links, moved towards the final round last year until he lost to Paul Ilsa, was assigned to a new location and served as a representative of the tournament on behalf of Jerry Sarvadi's founder and director.
“I've seen the Renaissance club build, and we're watching it succeed with this event,” Rafferty said.
"The players will see this field at its best moment, it's in a magnificent state.
Jerry did a great job putting this place together.
He is a keen supporter of this game and proud of his achievements here.
It's a great demonstration for this field."
Englishman Ils is looking forward to winning the championship for the first time, despite his 32-year career winning both the European Challenge Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
“It really is a special feeling,” said the player from Southport.
"I failed to try again to win Extremadura Open, because it was removed from the calendar a year after I won it.
It's magical to go back to this corner of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a truly special time, and we will always remember it."
Returns to battle in Gary Orr's native land, joining the European tournament for senior athletes after he turned 50.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
“When you play at home, it's always a little more important,” said Helensboro Orr.
"You want to speak well, but you feel this extra burden."
I was very happy to play again, and I did a pretty good golf.
I'm happy with the way things are so far."
On the field, the former winner of the Masters tournament, Ian Woosnem, and the senior sports champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will join this trio.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scottishs on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuire, and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs £5 an hour if there's one person in the car and £10 if there's two or more people.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Road tunnels that can absorb carbon monoxide emitted by motor vehicles are already being tested on British roads.
The country's transport agency reported on the positive results of testing a 100-metre tunnel on a highway in the north of the country, according to Autocar.
The 6-metre-high tunnel is made of some of the latest polymeric materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the establishment of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the massive measures that the British authorities are about to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are planning to expand the network of electric charging stations, implement a number of road traffic reduction measures, expand the use of commercial electric propulsion and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, one quarter of all air pollution occurs in transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Moshorsud changed the punishment of the disabled Mamayev to a fine
Moshorsud changed the punishment of the disabled Anton Mamaev, who was sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
TASS reports it.
Previously, the Public Prosecutor's Office had asked the court to change the period to a conditional one, explaining that Mamayev's disease “prevents him from being found in prison”.
Anton Mamaev, aged 28, was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment and served a sentence in a general-regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former SWAT fighter.
On 19 July, the judge released the man at a retreat in SIZO.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia’s Golden Land
Bardin Deguei doesn't use the stove when he's making dinner.
She doesn't even use the pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the mutinous Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply puts sweet potatoes, which are called "nota", right in the fireplace.
After half an hour, a charred tuber is drawn and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Deguei sits on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and it is here that she does her housework, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom is a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk in the village after five p.m.”, she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony that was joined to Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote in public in front of the occupying forces.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta Government, which retains strong control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders from being allowed.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as an abandoned city; the road here includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the capital of the province, to Nabir, and then a five-hour shake in a hired car.
There's no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust into a variety of reddish shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners, arrived here.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, my pago was worshiped by a god named Uga Tamei.
There have been other changes.
“We were not used to wearing these clothes,” Deghei says, pointing at his bright, hand-wrapped turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on the body.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 per cent of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a Phoenix-based company, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast of a stock of forests valued at $78 billion.
These wealths, however, bring one misfortune to the Papuas, guaranteeing that Indonesia’s powerful armed forces retain their strangling presence.
According to an investigation into The New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy by the Papuas threaten the existence of this gold mine and are mercilessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, over 500,000 Papuas have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacre of indigenous peoples in the highlands of Papua in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything”, a report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane provides evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture – particularly frequent, as stated in another report, rape and electrocution – and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is hard to count the number of victims because incidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harsono, researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts have been prolonged as Papua's resources have attracted an influx of displaced persons from other parts of Indonesia.
The province’s 3.5-millione population is 83 percent Christian, but the demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Yavan shops, the Varungi, sell fried chicken and a mixture of hag-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to withstand competition.
“Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market at a cheaper price than the indigenous Papuans,” explains Abet Yo, a twenty-four-year-old Paniai who moved to Jayapuru, the provincial capital, because of her work.
“As a result, the indigenous Papuan mother (women) of Papua has lost their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokovi, vowed to address inequality and human rights violations in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter secured support from 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, little has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, expecting him to fulfil our hopes for justice,” Yow says.
In fact, just two months after the inauguration of October, Jokovi Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas anthems at the fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the dark.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, a soldier was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers after a while.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk chased the children and hit them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Yemo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to a government office nearby, and the next day, the situation worsened.
About a thousand Papuasian men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed White, a dance of the Papuas my pago tribe, running in circles and playing bird singing.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation escalated, the soldiers were ordered by internal radio: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them”, as claimed in an official document seen by the correspondents of TIME magazine, but which was not published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremías Kayama, head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, I suddenly had a bullet in my left wrist,” he told "TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayama still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the sherry of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were many shots,” he adds.
A local resident of Alfius Yowa was shot three times, as his cousin told him when he witnessed the shooting.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” he told the magazine "TIME" Johanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, the Chief Inspector of Papua Police, told reporters that his officers were merely “protecting” their base because she was under attack.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Papua Police Commissioner Pujo Sulistiyo in 2015.
“It is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The murder news only got to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately, so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Viranto said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately, the excuses came out.
“Most of the violations occurred long ago.
Some occurred in the nineties or early zeros.
The point is, we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures to go through," he said.
Viranto then retracted his words, speaking to the magazine "TIME" on 5 June in Jakarta, and said that he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be judged.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people in a bloody vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims in Paniaj had received such statements with a dark mistrust.
“I have been questioned four times over the past three years, but there has been no change whatsoever,” Johanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacobus, too, expressed the view that the people of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten up by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in the neighbouring Paniai district of Deiya.
In a clash between the villagers and the construction manager, who refused to help take the unconscious man to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others, including children, were injured.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the site office belonging to the company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) started shooting at a crowd and killed a man.
“We were in such a panic, we were afraid of retaliation,” reported TIME magazine, a twenty-nine-year-old Domingu Badia, who lived near the hospital and saw the wounded being rushed.
“I've been hiding in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Paniaj has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is caused by discontent among the Mei, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the greened central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Free Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuas by carrying out sporadic attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the OPM's top leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kohaya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniaj in recent years and arbitrarily detained by the military under the pretext of “protecting national independence”.
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniai, it is considered “a sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty exacerbates discontent.
A small amount of rice sold in Enarotaly is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is equally unaffordable.
People here grow everything they eat, mostly a note, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubers worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over the years, economic disparities between indigenous Papuas and new migrants have increased and increased since the introduction of new flights to Nabira airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually filled by better educated and wealthy migrants.
Papouas rarely have the money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people do not want to stay in the village... because there is no job or money,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of the international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Esquiudi and Basil Longshan were deported from Papua for “lack of coherence with relevant organizations” despite being given rare permissions to film.
According to Felim Keene, Asia’s deputy director of Human Rights Watch, the promises made during Jokovi’s campaign to lift media restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Foreign journalists now trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: denial of visas and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
A lack of media attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands – requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arramanata Nasir, retracted the group's statement, informing journalists in Jakarta that “Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights Kiys Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the locals broke the silence, praying “We want freedom”, as claimed by the source, who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but the papals say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokovi again.
“Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, apart from living in the shadow of a threat from the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health care are in poor condition.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like the other Papuas, consider their vote for Jokovi to be the duty he must pay.
“They don't need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniaj carried out the latest symbolic act of disobedience, burying the body of one of the victims on a piece of land just opposite the police station and the military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Jakobus says, without raising his head.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
The fire covers the second time the Dubai Tower of Faquel
The fire engulfed one of the world's highest skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave a 70-nine-story structure 337 meters high.
This is the second fire to hit a high-rise building – a coincidence called "Fackel" – in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported and there was no operational news about the fire.
“We slept and woke up from fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” told Reuters a skyscraper called George.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Department, fire brigades extinguished the fire at approximately 4 a.m. local time (00 a.m. Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working on providing shelter to victims.
The incident may bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in exterior high-rise buildings around the world.
In an investigation by the Faquel administration after the fire there in 2015, it was found that the most affected was the postering, the external panels used for presentation and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the placarding panels of the Grenfell Tower in London could have accelerated the spread of the fire there in June, which killed some 80 people.
Ida Viruma ' s increased tourist flow in June was minimal
According to data received by the correspondent of the rus.err.ee portal in the Department of Statistics, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists benefited from the North-East hotel services in June 2017, an increase of 125 persons or 0.6 per cent over the same period the year before.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased and the number of foreign tourists increased.
In June, for example, foreign tourist arrivals rose by 7.3 per cent (544) to 7,994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent, from 12,944 to 12,525.
The largest increase in Russian tourist arrivals in the region was 8.9 per cent or 318 compared with June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at the Ida-Viruma hotels.
Andrei Malakhov told his fans who was responsible for his departure.
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans at Instagram who was responsible for his departure from Channel One.
So far, he has not commented on the rumours, but today he posted a piece of a newspaper article on August 1st.
Malakhov's photo was signed by the boss-sucker tag.
An article on how to prevent the “burning” of an employee and to pay attention to his or her condition.
If you recall the numerous reports that the host was unable to communicate with the newly arrived producer, who decided to reformat "Let 'em speak", it is clear what he has so transparently hinted at, he writes "KP".
Television anchor Andrei Malakhov is reportedly currently on leave and has not signed a letter of resignation from Channel 1.
The dismissal situation could be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five military personnel were killed in a car explosion
At least five soldiers died in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, transmitting RIA News.
According to the police, a bomb exploded the night before the military checkpoint in Girishk County.
We know about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new emergency occurred in Girika.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange post.
The exchange of fire between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver made a video of a shark biting his camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured a shark on a video that bit his GoPro action camera.
It featured on Facebook a unit of the United States Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, of which Scomal is a member.
The incident occurred on 2 August, off the coast of Cape Cod in the north-east of the United States, clarifying the Necn portal.
During the dive, a man tried to film a shark on a camera he held on a special stick.
After observing the man, an animal more than three metres in length came up to him.
The shark started biting the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator did the same thing to determine if the gadget was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the instrument.
He also observed that such behavior by a marine animal was new to scientists.
The cause of the mass fighting in the Ural military centre became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military Region to investigate the incident arrived at the Jelan Training Centre, where there was a massive fight.
Some details of this beating have already come to light.
According to the Mash public on the VKontakte page, the Urailian military unit's contractors number 31612 had a violent fight over an untied bed.
It all began with a private man named Saiyan blatantly ignoring an officer's order to fill up a standing sheet.
The officer was sidelined by soldiers from the sixth company.
Saiyan supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men ransacked the barracks with beds and sinks, broken glass.
More than 10 people were injured in a mass fight.
The C.E.O. denied the information about the stabbing.
A study found that at least one fifth of passengers in the United States carry prohibited items into an airplane.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items into the aircraft ' s luggage through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration inspection points, including at least 6 per cent boarded the aircraft, inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., and reaching over 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately attempted to fly with something banned by the ATB, 19.7 per cent were billions, compared to less than 15 per cent of the X generation.
Food and water are most often passed by by ATM staff.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had specially carried sharp objects through the search, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried illicit drugs on the plane.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had accidentally been smuggled through airport searches and how many had done so knowingly.
It is expected that most often, knowingly or unconsciously, smuggling is carried through searches by those who fly the most.
According to the company, the ATB rules are complicated and complicated.
People often don't know exactly what kind of fluids they can carry and how much.
So it's not surprising that most of what the A.T.A. takes are forbidden liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that the A.T.B. might be considered illegal to transport a book.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA chapter Pruitt abandons his intention to delay Obama’s emission reduction rules.
The day after the 15 state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to postpone Obama regulations to reduce emissions of air pollutants and smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that his agency was now more responsive than in previous administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not mention a claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute began on 1 October, by which time the states must meet the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would defer compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid “inconsistency with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, who had been the Attorney General of Oklahoma before President Trump was appointed to his current position, was long known as a consistent opponent of stricter environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of regulations that were opposed by the chemical or gas oil industry.
The sudden change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of Pewitt's policy of returning to previous standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of EPA had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the Obama administration’s rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that by changing the course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the EPA's obligation to work with the states in an integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“In previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to meet its target dates, then waited for action by groups of activists and others, and discussed the time frame during the settlement of the case,” Pruitt said, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in the regulation of trials, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our statutes and the authority that he gives us.”
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may, at some point, use his “authority for postponement and other statutory powers” to ensure that the “jcyjdfys” rule is clear and accessible.
Republicans in Congress are pressing for a broader revision of the ozone regulations.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to delay compliance with the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue legal pressure.
"A change in the course of the EPA, after our lawsuits, is an important victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that surrounds their cities," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaver, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., joined the New York lawsuit.
Ozone at the ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
This could cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people, resulting in thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmental advocates welcomed Pruitt's unexpected change of course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the man who's supposed to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Bird of the Biodiversity Center.
"We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) voted in favour of extending the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics (WFLA).
In this way, Congress supported the IAAF Council for WFLA Reconstruction, which issued a report on Monday recommending that suspension be maintained.
One hundred and sixty-six people voted in favour of the extension, twenty-one against, and passed on the TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that the WFLA had made significant progress towards achieving the conditions set by the re-establishment board, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to WFLA's disqualification from the London World Cup, Russian trackers were forced to fly a neutral flag.
Nineteen people were admitted to the IAAF team.
WFLA was permanently disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
At that time, a report by the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Dick Pound, was published, highlighting numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the IAAF board's latest report, see IAAF's "IAAF has extended the WFLA sanctions."
It's a bad hit.
Within the framework of the 3rd round of the Fonbet First Russia, the newo-Skovi "Himik" was a retreat against the FC Kaluga.
A little over 10 days ago, rivals played in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was quite different.
The Chemist didn't give up anything to the opponent, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the caludians with a 0:3 count, many had promised an easy victory for the masters in advance.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the Novices had been forced to count and acted from a defensive position, but from a position of force.
In the first half of the year, the kaludans were more creative and had an advantage in owning the ball.
Another very high-quality match was played by Alexei Sirotin, who repeatedly reflected dangerous blows and gave confidence to his partners.
Unfortunately, the attack on Chemuk lacked the effort and the luck to put the Kaluga defenses at bay and score the first goal on the way out.
After a break, the game began to take place in the oncoming courses.
Newcomers are more active in the attack.
An alarming call for our team was a defence error that allowed the cabals to create a number of hot spots.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, the Chemist intercepted the territorial advantage and launched several dangerous attacks.
But the Caludian experience played its part - they spent the end in a better and colder manner, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the Chemist moved the ball to the corner, which was handed over to the gate by the owners of the fields without resistance.
The goal was written by Yuri Dubrovin.
In the briefing, the Chemist showed a good game, but suffered a painful defeat.
Our team is waiting for another exit at 7 p.m. on 11 August in Moscow, at the "Torpedo" stadium of Eduard Ströltsov, the new Russians will fight the favorite of the "Centre" group "Ararat", with Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support Chemist!
The place and time of the meeting of the Novoskovics was 6.30 p.m. near the Magnolia store (East, D.2, Corp. v.
Composition of Chemika: Sirotin, Manohin (k), Romašchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Doudaichi, Ryzhov, Saints, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to published phone transcripts, Trump presses Mexico about paying for the wall at the border.
The Washington Post published a transcript of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and leaders in Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieta Trump insisted that he stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The President of the United States was challenging him for publicly speaking against the wall, and according to leaked information, he said to him, “You cannot say this to the press.”
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated altercation in the published transcript.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should accept refugees going to Australia was "funny," "detestable" and "stupid," and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees in the US.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation of the day."
The bodies of the victims in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
The aircraft belonging to the Russian airline, carrying the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia, left Sochi for St. Petersburg at 20:15 Moscow time and handed over TASS.
At the end of the journey, members of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's mayor's office, will meet with journalists from the Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamyr Ahba.
The representatives of the MES of the Republic had previously stated that all costs associated with bringing the bodies back to Russia had been borne by the Abkhaz Government.
In addition, the official Sukhumi intends to pay 500,000 roubles to the families of the deceased.
According to Akhba, the Abkhaz leadership expressed its willingness to pay the relatives of the victims of the tourist bombings for flight and residence in the Republic, but the relatives sent only the power of attorney to the Republic to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On 2 August, at about 16:20 Moscow time, two explosions broke out in the village of Primorsk, Gudauta district, in a missile-artillery storage facility of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic, followed by the detonation of the large-calibre shells and other ammunition stored there.
As a result, a warehouse was set on fire, causing uncontrolled explosions of shells of various kinds.
As a result, two Russian citizens, Elena Poliakov, born in 1970, and Elena Timothy, born in 1962, were killed while on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
Sixty-four people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying degrees of severity, were taken to medical facilities in the Republic.
At present, seven persons remain in the hospital and the rest have been discharged.
The Russian influence on American elections will be studied by the grand jury.
Robert Müller, Special Prosecutor for Russia, convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., to study Russia's influence on the US presidential election in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected material will be examined by the Special Prosecutor ' s Office and will decide whether it is sufficient to bring charges.
The grand jury is giving Mueller additional powers to gather evidence.
One of the topics of the jury investigation, which started a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of his son, then President candidate Donald Trump, with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnica.
Muller himself had previously promised to check the details of that meeting, which took place in June 2016.
They've already been investigated by the FBI.
At the end of July, Donald Trump Jr. was reported to have expanded his legal staff.
Trump Jr. told me earlier that he had been waiting for the Hillary Clinton Demparture's headquarters to be compromised by a meeting with Funcelnica, but that no disclosure documents had been submitted, and that the issue was adoption.
At the beginning of August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.'s announcement of a meeting with Vesselnica was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House made it clear that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would have done.
Vice-Mayor Penza was detained at work.
The deputy head of the administration of Penza Irina Shirshin was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigation Committee at his place of work, and reported to RIA Novosti.
No official reports have yet been received from the law enforcement authorities on this matter, but the UK Press Service has assured them that they will follow soon.
There's no comment at the City Hall of Penza yet.
Irina Shirshin is one of the five vice-heads of the Penza administration.
It has been in charge of urban development and land relations since April 2015.
Prior to that, she had worked for a long time as head of the Department of the State Department of the Penzene Region Inspectorate.
Irina Shirina is raising three underage children, and it is noteworthy that once again as a mother a year ago, she gave up maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no launch vehicle or launch vehicle in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first person who's ever been in space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet era, which are being demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, are being “scattered on the planet”.
In 2012, a monument was erected in American Houston near NASA's former headquarters.
In London, a monument at the Royal Observatory was erected to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfoot, where our astronaut visited in 1963.
The memorial in Karlovy Varah (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 as a result of public protests and was moved from the city centre to a square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin, a monument to Yurius Gagarinsu appeared in Riga.
That's what the first astronaut's name sounds like in Latvian, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford murder: activists will lose Lynch courts on stage to call for justice
"Ford Mercury" of 1948 passed the viewers in Monroe village, Georgia, and cried to a small Morse Ford bridge.
When a car carrying four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The chief, a middle-aged man in a thin stripe, took a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those inside were shivering with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" a man squirms.
"Get him out of the car!"
The piercing screams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that took place on July 22 is just an act.
But when Roger's neck got a noose, almost everyone in the audience actually held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night when two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey, were lynched in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
“It's amazing that in all these years no one has been arrested – although we see them with us; although we know who they are,” Tyrone Brooks said, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
Seventy-one-year-old Brooks is a former member of Georgia's Congress who has spent his entire life fighting for human rights.
To him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want investigations, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We cannot proceed to healing and reconciliation until we have justice."
The Coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the Morse Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI material received by NBC News, more than 50 individuals in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of involvement in lynching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although suspects have been at large for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of two related motives of vigilantes: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ' s ruling first allowed black citizens to vote on the primaries that were to take place that summer.
About the same election, according to the FBI, Black source Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman, in a fight.
Brooks says that according to rumours around town, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was supposed to have was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a major white landowner, paid $600 in bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of prison and drove to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded Harrison's murders," that's what one of the FBI's reports concludes.
"It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement agencies not only to take part in the murders, but also to destroy evidence and conceal the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a signal to black people in town: if you register and vote, you'll be the same."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene has been running an annual play that reproduces that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visible, he captures the audience and tells of the deep racism that many would like to think is no longer in America.
It's hard to look at, and it's harder to turn around, but Green thinks that's what matters.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals of this year began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors, a dozen whites, and the rest of the blacks, gathered in the room and listened to a re-enacted review of the play over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Greene.
He's been the chief member of the clan for years, but he says the role hasn't gotten any easier.
"I feel like I'm dirty because I'm not the man I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at the time."
In the room, the actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are repeating their roles.
Spectal starts with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Shouting Rascon in return.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) is laughing.
Green laughs loudest.
"What's the matter," asks Ascon.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I overdoing it?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the whites used to say 'nigga'."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You've got to read the solid "r."
And there's also a change in the energy in the room: the discomfort changes from a sense of partnership.
Everything has to be done right, not just for the play, but for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the "N" word, it's clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The show ends cruelly and quickly.
Shouting, shooting, and then silence.
The woman in the mourning black dress stands above the bodies of the actors and sings Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
A hundred yards away, half a hundred viewers wipe out tears and sweat.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to watch the show; many live close by.
They've all endured Georgia's heavy perfume for almost eight hours while Brooks took them on a pilgrimage to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until then, the murders were only a story, but now that they're standing in the same spot where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are in the air.
When the last note of the song fades, Greene invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend over to their heads, touch blood paint, and static bodies, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mumbles to remind himself of that.
In a few minutes, Greene is thanking the audience, and suddenly it's over.
Actors drop ropes off the neck and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main puppet.
Nick Rascona hugs the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional burden of the play finally came upon him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know your heart is good.
You had your reasons."
Later, the audience sits down for dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta livelyly discuss a play with a black couple they just met.
Denise Daplinski has trouble finding words to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to listen to those horrible, horrible words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now it's called the police shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, captured general attention.
He says he's already started planning next year's performance.
"The production is encouraging because it not only describes the horror of what we've been through, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it.”
The court fined Navalny for violations on the "saturday vigil"
The Simon Court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 roubles for disrupting the organization of the rally.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20.2, paragraph 8, of the Code of Administrative Procedure of the Russian Federation, “Re-infringement of the organization of the meeting”.
Formerly, Judge Hizyr Mussakaev of the Simonov Court of Moscow had concluded an administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the Chief of Staff of the opposition, Alexey Navalny, who had been prosecuted under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In that amount, Judge Moussakaev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the “Saturday Guide”, which Navalny's supporters had been conducting in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
After seeing the agitation materials, the police considered that the organizers of the event had deliberately concealed its true nature - a public action (for which prior permission had to be sought from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazouyev requested the administrative proceedings to be terminated because of the absence of the offence and pointed out that the police had failed to draw up a report.
Volkov was not detained at the "campaign" itself, but he received a summons requiring him to report to the police station about an event he had actively participated in.
Navalny and another member of the opposition, Nikolai Lyaskin, received the same summons.
In Mordova, the bride-to-be and three wedding guests were arrested.
The court in Mordova arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported to the Republican Investigation Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of July 29th.
During an argument, a 42-year-old resident of Saranska shot several times at the guests of the event who had come to the village pond to bathe.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code (Hooliganism), article 30, paragraph 3 and article 105, paragraph 2 (a), (e), (e), (e) and (e) of the Criminal Code ( Attempt to kill two or more persons in a generally dangerous manner with hooliganist motives).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man had opened fire because the wedding guests, having decided to take a bath, had passed through the area to the watershed.
Minergo will tighten the requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the regulations on the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, hydropower turbines, oil refineries and oil production are launched, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data with Minergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government Regulation is ready and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will apply only to “critical energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
The document identifies as potential threats the acquisition of information and access to the management of the facility by foreign intelligence agencies, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The EU has increased anti-Russian sanctions due to Siemens
On 4 August, the EU Press Service announced that the anti-Russian sanctions had been increased because of the scandal surrounding the Siemens turbines in Crimea.
This was previously reported by the Arguments of the Week.
The EU Council Press Service stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been increased by the Siemens Turbine scandal, which had allegedly been taken to Crimea in circumvention of the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
It had previously been reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the day, and the decision had been taken, and the sanctions against Russia had been expanded.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life.
On Friday, the British educational group Pearson announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of provisional dividends by 72 per cent as a result of the start of another restructuring programme aimed at addressing the problems their businesses face.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fallon’s head of company, will occur mainly in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs that were cut during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that he was planning to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May during the third cost-cutting programme to try to bring back the business that was hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
Last month, a company that agreed to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 per cent increase in sales of the main product in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier killed in a suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as stated in a NATO report.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the Karabakh city area.
This explosion is the last of the bloodshed that struck Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO reports that the Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with an “immoved explosive device carried by a man”.
All the wounded are reportedly in stable condition and receiving treatment at the American military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Respondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to UN reports, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bombing in a car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed that they had launched the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion killed more than 150 people in the center of the city – the country’s worst casualty since the Taliban were removed from power by United States-led forces in 2001.
Violence highlights the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether there is a need to increase the number of U.S. military forces providing support to troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its course of conduct and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
After legal action, the Environmental Protection Agency reverses the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed the decision to postpone the Obama Act, which requires states to limit air pollution the day after 15 states sue the agency because of this move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “Ozone measurements 2015”, emphasizing that this step demonstrated the Agency’s willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our state partners,” Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone ozone measurements, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where to reduce it to meet stricter air purity standards by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, filed a lawsuit with the Federal District of Columbia claiming that the intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme, which Trump says, aims at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has provoked resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large-scale emissions on public health.
The website of the Environmental Protection Agency states that the use of ozone-containing air for breathing “may worsen lung function and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
The European Business Association opposed new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, and therefore the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from EU countries and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of State and Government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new course of action that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
The deputies are asking the police to restrict traffic on the waterfront in Pskov.
The Pskov People ' s Electors addressed the Director of the Internal Affairs Department for the town of Sergei Surina on the problem of movement along the Great River.
The deputies of the proud Konstantin Bolotin, Grigori Mezhenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, the control of drivers would help to make the area safer and safer.
The problem is that violators ignore the “Trailway” signs and drive freely along the waterfront.
It turns out that the major repairs and improvements have been wasted.
Sports and children's playgrounds are getting uncomfortable because of cars.
As noted by the Pskov Information Agency, the central waterfront is patrolled in the evenings by the PPP Motopater and its associates.
As a result, the number of vehicles passing is reduced, but the total traffic does not stop.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to seize hard drives.
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed that investigative bodies should be banned from removing servers and hard drives from working computers in enterprises.
This was stated by the Head of State at the meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, “the use of measures leading to the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from work computers and servers, should be excluded for the purposes of investigation”.
Putin noted that if the investigators have such a need, “it is sufficient to make copies, to assure them and to use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that “it is not possible to create conditions that prevent the enterprise from continuing to operate until such time as taxes cannot be paid”.
Olga Busova told me how much she wanted to call her ex-husband.
TV host Olga Busova admitted that she really wanted to call her former soccer husband, Dmitry Tarasov.
At present, the celebrity is in the United States, where he works.
Olga visited Las Vegas just the day before, after which she decided to publish a post on Instagram's social network.
She reported that she had not been married, had not made new tattoos, and had not called her ex-wife, saying that he had ruined her life, although she was eager to do so.
Busova said she'd remember this trip forever, because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Minister of Magic Cornelius Fadge in filming a series of Harry Potter novels, died in the year of his life.
This was reported by the Independent on Thursday.
His family told us about the actor's death.
According to them, he lived “a great life, having succeeded in film, theatre and television in 70 years of his career”.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltnam.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier in "The Tragedy of Coriolaan".
Hardy was also remembered for his repeated role as Prime Minister of Winston Churchill, including in one of Agatha Christie's films about Miss Marple.
He was also awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for his role in the BBC television drama "Winston Curchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981).
Robert Hardy has also served as President of the United States on several occasions, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Something rotted in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with his crown wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year the four have a golden wedding, but the couple's agenda isn't about preparing for the celebrations, it's about seditious argument.
His Highness renounced the title of Prince Consort, and he insisted on the Queen that she had never given him the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially married to the Queen.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on Washington to stop shaming Moscow.
In the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they reacted to Mike Pens’ remarks accusing Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated by the foreign policy agency some time ago.
In its commentary, the MFA pointed out that the United States was increasingly using cold war stamps that were inadequate to current realities.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the United States authorities to stop scorning the Russian Federation.
As The Arguments of the Week wrote the previous day, US Vice President Mike Pens accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive match.
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be moving steadily towards the most exciting boxing match of up to £147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of ESPN in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the champion of the World Boxing Organization in the second half weight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-weight world champion, Erian Broner, on Saturday's Showtime channel, both boxers ranked among the top five boxers, regardless of weight categories.
Garcia reached out to his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7:00 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that a potential decisive fight between them would be perfect.
"I used to be half-weighted," recalls Garcia.
"I went up for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm not enough for 140.
I want to go down to half-light.
And he needs to get up to a half-lung, and then we'll have a fight.
That's what fans want.
Let's make it up to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Box needs this fight."
Climas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through PPV as part of the strategy he has followed for Lomachenko to conduct his first 135th fight later this year to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, which is also interested in fighting the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the World Lightweight Championship on the Forum stage on 23 September.
“The fight may be on the PPV because all the fans asked for it,” Garcia said, later expressing his willingness to fight on a channel that would offer better financial terms.
“We are the main names.
No other names would be of such interest.
As soon as they're ready..."
Garcia said that he thought Lomachenko was "an amazing boxer" and might be visiting his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately tell Garcia that he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you were asking for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the force of the strike, and then boxing.
They both said they felt that the tension was increasing before their own fight.
“This fight must take place.
No other fight is about so much interest and talk.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight."
On several central streets, Moscow will block traffic for the weekend.
This weekend, 5 and 6 August, traffic will be restricted in the capital on Tver Street from the Nastasian alley to the Triumph Square, as well as on 1st Tver-Yama Street.
In addition, the passage will be closed on Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tverskaya Yam Street.
On all sections, the closure will operate on both lanes, as reported by the Transport Information Centre of the Moscow Department.
The streets will be closed from midnight on 5 August until 5 a.m. on 7 August due to their upgrading.
Also on weekends, traffic will be closed down at the section of the Moscow waterfront.
That's where the charge park is still being built.
Putin's got the D.A.'s office check out Baikal.
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to verify the territory of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“I ask the Office of the Attorney General to check the Baha'i territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities”, Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested that action be taken if violations were found.
New results of tests to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
Recent tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden, which had been subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, showed that more than 80 per cent of those tested had been assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trusted the accuracy of those results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedianalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age estimate of asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, the Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensics agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent of the (2002) testees were rated as 18 years or older, and in another 25 cases, the forensics agency estimated that the test was "probably 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “probably under 18”.
Tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is in doubt.
According to Johann Görancen of the forensics agency, the results are consistent with those of the past months.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics from the past months, the numbers are quite the same,” he said to The Local portal.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, “most likely, the age of the test is 18 years or more.”
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person had openly declared that 18 of them would be performing this year.
The method of conducting a medical age assessment, which is to X-ray wisdom teeth and tomography of the knee joints and test them for dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Caroline Institute of Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of humans to determine whether they have reached puberty earlier or later than normal.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don't think I should use the measurement methods that are being used.
The biological age is defined in this way very imprecisely.
If we can't determine it with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can, he said to Metro.
However, Göranssen of the forensics agency argued in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of mistaking a child for an adult is small.
We face the greatest risk when a person is 18 soon, in which case he is about 10 per cent.”
I'll see if I can run for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was willing to consider whether to run for Russian President in the 2018 elections, he was passing on the Interfax.
This statement was a response to a request from the villagers of Cheremushka village in the Buryat region.
During a videoconference on the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, Putin was approached by the interlocutor, who said, “Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request for you: when the next presidential election comes, we all ask you to run again for office”.
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," said the president.
On 28 July, Russian press spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on the comments of some media outlets that Vladimir Putin’s campaign headquarters would be headed by Anton Vino, chief of the Russian Federation’s administration.
Peskov referred to these assumptions as “non-based, hypothetical reasonings”.
"As long as there's no headquarters, until headquarters are set up, it's a long way to the campaign," said Peskov.
"Until that's on the agenda," said Peskov.
The Governor of West Virginia stated that he was moving to another party.
Governor of West Virginia, Democratic Party spokesman Jim Justice announced on Thursday, during a rally with President Trump, that he was moving to another party.
“You like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today I tell you with many prayers and many thoughts... Today I tell you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of any use to you as a Democrat Governor.”
The match exploded with applause.
“Tomorrow, therefore, I will change my registration to a Republican,” Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you that time is different."
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia over 42 percent, and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited the coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “Governor Justice’s transition to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is preventing rather than working to make our country great again.”
“Considering only 15 governors and control of the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find positive, unifying messages,” said CBS News, a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel.
Cat heavyweight named Mr. Handsome found the house thanks to social media.
Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., has a cat named Mr. Handsome weighing more than 14 kilos since becoming famous through the Internet.
It's being reported by Masable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was posted on Facebook, asking him to find its owner because "it was clearly fed by someone before".
Users commented that the expression of an animal's face could be a new meme.
The publication received more than 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
In the commentary, dozens of people expressed a desire to host Mr. Handsome.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazie, who promised to take over his weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, an American woman said she had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
The animal photo post collected over 68,000 views.
Commentators said that she could make a career in the modeling business.
Coe praised Russia's “genuinely” apology for the doping scandal.
International athlete Sebastian Coe praised what he called Russia's sincere apologies for the doping scandal on Thursday, but reiterated that this is not the right time to allow the country to compete again.
The Russian representative of the Athletics Federation, Dmitry Schlachtin, reported at the Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Championship in Athletics, that his country's exclusion from sports was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who had gold and silver medals stolen at the competition."
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations voted to retain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of State-funded doping.
“I thought today’s response, today’s report, was very sincere,” the president of Coe’s International Association of Athletic Federations told reporters.
“The entire council and Congress enjoyed... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it was going through extremely hot times and is now doing its utmost to take care of the restructuring of the Federation.”
Koh said that he also “liked” that Russia accepted the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that now is not the time to restore Russia’s rights,” Koh said.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the stained system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletic Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the world championship on light athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met for Russia to recover.
As he told reporters in London after a report made to the council of the International Association of Athletic Federations, drug testing is still not done in sufficient amount, and suspended coaches are still doing their job quietly.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of being a statesman.
A journalist detained by the Security Service of Ukraine, Vasiliy Muravitsky, was placed in custody for two months and handed over to the Security Service.
A staff member of the online publication Journal Zhitomir is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and violating Ukraine's territorial integrity.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering this to be a “varvarian policy” against the media.
Two years after the migration crisis peaked in Europe, Italy decided to undertake a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The commandant Borsini patrol ship entered Libya's territorial waters to stop the influx of illegal migrants, together with the Navy.
The decision to launch the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome has agreed to it with the internationally recognized Libyan Government, which, however, does not control most of the country's territory.
The opposing Cabinet and the Tobrooke-based Libyan Parliament accused Italy of violating Libyan sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe these threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks of Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni and Head of the European-recognized Libyan Cabinet, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration, following the release in July of statistics on the number of illegal arrivals from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government had stated that resources to receive migrants had been exhausted.
Scaling Failed at Skype
A global malfunction of Skype was recorded today in several countries around the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, the users began to send a large number of complaints to the programme developers.
Microsoft stressed that experts were already working actively to address the problems faced by the people of Europe and North America, as explained by RIA News.
It should be recalled that Skype also failed in June of this year.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
Two Ukrainian track team leaders were suspended from participating in the FM.
Olga Landak and Olesa Powh, who specialize in short-distance racing, are excluded from the Ukrainian team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Athletics (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation by the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings against lightweight athletes.
Coach Sluk Serguei Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects female athletes to use doping.
She is the bronze medalist for the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, and is the winner of the European 2010 relay race, the winner of the 2012 European Championship in the 4-400-metre relay.
The World Athletics Championships in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neimar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world’s record-setting transfer of Neumar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
Any consequences may follow along the chain, for the Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, the governing body in charge of European football, whose authority prohibits teams from participating in the prestigious League of Champions tournament.
From the rules of the financial "fireplay" introduced by UEFA in 2011, it is clear that the SPG will eventually have to show that the Neumara transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid €222 million ($262 million) just to release the Brazilian from the contract, and Naymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
The SGW can certainly pay to hire Neumar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team from the energy-rich Qatari family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on buying players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the profitability threshold in their football business.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after his election as president of UEFA in 2007.
A former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their quest for success were in fact cheating and risk ruin if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on club debt and instead shifted to tracking losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential and then seriously spend to improve the team and create a world brand – became a difficult plan.
During the present three-year evaluation period, which is exciting in 2018, clubs may suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini's disgraceful withdrawal from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
“Of course, the FFP is alive, and we are moving forward to tighten the rules,” Andrea Traverso stated last week to Associated Press, which controls the FFP in UEFA.
Even though SPG will pay for the purchase of Neumar's contract at one time, it may, for the sake of accountability, distribute this amount over the duration of his contract.
Neumar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in annual accounts as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on SGW, as well as on Abu Dhabi's Manchester City.
The SPG was fined 60 million euros (82 million dollars at that rate), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit its team to the League of Champions during the 2014–15 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that might try to outsmart its financial inspectorates by boosting its income from companies associated with club owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor the SGW, if the amount of funding was considered to be above standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of CSW funding from the Qatar Tourism Authority had been inflated.
It was reported that a portion of Neimar's earnings from the SGW could have come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But the SGW and Qatar-2022 deny that Neumar will be the ambassador of the World Cup, and similar maneuvers could easily be discovered by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on the CSW mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in monitoring any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to those familiar with the situation, UEFA did not have any preliminary discussions with the SGW about the Neumar transfer on Thursday.
They spoke to Associated Press on an anonymous basis, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the “CSW”.
According to the latest published report, between 2015 and 1016, the SGC received more than 10 million euros in profits with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
The AWL expects the arrival of Neumar to be a fertile ground for sponsorship, the sale of attributes, and T-shirts with the team logo.
At the club, turnover is expected to grow by at least 30 per cent as a result of hiring a new player.
Unquestionably angry at the departure of one of the best football players, the Spanish league tried to prevent the Neumar transfer, claiming that the FGW would violate the financial fare play.
“This is an obvious case of `financial doping', with the club and the state,” said President Javier Tebas of La League of Spain to the Spanish newspaper AS, meaning that Qatar is the ultimate owner of SPG.
Arsenal Coach Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La League's doubts about State funding for the club.
“This is all the consequences of sharing, and it has completely changed the landscape of football in the last 15 years,” Hungarian stated on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It's becoming very difficult to keep a financial faeplay, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The President will determine the order and place of the oath.
Where and how new Russian citizens will pledge allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the President - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have been drafted by the State Committee on Legislation and State Building.
As early as a week ago, deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for taking the oath of office in the law.
Children under the age of 18, as well as those incompetent, will be exempted from taking a solemn oath, as follows from the revised text of the amendments to the draft law on citizenship of the Russian Federation (as contained in the “Izvestya”) which the committee will consider on 11 July before its second reading at its meeting.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of swearing in Russian citizenship instead of formally signing documents on 6 June during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The members of Parliament have incorporated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the revocation of the decision to grant citizenship to those who have subsequently been convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, public incitement to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (article 205.2, paragraph 2), as well as the hijacking of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is related to terrorism (article 211, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, the logic of the bill was that, by issuing citizenship documents, a person signed a promise to comply with Russian law - by embarking on the path of extremism, he broke that promise.
In April, the draft law was submitted to the State Duma by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev (“Uniform Russia”), Gennady Zuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (“Just Russia”) and the Speaker of DG Viacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies accepted it on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Building and Legislation approved the text of the bill for a second reading, but it has now been reworked.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will take the oath of office.
Previously, parliamentarians had intended to describe the procedure directly in the Law on Citizenship of the Russian Federation, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the State coat of arms and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event was to take place, a list of places where the coat of arms of the Russian Federation could be placed, is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, the offices of the heads of State of the entities, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, the heads of the federal executive, etc.
Most likely, it could also be a registry.
The solemn oath will be given to those wishing to acquire Russian citizenship after the officials have checked their documents.
But the Russian passport will be obtained only after the swearing-in, as follows from the finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not the age of 14.
The rule remains that persons with disabilities or limited legal capacity, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath themselves, will be exempted from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt “others” from this procedure.
The updated bill also lays down a special procedure for the admission to Russian of Ukrainian citizens who are considered Russian speakers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting the relevant application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application would need to be handed over to Russian officials.
A waiver of “foreign” nationality, as at present, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the control of the individual”.
A corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among them the first Vice-Speaker of DG Ivan Melnikov (CRPF), Natalia Poclonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all “One Russia”).
I think a lot of you know it's not realistic to get a certificate from Ukraine, it's just impossible.
Consequently, a great many people are waiting for their fate to be decided about Russian citizenship, explained the previous day the head of the State Building and Legislation Committee of the Duma, Pavel Krascheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the holding of certain posts for foreigners would not apply to those who had renounced “other” citizenship in writing and had deposited an old passport with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but “for reasons beyond its control” he had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from holding municipal posts and from being recruited to work in facilities and organizations whose activities relate to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit from another country may not become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Council of Federation.
It is planned that the law will enter into force on 1 September 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws will be ready.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective.
The present iteration of history is nostalgically reminiscent of the glorious days of the characters in the 1980s; of the age of grunge in the 1990s (about the time when distinguished masters David Wayne and Michael Schwalter made a comedy of the sketch "State" for MTV); and of themselves - that is, the year 2001 - before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Pauler and Paul Rudd, moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, she seems an anachronistic.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of absurdistic humor (including the original story of the talking can of vegetables that H. John Benjamin said).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually disturbed children who have only reached the age of majority; thus, the inability to return to the joke becomes part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", where adults play already adults, has less profound emotional roots, and its parody is more random and includes riffs from the stalker films of the 1990s, like "Rooks swinging the cradle."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991".
Many of the plot moves are the same.
The kind-hearted Coop (Showalter), now a writer, has yet to obtain reciprocity from Cathy (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't broken up with his virginity.
And there's also a crazy and vile conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Shawalter), now instigated by George W. Bush Sr. (a trial parody performed by Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the departure from it.
It's particularly funny to see a young Rudd singing a song by Matt Dillon from Single, whose character, Andy's former big man, looks like an old man now.
To bring success to this franchise could be accidental madness like the recursive series Seven Up until it reaches what I think would be its logical conclusion: "A Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the last scene the entire company would go to the movie premiere of "A Hot American Summer".
Comrade Detective in the Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: the Cold War memories of the Americans, the Explosion Blonde, or even the Flash, with its images of the East-West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Reese Thomas, depicts a television film: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheistism and the Marxist-Leninian route.
The main roles of Gregor and Joseph's idealist are played by Florin Pierrecic Jr. and Cornelius Street, and their dialogues in English by Channing Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
That's a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (the police spend time watching a chess game, how Americans could watch football).
A team of famous voices behind the frame, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Sevinyi, makes it fun to play "seek a voice."
But Comrade Detective is so clinging to the truth of a clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - that often looks like her.
Six long episodes are long, and it's not often funny.
If we could make it shorter, Comrade Detective could do better with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, two fat people sit in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
The image of an image of a Communist viewer says that Western culture can make a fatty out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund for the Russian Super Bowl football match between Spartacus and Locomotive will be about 30 million roubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL), Sergei Pratkin, at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFL, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that, to date, there were few tickets left for the match.
The Spartacus-Lokomotive match will be held on Friday, 14 July, at 9.30 p.m.
According to TASS, Spartacus is an active champion of the Russian Federation, and Locomotive is the owner of the National Cup.
Two young Uphimians cleaned the furniture shop for 200,000 rubles.
The other day, a 37-year-old Uphimian with a furniture firm approached the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the shop, causing serious damage to its production.
Thieves were mined with tools worth almost 200,000 rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, hydraulics, a winch.
The security forces began to search for the criminals and soon came out to the residents of the Bashkortostan Beziveshen district, friends of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the accomplices broke into the premises of the company, broke into the front door and removed the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold stolen equipment to the first car service they ever saw.
They had already been prosecuted for theft and the law enforcement officers had been able to recover only some of the stolen instruments.
State Department commented on Medvedev's remarks about Russian-US relations.
The US and Russia must be able to work together.
Such a statement was made by the spokesman for the State Department, Heather Nauert, in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, on the relations between the two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government stated that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US ended the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on those words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were at a “low level”, but noted that there was a need to look for “areas of interaction”.
"Look at the truce in southwest Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the US and Russia," says the diplomat RIA News.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Premier that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The draft law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK was signed by US President Donald Trump on the previous Wednesday.
He acknowledged, however, that the document had failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior grew roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior-Dior Joaillerie has added to the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
There were five new rings and three necklaces on velvet ribbons.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line produced two new rings and a pendant of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds made in glyptus (hand carving on stone) and pavage techniques dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the home.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by the roses that Christian Dior grew at his estate in Granville, and by the Paris Gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found the perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia.
US President Donald Trump strongly criticized Congress members.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president tweeted.
Donald Trump signed the law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK the previous day.
In particular, Russian banks and energy companies will be affected.
The White House subsequently circulated a presidential statement in which it stated that the law would not allow the US to make profitable deals and would bring the Russian Federation, China, and North Korea even closer.
Belarusian businessman refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
A businessman from Belarus, Victor Prokopenja, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (BNB) for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to the BCF with the intention “to focus on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move would be "the best investment of time," despite the investment attractiveness of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenja became the main claimant for the purchase of a unit of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of NorvikBank consortium Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guzeriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Peter Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
Sberbank became one such financial institution, apart from the TSB and the Vnesheconombank.
Novak gave me the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
The Russian Ministry of Energy has identified the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, explained the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in Krasnodar province.
A truck hit an electric transmission line, resulting in the shutdown of Cuban and related Crimean networks.
Power failures in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The specialists corrected the malfunction within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the Blackout could have been caused by an abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and declining inflation have caused rumours of a possible rise to fade.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain slow, leaving interest rates unchanged among the rising pressure on family income.
Experts from the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 against 2 in favour of maintaining rates at 0.25 per cent, with fewer members this month in favour of an increase in the rate because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, and warned that pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to around 3 per cent in the fall.
However, the bank warned that higher rates in the next few years would be needed to control brexitis-induced inflation, and stated that borrowing costs might have to be raised more than expected in financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the huge economic development package launched a year ago because of the brexite.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan, under which it provides cheap loans to banks, although it has announced that it will now have to provide another £15 billion – up to £115 billion.
In the rate decision protocol, the bank said, “In line with the major projections of the MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) remains slow in the near future, while pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption.”
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that a “some tightening of fiscal policy” would be needed to halt inflation, at a “slightly larger” level than expected by markets.
Markets are currently predicting their first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all promotions would be “slow” and “restricted.”
The bank ' s projections for this and next year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The bank kept its forecast stable at 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After this news, Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent to US$1.31 and 0.4 per cent to Euro1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent disappointing growth rate weakened the expectation of an increase; GDP then rose by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the bank representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice at households hit by high inflation and very small wage increases: according to the bank, pressure would increase before falling.
The Bank added that financial policy “can't prevent” the earnings of the poor in the next few years, but expects that salaries will be “significantly” restored by the end of his three-year prognosis.
The economy is also driven by growing demand for British goods, driven by a low pound rate that offsets some of the lower consumption costs.
The decision was made a year after last August’s rates were reduced to 0.25 percent after the shocking outcome of the EU exit referendum, which resulted in the pound’s fall.
According to the bank, it is likely to take four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last rate decision, there was an increase in the noise surrounding the anticipated rate rise, as inflation was increasingly pushing already under pressure households: three committee members asked for a 0.5 percent increase in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent, from 2.9 per cent in July, although according to the bank the fall was expected and again compensated in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher figure than the planned 2% is entirely the result of a low pound rate.
Andrew Montlake, director of Korea Mortgage Brokers, said, “If we consider the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again, as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end to the year.
The market seems particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as credit refinancing, often with no commission, and with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
The public health service will prescribe a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” HIV-prevention drug after the battle in the High Court on the funding of the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREC), a pre-sex pill that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year probation period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's High Court ruling, which claimed that the National Health Service had the option to pay for the ESP, despite her claims that it should be funded by the local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was described as “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and by the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT), it was called a turning point.
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, the VP clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and more will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREC) is a course for HIV drugs that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
Research has shown that EPP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When you take PET before you have sex in a person, there's enough certain drugs to prevent infection with HIV.
Such medications can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender persons and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender persons and those whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is being contained by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live and are assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest Venereal Clinic participating in the program.
The program will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England signed a drug supply contract this week after an international tender.
The study is designed to assess all the capabilities of the EPP by collecting clinical data on who the target audience of the drug is, on its absorption and use on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and reinforce the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National AIDS Control Authority), stated: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
ECP, if properly targeted at people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Beginning in September, people at risk for HIV will be able to access a new, new tool from the National Health Service in England, the use of which a person can control without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to improvements in many or many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Ian Greene, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first thing that needs to be done is to ensure that the test goes forward quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk of HIV is forgotten.
Now that we are supplied with an experimental BEP drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said, “We very much welcome the start of the EPP test, which has been greatly delayed by months of delays and delays on the part of the government.”
The evidence shows how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of the BEP.
It is now important that the test be deployed throughout the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk of HIV and move us a step further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution on support for the Tatarstan-Russian Treaty
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positive form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic and expresses the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, it “has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
It should be recalled that the agreement between Moscow and Kazanyu, in force since 24 July 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On 11 July, members of the State Council of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only entity in the Federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one known as the president.
In Russia, difficulties were encountered in obtaining international driving permits.
There is a shortage of international driving permits (IDPs) for the IGDD units.
In order to obtain such rights, it is necessary to wait for a few weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who wish to go abroad in their car or rent it.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains controversial.
The purpose of the IDP was to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national permit, since the information was explained in five languages.
The requirements of international rights are contained in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In fact, however, it depends on a particular police or rental office: some demand IDPs and some have sufficient national rights.
In order to be safe, drivers do receive international rights, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the Convention (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with the forms in almost all units of the HYDD, reports Commersant, which has conducted research in several regions.
In Moscow, for example, the IHDD units simply do not issue stamps, and the forms have been missing for four months.
You can make an appointment on the public service website, but it's already in line until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain IDPs “for technical reasons” without going into detail, and in Samara province it is honestly said that there are no forms, and the situation is similar in other cities.
Many Moscowmen have already faced the problem, and social media reports are becoming more frequent:
Irina Burmistrov: "Well, guess why you can't get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, 'cause all the HBHS departments ran out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question to knowledgeable people!"
We need to get international rights right now.
In Moscow, there is always a long way to go, and there are no tickets at all (but there is a button but can't give a ticket).
It's like a public service portal shows that Sp. Time is full of shit.
Have you ever tried getting in another city?
Will it work?
As explained by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for international driving licence forms have changed and new forms are being supplied to State Motor Vehicle Inspection units.
This may be linked to the deficit, but it is not clear what changes are being made, but this has not been previously reported.
Blanci buys the MVF ' s Special Purpose Centre for Road Safety (SDSC) and then delivers them to the units of the HYDD.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with the Gosnak AO: almost 200,000 IDP forms were produced in 2014-2015, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016 and 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with the First Printing Court for 70,000 forms.
There's a theory that the CSN just didn't have time to tender in time, which caused the deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: the crisis has led many people to travel to cheaper Asian countries — China, Thailand, and so on — rather than to Europe.
It is not clear what rights are taken there, so people are being re-insured, so there is a grueling demand for international crusts.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to take an examination to prove their qualifications.
The proposal was made by the Ministry of Transport.
The new International Driving Permit (IDP) has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Ukraine’s Minister of Justice, Pavel Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
That's what he said in an interview on Friday, August 4th.
No self-respecting international company will even put a baltic or nut in there because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan, in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
“I mean, I am deeply convinced that there is virtually no prospect of this project,” Petrenko said.
He added that he found Russia unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot properly build smaller objects.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
“So I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so shortsighted to join this project,” the official pointed out.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the building of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerchensk bank, a large-scale assembly of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed: it is closed at a height of 45 metres from the base of the structure.
“On a one-time basis the bridge builders have prepared a rail arch for installation on the fairway supports”, reported the project information centre.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and Krasnodar province.
In Spain, an official who had been absent from work for 10 years was dismissed.
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the public service) should the chief of Spanish officials, Carlos Recio, have?
The permanent walk went on for 10 long years.
Mr. Recio was, however, dismissed.
But not his immediate superior.
There's a lot of things that don't happen in the bureaucrat world.
It seems that the residents have long been used to all the "people's services" stuff.
And yet officials are always able to surprise those whose taxes they live well on.
This time, the "sense" came from Spain.
There, an archivist at Valencia Carlos Recio managed to stay out of work for ten years.
In doing so, he was paid regularly.
And all the solids are 50,000 euros a year.
And now Mr. Recio's wonderful times are over.
He was dismissed by the Valencian legislature.
The investigation revealed that a vicious truant came to the office every morning at 0700 hours to check in on the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he showed up at work at 4:00 to report back to the system that he had left.
It's been ten years.
It has also been revealed that all his free time was spent drawing comic books at home.
Members of the Valencian legislature are now considering how to punish Mr. Recio's immediate superior, who could not have been unaware of how to “actively work” in his place of work.
Judges are offered protection from presidents.
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (CHR), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has drawn up proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes that the powers of the presidents of the courts be limited and that they be elected.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRC wishes to introduce special districts which will not be linked to the administrative division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit proposals within the framework of a presidential mandate.
HRC has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
The HRC conducted this work on behalf of Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the council.
At a meeting with the council on 8 December 2016, some cases of judicial arbitrariness were discussed, as well as problems of public control in places of detention (see “IU” of 9 December).
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals that deal both with the independence of the judiciary and the detection of judicial errors and with the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of court presidents to increase the independence of the remaining judges.
If the candidate for the post of judge has successfully passed the competition and has received the support of the judiciary, the HRC is of the view that the president of the court should submit him for appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to allocate cases to judges.
This can be done by experts, by means of a specially written computer program.
The HRC also considers that the President is not entitled to “prejudicate the results of a judge's qualification, initiate disciplinary proceedings against him or her, and decide on additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to “the election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves” and to “ensure their powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation”.
All the presidents of the courts (from the Republic to the District) are now appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRC proposes to re-organize appeals and cassations in the ordinary courts.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative division into the Russian Federation.
The HRC states that “it is necessary to ensure that separate courts of appeal and cassation are not organized at the level of the regional courts in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts”.
The experts are based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
They have “judicial districts” which do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but which thus guarantee greater independence from regional officials who are hampered by the use of “telephone rights”.
The HRC proposes that the magistrates be strengthened by people's assessors to deal with certain “classes of civil and administrative cases” with their participation.
For example, deprivation of parental rights, reinstatement at work, protection of honour and dignity, deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"It's just our suggestions," explained HRC member, retired Constitutional Court judge Tamara Morchashkov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate referred not only to the HRC but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
The armed forces (among the co-authors, the Office of the Procurator-General and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation) still have time to carry out their task.
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, the President of the Russian Armed Forces, Vyacheslav Lebedev, is due before 1 September.
Living a high life: semi-storeys and crafty designers have turned this little apartment into a big house in Earls Court.
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the ground floor of a pretty Queen Anne model house, and in favour of a new design, it says that Joan didn't pack her things and move again.
“I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger square,” Joan says.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were just as high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price on the same day.”
Since the first look, a 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Originally, it was an apartment with one bedroom of complex design – to get into the bedroom, it had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and floor space to squeeze out the maximum benefit from the bountiful ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my demand," she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural design studio, Duke & Shed, to use the ceilings of 12.5 feet high and create a home that would not only be a successful project but would be worth Joan's life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-storey where one could stand at full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the brift.
“Work with steel structures is very complex,” he explains.
“We had to place the premises so that they were one above the other, and we did not have to bend.
It was not simply necessary to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they would be at the right height and allow the use of rooms from above and below.”
This decision allowed Erfan to have two full-sized rooms one above the other in space -- and a lot more interesting.
From the semi-storey through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius", a view of the gorgeous living room below is opened.
Mirror furniture with gold trim, silver accents, and vintage lighting from Serge Muy set the design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding visual appearance, width, and light.
The short corridor is surrounded by mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror shield looks like a window in the other room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinets are used to store all of Joan's dishes.
To create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block itself in the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the folding kitchens.
The unique thing about this kitchen is that it's a moving door up like a garage.
“The engineering art was involved here,” Erfan tells of the steel-reinforced fibre-fibrous shield door.
"It has a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Due to the prudent use of space and storage facilities, Joan obtained an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved layout.
“In the end, floor space is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your real estate is worth,” Erfan says.
"To put it bluntly, the real estate agent will enter and make calculations based on the floor area."
Here, they were able to increase the area of the floor by using quality materials that provide a shade of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the house,” Erfan says.
“No one falls in love with the wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't hurt the strings of our hearts."
This is evidence that, through good design and increased metering, an apartment can turn from something ordinary to something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a cultural policy commission
The Russian Government has approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The relevant decree has been published on the Government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also draft a cultural policy strategy, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
A deputy chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation has been appointed as head of the commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, approved in 2016 a plan for the implementation of the State cultural policy strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a common cultural space and cultural heritage, and will contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries decreased to a minimum of eight years
Consumer price increases in G20 countries have declined to the lowest in eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent, with lower values in October 2009, when the price increase index was 1.7 per cent.
Rossstat previously reported a 0.1 per cent decline in the Russian consumer price index.
The agency thus recorded the first week of deflation in 2017.
The inflation rate in Russia is estimated by the Ministry of Finance to be 4.1 per cent.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs, however, believes that the target has already been achieved - the figure is 4 per cent according to this agency.
Putin warned against illegally cutting out the Baykal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donska, noted that a bill had been drafted previously.
It allows logging during fire-fighting, and the government plans to receive it in the fall.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be monitored to ensure that, during the felling process, “everything is not passed out”.
Donska noted that the bill involved monitoring by MES and oversight agencies.
Media: U.S.A. fighters negotiate with Donbass militia in secret from the command
Regular telephone calls have been established on the line of armed confrontation in Donbas.
Fighters on the opposing sides communicate on mobile phones all the time, and they don't know about it at headquarters.
The UPS and Donbass militia have established cell phone communication in secret from their high command.
This is reported by Country.ua on 4 August, referring to members of the military operation in Donbas.
According to the publication, unit commanders know the names of their counterparts on the other side of the front and communicate with them on a daily basis by telephone.
Communication is not domestic at all: commanders are trying to reach some kind of “tactical arrangement”.
Often the result of such conversations is a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists learned of cases in which an officer received congratulations on his birthday from outside the front line, from his formal enemy.
The U.S.A. and the DNR and LNR fighters have been sitting in trenches on the boundary line since spring 2014, when Ukraine launched a military operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was outraged by the blocking of UNSSC allegations of attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation
In the Russian foreign service, we are outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives, which block the press statements by the United Nations to condemn the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
It was recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus was the third time in a month that a terrorist group, Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, prohibited in the Russian Federation), and Faylah Al-Rahman, had fired mortar shells at the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus.
Bearing in mind that the international community is unanimous in the designation of “Nusra” as a terrorist organization, and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council call for opposition to this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation noted that “it would seem, of course, that the terrorist acts of Nusra should be universally condemned unconditionally and decisively, and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions”.
However, as the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine pointed out in the Department, “for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of the objections, covering up the alleged lack of information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft statement to the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of those delegations.
“The most outrageous thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to commit further provocations and acts of terrorism, gives them a sense of impunity,” said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and added that “it would not be desirable for these barbarians to be convinced that someone in the Security Council is with them”.
Vladimir Putin was in favour of limiting the number of unplanned business checks
Russian President Vladimir Putin, during the meeting on investment projects in the Far East, stated that the number of unscheduled checks on entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned number, as well as the need to limit the duration of inspections to 10 days.
“Unscheduled inspections are usually carried out without appropriate agreement with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2 to 3 per cent are coordinated with the Public Prosecutor's Office and everything else is done independently”, quotes the President of TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from removing servers and hard drives from businesses.
In addition, in the President ' s view, business associations should be entitled to defend the interests of their members in court.
“This, hopefully, will bring some benefits to business-related or business-related cases,” said the Head of State.
As IA reported, the moratorium on routine inspections is increasing the number of other types of business inspections.
In May, at the request of the Business Ombudsman under President Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, which revealed that there had actually been a substitution of routine checks by non-scheduled means (the proportion of those involved rose from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raiders (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent) and checks on citizens ' claims (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).

The brothers are fighting for an empire worth over $500 million.
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest empires in real estate, worth over $500 million, 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former director of Carlton's football club and developer Colin de Lucis lives in the Turak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a suit against him in the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still struggling to argue on the terms of divorce.
Together with her mother, Anna's brothers own 87 properties worth over half a billion dollars bought since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Luthis family's property list now includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Bank and Mount Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late Father Colin, whom Paul describes as the “major driving force and dominant person” of the De Lucis family, he owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one third.
According to the court, this means Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's property is 176 million.
The division of property and money became Paul's stumbling block.
"The section Colin proposed gives him, in my opinion, the best pieces of property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed reconciliation attempts, the first Supreme Court hearings were held.
The brothers are now arguing about who's going to control the existing business, from which Paul thinks Colin has expelled him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of mismanagement of certain facilities.
In the testimony Colin gave at the beginning of the trial, he said he hoped to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority," he wrote.
Court costs are rising as a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Kramer have been added to the case; both parties have engaged the most prominent lawyers, including King Allan Myers, and the best cooks.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they've been running dairy bars and gastronomics, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
With financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood that opened Colin's first family jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last year of high school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their property to their sons without conflict.
"Louiji often told me he didn't want the brothers to know about the court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer in the De Lucis group; Colina says Mark got $10 million when he left the business and Luke got $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their division."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL board of directors and, according to Eddie McGir's 2015 biographies, best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded with a text message stating that, since the case had not yet been tried, “I really have nothing to say”.
"I'm very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and talk about our family's name in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin testified that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding, "still hoping for a resolution of the conflict."
On Friday, that hope seemed to have dissipated.
"Our case will soon be decided by the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of staff of Trump plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
Then he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in the hope of keeping the Chief calm.
That's what reporter Josh Dosey said.
"At a meeting held by the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, with the management of the office on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: poor channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that information should go through him - paper or briefing - because the president would be better at making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is perfectly correct, but others have already failed in trying to control Trump by tracking his information.
President Trump's relationship with television began decades ago, and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair publicity of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received fair publicity in publications that could be persuaded,” said Sam Nanberg, a former campaign adviser, in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in Politico that "in the words of six former members of the electoral staff, in order to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control, you had to make sure that there was a constant stream of praise in the information he received personally."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the election staff know something we don't know, for example, that if it wasn't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets Trump hasn't published.
If his staff kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to keep Trump from adding oil to the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their subpoenas by providing Trump with material, reliable or not, that confirms their views.
Politico, which is the story, wrote in May about the tendency of the advisors to keep the president in doubt.
Here is one example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"The current and former Trump employees say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This was the case in late February, when someone leaked to the president a printout of an article from GottNews.com, the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Welsh was accused of being "standin' behind the leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he hasn't presented specific facts, or that in the past he's been launching false accusations and then dropping them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that the then Chief of Staff, Raines Pribus, and Staff Secretary Rob Porter "tryed to build a system to control and document the flow of paper that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same thing.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has impulsive nature, and his associates are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Prosecutor's Office is fighting HIV-dissociatives
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the ruling of the Kalininsky Reed of Tumeni, which dropped the criminal case against a local woman who had died of HIV from a young daughter.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was HIV-dissociative and refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of her responsibility in connection with her reconciliation with the father.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be allowed to go unpunished in order not to set a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case against a woman resident of Tumeni was brought under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (cause of death by negligence) in April, following the death of her three-year-old daughter from HIV infection.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
“The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection”, was explained by the Prosecutor's Office of the Tyumen Region.
The criminal case was brought before the Kalininsky Rayde of Tumeni, who decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The request was made by the deceased girl's father, who explained that “simplicised the wife, had no complaints against her, made amends and apologized”.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office did not accept the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to dismiss the case be quashed and referred to a new hearing.
The girl died, and it's impossible to make up for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-positive mother refused to examine the baby and treat her with a dangerous infection, contrary to the recommendations of the doctors,” reported to the press service of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In the view of the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise other HIV-dissidents would follow suit.
As reported at the Tumen AIDS Centre, about 12 children living with HIV in the Tyumensk region are now not receiving medical care because of the refusal of their parents.
“And this situation has already improved — during the year of the special group’s work, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat their children with HIV changed their mind — allowed them to diagnose, began taking medication,” said the spokesperson for the AIDS Centre, Elena Losheva.
She said that parents could not be affected by legislation and that, as a result, not all HIV-infected children could be found - mothers were prevented from examining them, hiding and running away from hospitals.
The Risks of HIV Dissidents
At the end of last year, peterburgian sociologists presented the results of the first study of the so-called HIV-dissident movement in Russia.
HIV-dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Medical practitioners and AIDS service activists in NCBs call such views anti-medical, and their distribution is considered to be a serious threat.
The gruesome photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Greek railway station in Khmelnitsky.
A fun company of drunk youths walked the bridge over the railway tracks, where a freight train was standing.
One of the friends had the idea of making a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, and they told FACTAM in the police communications sector in Khmelnitsky province.
The guy started coming down from a bridge to a train, but due to his indiscretion, he got caught in the power line and was electrocuted instantly.
Fortunately, this incident came to the attention of the station manager, who immediately called the emergency room.
Before the arrival of the doctor, the victim was moved to a safe place and then hospitalized to the burn ward of Khmelnitska Regional Clinical Hospital.
Males were diagnosed with 1 to 2 degrees of body burns.
His condition is now assessed by doctors as stable.
The law enforcement authorities recall that extreme selfies on the roofs of multi-storeys, bridges, and moving transport have become increasingly popular in recent times.
The police encourage people to be vigilant and to prevent such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the oceans to exist in ancient Venus.
There could be oceans on ancient Venus.
That was the assumption made by French scientists.
Experts created a computer model that demonstrated the formation of water on the surface of planets, writing Science News.
It turns out that at the beginning of Venus's history, oceans were formed, with 10% more water than they are now on Earth.
Previously, "Arguments of the Week" had written that, according to scientists' hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
In the course of their research, foreign experts concluded that the water facility was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured in a shooting in a park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured in the shooting, transmitting the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where there were a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them took a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the intruders could not be seen because they had all but their eyes closed.
Another was provided with medical treatment, after which he was released.
The third wounded is a minor, no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park Hill is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured in an attempt to leave the premises.
Louna rock band will present a new album in Barnaul.
The Luna rock band concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
The musicians will present their new album, "The Wild New World", which has become one of the most expected releases of the year.
The group is preparing a concept show that will be the most vivid in the band's concert history.
"The Wild New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is linked to the famous O. Huxley Anti-Utopia novel "Oh a Wonderful New World".
The new songs do not retell the book, but they tell of a society that lives by the law of anti-utopia, "blindly believing propaganda and imposed values."
The band was helped to raise money to record the album: more than 1,200 people supported the project on Planeta.ru's website.
She released her first album, "Do Louna Louna" in 2010.
Two years later, the album "Time X" was released, and in 2013 the album "We Are Luna" (2013) was recorded.
In the autumn of 2015, Luna's band performed a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the "Sings of Peace" program.
In the group Lusine Gevorkian (Vocal), Vitaly Demidenco (bas-guitar), Ruben Kazarian (guitar), Sergei Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzboursky (barabans).
The concert will be held at the Barnaul Club of Faraon on October 17, 7.00.
Ticket price: 1,200 to 2,600 roubles.
Louna is one of the requested bands on the Russian rock scene.
It was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The group has won a number of nominations for the "Damn Dozen" hit parade.
The Gypsies crossed the moat and returned to the street of the millionaires.
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midland are once again in conflict with the determined Gypsies, who have overcome the moats dug by the municipal authorities to retake the field near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordered by the wealthy Sollihallah street, which was dubbed "millionaire street".
By bringing horses, babies, and many houses on wheels, they returned after being expelled as late as May, and were not prevented by a moat dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactful company found a breach in the defensive structures and squeezed its vehicles through a section that was left uninsured to leave space for the trail.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Sollihalla, saying that he was “incompetent to solve the problem.”
An anonymous local woman said, "They came here on Monday night after being driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by."
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because it is completely incapable of solving the problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they got kicked out, and now they're back.
There were more gypsies last night, and maybe more today.
“The Municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term court orders to protect their parks”, she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying municipal tax, and the municipality can't even stop it.”
A local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and here we are, please, continuing this attack."
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse plowing on the meadow.”
The representative of the municipality of Sollihalla said, “We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and we are cooperating with the Sollihal police; we are taking the necessary legal action to expel them as soon as possible”.
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by telephone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea is operated by the New Light Champagne Wine Plant.
The “New Light Champagne Wine Plant” of the Republic of Crimea has decided to act by transforming the Champagne Wine Plant “New Light” into the OAO, following an order from the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anuhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in Crimea's state ownership.
The registered capital of the joint stock company will be 595.5 million roubles and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if funds were not available to upgrade the plant within the next three years, the plant would be at risk of being stopped.
The wear and tear of property, plant and equipment is in the range of 60-70 per cent.
In order to modernize the enterprise, 1.2 billion roubles are needed. Due to its organizational and legal nature, it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of the income to the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
“To get money from the owner is problematic, to talk about attracting loans from large credit organizations,” said the heads of the Crimea Mincelhos Sergei Petlin in April this year.
The Crimea Parliament included the enterprise in the privatization forecast for 2017.
It was suggested that it be held and tendered.
The Interfax source in Crimea authorities estimated the possible sale value of the business at $40 million, the investor's investment in modernization at another $30 million.
The New Light in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8 per cent compared to 2015 levels, to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New Light intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lion Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in his newly acquired estate.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Suburban third graders destroyed over 40 headstones.
The officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Department in Nizhgorod oblast identified the citizens who had destroyed 46 tombstones in the cemetery of the town of Lyskovo.
The third - grade students were the perpetrators.
The first allegation that graves had been damaged by unknown persons was received by the Russian Department of Internal Affairs for the Lyskov district as early as 27 June.
A total of 24 people approached the police on this matter.
As a result, criminal proceedings were instituted under article 244 of the Criminal Code, entitled “Deterioration, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
The investigation resulted in the identification of suspects by the police and the identification of two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the monuments fall, which prompted them to commit hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone with regard to NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy warned NGOs that owned rescue vessels in the Mediterranean Sea that they would not be able to continue working unless they complied with the new regulations governing their activities.
“If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities,” said Interior Minister Mario Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
The warning to Minnity came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had been working for only one year, refused to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartozio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain a top priority, so we very much regret that we cannot continue our search and rescue activities now," says the organization's statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the charges now made after we have gathered all the information and we can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa ship belonging to the Jugend Rettet since October.
His crew is suspected of taking migrants on board with their lifeboats, who were sent directly to them by traffickers, and of allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as alleged in the charges, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in the area, more from humanitarian zeal than from any other motive.
The Code of Conduct assumes mainly that the YVV vessels will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the “Save the Children”, the Maltese MOAS and the “Pro-Activa Open hug” from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new regulations unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they did not entail any “significant change or interference” with its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minnity said that the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last days we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict."
The Russian Federation authorities have recently significantly stepped up their policy on the Libyan track, and the delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have been involved in visits to Moscow.
The head of the Russian Contact Group for the Intra-Livian Settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Deng, told "I".
The contact group on Libya, which you are chairing, is hardly known.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine, everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Her activities are overseen by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delemhanov.
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma, Viacheslav Volodin.
The start of the group was the detention in Libya of a Russian tanker, the Mechanic Chebotarev (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board).
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was established and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How come you're the one who took over?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been approached to lead the work of the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the Chebotarev Mechanic.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict, and with Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government is based, led by Faiz Saraj.) and Tobruk (a parliament that opposes the Government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls eastern Libya.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Libya Vice Prime Minister), we were able to quickly agree to release Russian sailors.
It was then agreed to establish a contact group to make better use of those contacts.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I wish to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate ourselves with any of the parties to the conflict; we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group, and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
The contact group now includes five persons.
Among them are people with experience in the security forces, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include in the regional team the representatives of the RA Institute of the Middle East.
No one of our staff is permanently present in Libya; this is not yet necessary.
Are there Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are untrue.
But your contact group has ex-military members...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
Like when we visit hot spots.
Or such closed cities as Misrata (where militia groups are based, which played a role in overthrowing Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi in 2011 and which have increased markedly in subsequent years).
We arrived in Misrata in January this year.
We were scared, told it was all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who was responsible for what the rumours were about, what was really the role of Islamists.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the forces that were involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken away from militants of the banned “Islamic State” in Russia.
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to verify that they were the ones who played a decisive role in the destruction of IGs in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these services to himself.
And what did you come to?
The Islamic State in Libya didn't win Haftar?
He didn't do it.
Haftar was operating on another front, Benghazi.
IGs in Sirte were fought by structures subordinate to the Government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we've invited the people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they came -- the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was received by the Federation Council, Duma, MIDE and Rosgvardiya.
You, as we understand it, are present in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the moods of local elites and warlords.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire arrangements that were reached in late July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or, again, as has happened many times in the past, agreements will be broken, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
The fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting was a good signal for us, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, the two leaders have been very negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
Moscow’s active support for Haftar is often written and spoken of, and many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and Khaftar was on that very day on board a Russian aircraft carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But Misrata wasn't believed in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people to come to us today."
But our task is precisely to show that we do not support only Haftar; we are engaged in dialogue with all key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have been in touch.
Does understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level make it easier for him to study twice in the USSR?
And by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he knows Russian, it's very relative.
But the fact that he learned from us makes it easier to have a dialogue with him, of course.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who were either in Russia or still in the Soviet Union.
And here they are speaking Russian very well.
And reaching out to Russia, feeling a little nostalgic about it.
Do you consider it likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya would be lifted as soon as possible?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
Of course they are, but, as I said, we are not taking sides in this conflict, and we would not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be about equal.
With regard to the arms embargo, Libyans have consistently called for the Russian Federation to contribute to its lifting.
The constitution-making process is now well under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections must take place, as was also mentioned at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If elections are held and legitimate power is finally elected (and none of the parties now has such status), the question of lifting the arms embargo can be raised at the United Nations.
It is pointless and dangerous to raise this issue now; it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
There was news in the media the other day that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners by using its ties with Libyans in this situation?
How realistic is it, for example, that Haftar troops will take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transporting immigrants to Europe?
That's a very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia’s support, because Moscow has a dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj and Misurata and the south of the country.
Tribes in southern Libya play a major role in this matter, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it a matter of Southerners stopping the flow of migrants on long-distance approaches?
So, on a conditional basis, you turned back the buses that Nigerian migrants were taking?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in seeing these flows continue.
We hope to help bring southerners together in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see a consensus on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The Head of Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered to be an Islamist supporter of the country ' s Sharia.
How radical is he?
Would that not be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give you my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but it is his position that Libya must be a perfectly normal country, a moderate Islamic, open world.
And he is also active in the fight against terrorists.
How does he have such a reputation?
It was created by countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where the legislative, executive and judicial branches are located.
There's a national oil corporation, a national bank, and other government structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
And we mixed up all the maps and started to communicate actively with both Tripoli and Tobrooke.
We are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosneft has entered into a cooperation agreement with the Libyan State Oil Company - NOC.
The director of NOC, Mustafa Sanallah, with whom Rosnefti Head Igor Sechin made a deal, was himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'll resell it.
What other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
Plans to re-sign Muammar Qadhafi contracts.
These include previous agreements in the transport field (rail construction), energy (electricity) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, as in the case of Iran, is this about the oil-for-service scheme?
I don't know what the pattern is, I don't deal directly with these issues.
In fact, Russia’s economy in Libya is not the main one.
We are essentially in the peacekeeping business there.
Our main concern is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya is no longer a propitious environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, that is the main objective: to help the Libyan people and to expel terrorists from there.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that, to date, none of the Russians and other countries of the former USSR were there.
He said he had about 50,000 phone records of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya) and no Russian speech.
Which States are these fighters from?
I wouldn't want to go into those details.
Then let's put it another way.
How many of the Islamist fighters in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are virtually no Libyans, not more than 5% of them.
The rest are from here.
Could Moscow hold intra-Lebanese talks like Paris?
There are plans.
We have been engaged in intensive negotiations with Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have indicated their willingness to come again to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say right now.
Several visits are yet to take place, and I hope that the timing and venue of the talks will be clarified.
At the Czech Museum, the philanthropists raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy.
In the Moscow Museum of Melikhovo, the nine-year-old boy Sasha Mazola, who has a CDC, brain hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a special treadmill on August 5 as a gift.
A useful presentation is given to Sasha by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, Oksana Kosareva, and the Director of the Konstantin Bobkov Museum.
The money for the simulator was collected during the charity marathon "Don't tire of doing good" that took place in Melikhov on July 15, Chekov Memorial Day.
The day before the marathon at the museum, Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino, Czech District, received a letter saying, "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd love to get a treadmill as a gift to make my legs strong, and I'd learn to walk a little."
And Sasha's dream came true!
After the performance, the concert post cryptum, a famous pianist and well-deserved artist from Russia, Alexander Gindin, will perform a maurri from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Vosnasskaya Davyd Desert, the callers of Ilya Drosdichin's workshop, the students of the P.I. Chaykovsky Moscow Conservatory and the Russian Gnesinsky Academy, and the artists of the Melikhova Theatre "Chekhova Studio".
Visitors were auctioned, a book fair was organized and souvenir products with a marathon logo were donated.
Melihovo Museum took the initiative to make 15 July Chekhov Memorial Day a single day of charity in all the Museums of Moscow.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevska in Zhitomir oblast near the local football stadium shot several times at the youths who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angry with the noise, reported to FACTAM in the communications department of the Zhitomir region police.
The man then entered a cafe nearby.
He had a conflict in the building, during which a man fired rubber bullets, injuring a visitor.
The 34-year-old victim has been provided with the necessary medical care and his life is not at risk.
Police and ambulances arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by that time.
The law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a device taken off rubber bullets that's been sent to forensics.
Criminal proceedings under article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code have been initiated.
A person may be sentenced to 3 to 7 years ' imprisonment.
Let us recall that in Kiev, a shooting attack took place on the night of 28 July in Lukianovka, in the vicinity of Tatarskaya Street.
Michel Carter's conviction for the reports that prompted Conrad Roy's suicide.
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for inciting her boyfriend Conrad Roy to suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months in prison and another five years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers stated that both she and Roy were suffering from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the judgment standing up, with her hands pressed and her eyes lowered.
"By her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She didn't admit responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his view, her “age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a noticeable impact on her actions”.
The Prosecutor read out the statements of Roy Lynn Roy's mother, which said, "No day has passed when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I handle it - I'm trying to support his sisters despite all the pain that's going to stay with us forever," it says.
Sister Roy Kamdin Roy said that she was indistinguishable about the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"The man who's been with me ever since I was born is the pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would make it an offence to advise a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The incident caught the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been prompted to commit suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife." She wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and, "You just need to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted attention with Roy's death, and he banned her from talking to the press to keep her from getting what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published a separate opinion in the Los Angeles Times, which stated, "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Yevgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a high-fly bird."
One of the best basketball players in the U.S. Single League, 33-year-old Keith Langford, left the U.N.A.S.
The departure of the American defender Izvestom commented on by the President of UNIX Evgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision on family matters, told Yevgeny Bogachev.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I've decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons in the UNICs, and in each match he played a high-level, 100% high-level game.
So I let him go like a high-fly bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and play.
Keith Langford played the club for three years, winning the silver of the United League 2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he won the Euroleague season's most successful player.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This is the second result since 2004 when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to win the award more than once.
Langford will shortly sign a contract with the Chinese Shenzhen, informing Eurohoops.
An American is expected to enter into a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star in July to join the Chinese championship.
Previously, the Chinese CBA moved to the ex-central Panatinaicos by Jannis Burusis.
A sunburned tourist from Moscow was evacuated by helicopter to Adigei
Adygean rescue workers today hijacked from the Republic’s mountainous region a moscular tourist who received the strongest sunburn.
The man was resting at the Fisht shelter, 1,600 metres high.
A 27-year-old tourist had high blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
Pre-diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescue workers were approached by the tour leader, who told them that the man had been burned on a camping trip.
Audi to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW announced that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW stated that the company believed that “there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, with European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – that were considering the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler announced on Thursday that he was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a review.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon dioxide regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that release diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to auto manufacturers of equipment that neutralizes diesel exhaust is also increasing and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of persuading powerful automakers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Companies try not to repeat Volkswagen's mistakes, which masked the use of so-called “damage devices”, which during testing could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the regulations, but were shut down under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen leaders have been convicted, while the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development team was arrested in Germany.
Former manager, Zackeo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, is therefore not immune to extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subjected to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded the investigation previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can cause serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is the source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s income.
In Astrahani, a visitor to the cafe paid false money.
The police received a report from a bank employee that a suspicious bill of 5,000 roubles had been discovered when the money received from the public catering point had been recalculated.
A study conducted at the Forensics Centre revealed that it was false.
According to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Astrahan region, one of the visitors to the coffee shop who bought the Shaurma was paid in banknotes.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with an authentication device.
Police officers are currently identifying persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a false Russian Central Bank ticket.
Such offences are punishable by up to 8 years ' imprisonment with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages the inhabitants of the Astrahan region to be attentive to financial transactions; it is recommended that trade workers install devices to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a hell of a planet where even iron can melt.
After first examining the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysics was surprised by its temperature, which can evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature makes the water in the planet's atmosphere glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b is one of the so-called hot Jupiters, which are gas giants in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas envelope is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and Southern France, but it is now feared that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has grown worse because of dry weather and insect diseases; this has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the CREEPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says, "Lavanda in Provence is indeed at risk because in recent years the plant has experienced the effects of climate change: the rains in the spring and especially in the autumn have been much smaller.
It affects the length of life of the lavender.
And there are little cicadas jumping through the leaves, carrying microbacteria; in very dry weather, there are a lot of them."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is much needed in perfumery and cosmetics.
Eric Shes says, "Instead of very long ears with many large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened, or absent.
That's why we have fewer parts containing ether oil."
The solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from soil, as well as spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
The Ambassador of Winter University 2019 met with the Red Sea students
The two-time world hockey champion, Ambassador Winter Universiade 2019, Alexander Semin met with beginners the day before and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of Winter University 2019, during the theme week for the puck hockey game.
Any visitor to the tent could have skated on an ice park.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games were organized to play the souvenir products of student games and warm up from the Federation of Aerobics.
Fifty schoolchildren attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much sports as possible and stressed that the most important part of the initial education was hard work and a huge desire to play hockey.
"It's great that there's a place in Krasnoyarsk like the tent of Winter University 2019, where beginners can directly ask questions to team coaches," said the champion.
We note that ambassadors of Winter University 2019 help to promote student sports and healthy lifestyles among the Red Sears.
The tent of the University will work throughout the summer season until September 25, and the press service of the Winter University College 2019 reports.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's comments.
The spokesman for the US State Department, Heather Nauert, commented at the briefing on the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, that there was a need to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
Such areas, she said, should be found to “enhance bilateral interaction”.
The Armistice Agreement on Syria was cited by Nowert as an example of such successful cooperation.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
At the same time, Nowert refused to comment on Medvedev’s claim about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia has said that, she certainly has the right to speak, but there is nothing more I can say on this subject,” said the representative of the State Department.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the chief executive of the Russian Federation Medvedev stated that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that US sanctions would be in effect for decades.
In addition, the prime minister, the American establishment, says Trump's "purely beaten."
The man who went missing in Moscow was found at a foreign home lost his memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very spicy circumstances: he left the car to go to the bathroom.
For seven days, acquaintances and locals searched for him unsuccessfully.
And there was Shamil at a stranger's house in Ramen.
He was found completely naked in his toilet by the master.
Dagestan's athlete couldn't explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
I.D. was helped by his missing persons.
Medical personnel who arrived at the call detected partial memory loss and cranial trauma in Hanmetov, reports the public of Mash.
There's probably other surprises waiting for the athlete.
The intruders who abducted Shamil probably already visited his apartment, which was also stolen from him.
The oil and gas revenues of July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, oil and gas revenues from July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, reported by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as explained by the agency, was due mainly to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to the ruble compared to the June average used for the valuation, as well as to the higher actual production of gas and the export volume of petroleum products projected.
“Deviation of the federal oil and gas revenues from the monthly assessment in accordance with the Federal Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected to be +40.2 billion roubles in August 2017”, a report by the Ministry of Finance.
Thus, the total amount spent on the purchase of foreign exchange in the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, daily foreign exchange purchases would amount to the equivalent of 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign exchange purchases by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Every working day during this period, the CB will enter into foreign exchange purchases on an organized tender by the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The killing of a journalist highlights the growing danger in Mexico.
The weekly newspaper Riodos usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover recent violent crimes in Sinaloa involving organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what appeared to be safer: taking children with them to an office where a grenade had already been thrown in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a board in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked the journalists to give us names for each column - no evidence is needed, suspicions and internal feelings will suffice.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a list of scoundrels that make the work of lighting chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence is not a respite, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, no fewer than 25 have been killed since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 have been under federal protection following attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, co-founder Javier Valdés Cardenas of Riodos.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdes wrote in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence everywhere is a large photograph of Valdés showing the middle finger with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the front of the Riodos building; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smile, face in glasses or his signature panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office had been set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases had been investigated.
As with most of the thousands of drug-related and organized crime-related homicides committed each year, journalists ' killers are rarely brought to justice.
Riodos journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although it is now much more dangerous around them.
Without information about murderers, without justice about meeting security, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdés left Riodos' office in the capital of Kuliacane.
He was only able to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot at 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "The Twelfth River".
The shooter drove his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to spread quickly on Couliacán.
But most people don't talk about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions struggle to fill the resulting vacuum.
Let us not say that one or more people are killed on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the cemetery is filled with two-storey mausoleums of drug lords, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that the state of calm is just when one of the cartels takes control of a maritime state with important ports and drug trafficking routes in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was crushed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso López, the leader of a rival cartel faction fighting Guzman's sons.
The publication was likely to anger the sons; people who were allegedly members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were taken to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdés to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story had been captured.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was considered another milestone in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He'd been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be there.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste, and in 2003, along with five colleagues, founded Riodos, selling his $50 stock.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without touching on the subject of drugs," Bohorkes said.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publishing, sales, and advertising income.
Journalists loved that they could publish bold stories without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted that they could read about what no one else had dared write about in this publication.
Eight years after its founding, Riodos won the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdés won the International Press Freedom Award for the courage to investigate the drug trade in Mexico, wherever it leads.
He confessed frankly that he was scared.
"I want to move on," he said at the CPJ Award.
The drug trade in Sinaloa, "it's a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompiento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist, either that or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodos' employees miss Valdez, the joker who used to swear like a port mover, a friend, a generous hug and advice, a teacher who knew how to stay alive.
They relied on the order they had been given.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, "Is his love of a once-in-a-lifetime order destroyed?"
His death led them to question their calculations as to how best to do their job and how best to survive.
"They don't like you knowing about their wives, kids, their legal business, and illegal drug-trafficking airfields.
"These things were beyond the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of Riodos Andres Villareal, is that "sniffing can be defrauded... and then what happened to Javier happens."
Old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa, as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak State institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodos officers gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to put in cell phones: days before that, it had become known that spy programmes, which were sold exclusively to Governments, were being used in Mexico to spy on journalists and social activists.
Outside, two policemen hide in the shades of a tree from a 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were instructed by the state government to guard the Riodos office, which is located in a four-storey building in the Culiacana bourgeois district.
Some journalists were joking about whether these policemen were part of the 50 per cent of the officers who the Governor himself said could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
The next issue of Riodos had three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio César Chávez.
They also had the disclosure of government spending concentrated in the Governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of Kuliakan's most expensive restaurants, a block away from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official announcement of who had been abducted or how it happened, so caution had to be exercised when it came time to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant for drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from public databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had dominated all levels of government over the past century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been publicly accused of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when Guzman's son El Chapo escaped the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have searched for Valdés' column with the most reliable information on the kidnapping.
"Before we knew what had happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his skinny build called El Flaco.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are severed."
Valdés' office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, because employees have become what they never thought they would be: activists acting on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office about another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacán, west of the country, three days after Valdés was killed.
Found a burned body, and the authorities claimed it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on sidewalks and on the walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., seeking international support for the demand for justice in the Valdés case.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdés Ramirez, she accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then asked not to be assigned more tasks to cover the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdés has said many times that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, its accomplices in government and indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narcotic Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not just being killed by drug gangs; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services in collusion with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 Press Protection Committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by the police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez says.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masías six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body found a note supposedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her head cut off.
Some publications chose to close, as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after her correspondent Miroslava Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on like El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo after her leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly contacted drug cartels through an editorial on the first page, entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or the country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work and they continue to see danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it is obvious that it happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work strike a daily balance between risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits he's scared to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, Riodos publishers sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan reportedly left 19 bodies behind.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted news on the Riodes website via their mobile phone.
The next day, I had to redo the first page.
The sirens were out in the vicinity - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes has seen if the guards are ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger had been placed on display throughout Sinaloa, the staff of Riodos continued his case.
"How can you think about closing yourself," said Bohorkes, "if on the very day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her outside to do a report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, albeit terrifying.
Researchers said that the first remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhinoceros discovered by a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts called it "Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the colour of his scales’ skin was reddish brown – and to say that he had, in some way, a “dark past.”
In a report published in Modern Biology magazine, it was described as "the best preserved from Tyreophor in the history of finding and one of the best dinosaurs in the world.
It's a fossil -- a recently discovered copy of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the mill between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good state stunned researchers, who call him “very wonderful.”
This herbivorous thireophor is the best preserved fossil of this species in the history of discovery, according to articles in National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fanck when he was working at the Millennium Mine of the Sankor Company near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed to be different from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, an animal was found inside the earth's surface with a mass of 2,500 ft. (1,100 kg).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the end result can be demonstrated.
“It’s worth a little squint, and you can almost believe he’s sleeping,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved copies of dinosaurs, Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.
After studying his skin, researchers found that it was herbivorous, even though it was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, it appeared to have been exposed to considerable danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful dinosaur shell used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used protective techniques known as protective colours, which are also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to blend more quickly into the environment and avoid encountering his enemies, says experts, suggesting that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, aged 110 million, belonging to the Nodosaurus family, was widely covered in the press in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum technician Mark Mitchell, a member of the band who spent more than 7,000 hours during his painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of scales and shell plates on his body.
They discovered a protective colour, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although protective coloring is common, the discovery came as a surprise, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than the size of the currently protected animals.
One can assume that this dinosaur has been so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution has chosen to mask confrontation as a way of survival.
But most of today’s protected animals – for example, deer, zebra, or armadillo – are much smaller and more accessible prey, indicating that the nodosaurus had to struggle seriously for survival.
“A serious threat from predators to a massive, massive dinosaur shell shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Mel Age were,” Brown said.
A chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur scales also indicates that its skin should have been reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, seeking information about his life, including the contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he sank and lay his back down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread far deeper into the land than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with the remaining scaly skin, while at the same time remaining completely in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did then, in the early melody period.
You don't have to use your imagination to recreate it, you just have to squint a little, and you can almost believe he's sleeping."
A mediocre period is an era in which giant teropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, a Tyreophor could be hunted by one of his formidable ancestors.
They include an acrocantosaurus, a beast of 38 feet (11.5 metres) in length, weighing six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in Modern Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after his death and mumigated in silt.
The creature was discovered by Sean Fanck when he was working at the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum's staff, this is the best-preserved tireograph in the world, along with skin and shell, and it's intact, from the face to the femoral bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five metres) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
They were characterized by two 20-inch spikes coming out of their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous tireograph was hard to do with what Canada is now until the spilled river took it to the high seas.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its shell to the smallest detail.
The fossils of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover the lumpy shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of security "is rare as winning the lottery".
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossils of the skin still cover the lumpy shell plates that sow the skull of the animal.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers turned up on it.
I can count scales on his soles."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to enter Poland without papers
Mikhail Saakashvili, who had previously led Georgia and then Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without proof of his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported in the Polish edition of Telewitza Republika, which posted a video of his performance on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at the commemoration of the Warsaw uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to speak in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of Georgia's cooperation with Poland and also referred to Ukraine.
That the Ukrainian immigration service had deprived him of his citizenship, the opportunist learned from his time in the United States.
How exactly he managed to fly the transatlantic without papers is not yet known.
The former Governor of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, had previously stated that his signature on the form to obtain Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not filled out any forms.
Investigating Weinzicher and Olhovik extended until January
The preliminary investigation into the case of Evgeny Olhovik, co-owner of the Renova Group, and Boris Weinzicher, head of the T Plus Energy Holding Company, extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court is considering the extension of house arrest by the accused.
The representative of the UK at the meeting reported on the decision to extend the pre-trial investigation for the last time.
“The special complexity and duration of the investigation are due to the need to seize and carry out an examination of a large number of documents, as well as to carry out investigative activities in the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation”, the investigator said.
He added that suspects regularly bribed Komi ' s leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzicher, Olhovik, as well as Mikhail Sloboddin, former head of the “Integrated Energy Systems”, who until 5 September had been the head of Vympelcom, paid bribes to senior officials of the Republic of Komi for setting the most advantageous tariffs on heat and electricity, as well as for creating a favourable business environment.
Weinzicher and Olhovik were detained, transferred to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Sloboddin escaped the investigation and was placed on federal wanted notice.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was deeply shocked.
Only one day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a St. Louis woman sat on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, looking at a Facebook tape on her phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Noting that no one else on her tape posted this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Her tape contained many user interchanges with @TheePharoh.
A real-time rapper from the Great St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's lifeless body, spread out in the street, where it would last four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrel thought.
But death wasn't something new to her and her circle.
She put the phone down, and then later tonight, she went back to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of a signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a poster saying, "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, pulled a gun and yelled, "I will kill you all... animals!"
“This is an unusual situation,” Ferrel said in her own recollections.
“This is not a murder like the one we're used to and can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and I cried."
She took a flight back and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson over the next nearly three years was the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", which will be released on August 11.
These are stories of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience from the perspective of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was on her way to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of colour, they remembered a conversation that had been held countless times before this morning, “the experience of black people and their condition.”
She remembers saying, "Do you remember when I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because a policeman killed an 18-year-old boy, and it was wrong."
"I couldn't help but take her," Ferrel said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be raised on it.
It must not only have a good understanding of activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their positions, and what we must do to be free to be free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd do her a bad favor if I could keep her out of it."
When they arrived at Ferguson, they made the first stop on South Floissant Road, on a site across the street from a police station that became some sort of tent camp while activists were waiting for reports of the final indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrel and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was making lunch packs.
They collected bags and helped the protesters distribute them.
A little in Ferrel's mind, a new form of activism has emerged.
“My activism has changed completely since 9 August,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Hygienic Students from National Minorities and worked on food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I did not have the experience of an organizer.
It came on its own.”
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said that she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrel came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play?"
This scepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and endurance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are not at the centre of attention, and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already merged with her co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His involvement aroused sympathy for the project at Ferrel and six other local residents with whom the team of the "Whose Streets?" project had been in touch for years since Brown's murder.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“This was the most important thing to me, as these people will be represented, because this is how I will be represented.”
Although the project’s goal was not to focus on Ferrel’s experience – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the lifeguard leader, but about how the community unites”, as Folayan said, it turned out to be the most open of the film’s participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrel's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” said Ferrel, laughing about the first time I saw a finished product.
“But I realized that when you do such work and humanize blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, the history of Ferrel again discusses and highlights the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the “Live of Blacks matters” movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - those who created #BlackLivesMater tags on social media after the murder of Trevon Martin's black teenager in 2012 - identify themselves as homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in leadership positions support all of this movement,” Ferrel says. “All because we're constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan accepted this assertion, noting that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and many homosexual black women”.
However, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrel was not selected as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
“She was the one who awakened this energy,” she said.
“On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she ended up in the first place because when ”
You can sense her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, there have been no cameras in Ferguson for a long time, but there remain complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on probation for two and a half years for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called home, simply: "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she went to Ferguson Street full three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Two Salvadoran football players were disqualified for biting U.S. players.
El Salvador football players Henry Romero and Darwin Serena received long-term disqualifications for non-sporting behaviour.
During the quarter final match of the Golden Cup of the Confederations of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
Henry Romero's protector was the first to be distinguished.
The Salvadoran bit Josie Altidore, the attacker, and then pinched him by the chest.
Serena then bit the U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez when he pitched the corner in his fine square.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Serena for six.
The meeting itself ended with a 2-0 American victory, transmitting Goal.com.
It's a resemblance: an artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA.
In the middle of the hall at the Freedman Gallery in New York City, faces of people, white, black and brown, all of which are elusively similar to each other, hang from the ceiling on the wire.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey Harborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent clippings from Fort Levenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving 35 years for a famous broadcast of confidential diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called The Exposition of Similarity.
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art unites technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissident, to whom Barack Obama reduced his sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analysing the DNA obtained from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of individuals who might have such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a profound, albeit difficult, manifesto about not only the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of interpreting them and the ingenious determinism of these interpretations - but also the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born under the name Bradley Edward, but when she was a teenager, openly said she thought she was a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the espionage act, computer fraud, and theft.
Her photos in prison were not available, so only one of her photographs was known: a grained black and white selfie, in which Manning, in platinum shade, was wearing a wig, apparently uncomfortable, sitting behind the wheel of a car, and was associated with that photograph.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed his 2012 "Vision of Strangers".
In it, the artist painted portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a preliminary screening of a new press exhibit.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison muse became pen pals and exchanged several letters over a period of two years.
They even wrote a book of "Depressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who depicted how in the future the president would ease Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
Obama’s decision to release Manning just a few days after the book’s release was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and strong that the exhibition is opening right now, when Donald Trump declares war on people who reveal secret information in the government and invents new ways to stir up animosity on Twitter that he's supposed to mitigate.
When Dewey Harborg was asked about the timing of this, she said, "There's no such thing as an accident."
In the artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning's huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of the "i" in her name) calls for an end to “automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the other side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar made out of pencils C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist is scientifically elegantly expressed), Dewey Harborg hoped to show how amazingly similar we are, at least in our biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome does not define what we are, how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective it is,” Dewey Harborg said; her 2007 video work, False Memories, is also displayed here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition, which was in one room, is the above-mentioned novel in comic books.
It features a King Kong-style Manning over the United States Correctional House with a loudspeaker in its hand.
"If they kill your speech, they'll win," it says.
"So never shut up."
"This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me," says the artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person - as it's been seen in the comic books - but when she comes, she'll be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, her own genomic simulations, gathered like crowds of protesters.
It's also done intentionally, like everyone at an exhibition up to height (5", height Manning), where a pencil drew genetic haplogroups.
"I would have hung them on walls earlier, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," Dewey Harborg says about portraits.
"I wanted them to look like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like a movement that stood behind her release."
Professor of Northwestern University and Oxford University staff member wanted by the police on charges of murder
According to the police, there is a nationwide raid on a professor at Northwestern University and a staff member at Oxford University who are wanted as suspects because a man was stabbed to death in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the Cook County Court records, warrants were issued on Monday for detention for premeditated murder without the right to be released on bail of 40-year-old Windham Latham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranlo, age 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27th.
The police received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the crime scene, and now detectives are investigating the death from knife wounds as her murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, Vice-President of the University of Communications, stated in an e-mail application that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to visit Northwestern University campuses.
“This is now a criminal case being investigated by authorized persons, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabbaj said.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College stated in an e-mail statement: “We have been in contact with the British police and are prepared to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative authorities.”
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
Chicago Police Chief of Communications Anthony Gulelmi said that he strongly advises suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” Gulielmi said.
According to Gulielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gulilmi, the police were called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene a terrible crime scene.
Gulelmi reported that it was unclear whether the incident itself occurred on 27 July.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirmed that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were connected,” Gulielmi said.
The Grand Plaza manuals issued a message to the visitors, stating: “The police are currently working on the timeline of the incident, gathering information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident”.
Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future."
Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that the terms of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) set for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be fulfilled shortly.
“A certain stage of compliance has been completed, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (the British Anti-Doping Agency).
WADA's road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map for restoring compliance with the Code, which listed the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA and had recently been published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian Andidoping structures should publicly accept the results of an investigation commissioned by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, alleging that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
On this point, Mutko said, “We are investigating because our anti-doping system has malfunctioned.
All measures have been taken.
But there was no government program, and we're not going to admit what didn't happen."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
The same morning, in an interview with Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged earlier problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report without reservation," added Smirnov.
WADA suspended RUSADA from conducting doping controls in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, it was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization's Moscow office in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivier Niggley, stated that RUSADA was “going in the right direction” to restore its work.
There's a fire in the 79-story tower in Dubai.
A major fire that occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, extinguished, transmits Reuters.
It is noted that the firemen were able to cope with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 msk).
The local authorities reported that no one had been injured in the incident.
The streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed while the fire was extinguished.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
Previously, it was reported that the 79-story skyscraper The Torch, one of the tallest buildings in the world, was on fire in Dubai.
All the tenants were evacuated in time.
Buzova's unimaginable outfit shocked fans: pants that don't cover their underwear.
Olga Busova's Scandal reality show "Doom 2" struck the audience of the Europa Plus Live Festival with dancing in their underwear.
In front of thousands of fans, a new singer with a duet from Nastya Kudri performed the song "We're going to be hot."
Both girls appeared on the stage in provocative brutes sewn in such a way that the undergarments of the singers appeared to be visible.
Buzova and Kudry were written on the trousers.
It was previously reported that a specialist from a Moscow plastic surgery clinic commented on the changes in the appearance of Busova.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
This was reported by Radio 4 on Friday, 4 August, with reference to foreign media.
According to him, it was the Russian authorities who were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Generalsack also criticized Russia for the Crimea situation and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
Stoltenberg assured, however, that dialogue with Russia was possible and that further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump stated that US-Russian relations were dangerously low, and accused the American Congress of doing so.
The Yekaterinburg Metro is learning a new way of paying.
In October, Paul Vedernikov, the CEO of the E-Net, stated in an interview with the Regional Gazette, will be able to pay for a trip to the Ekaterinburg metro.
Our goal is to introduce the same system of subway fare as other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk for the 2018 World Cup.
“We want fans from other countries, people from the mundial, to use the subway with their bank cards without buying badges or standing in line,” he said.
Startups that will help your company not to become another Uber
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among his startup e-commerce staff, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, insincere.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He has never been consistent and objective,” Herrett told the manager of a 75-person company in San Francisco, Madison Reed, which deals in hair-care e-commerce.
She therefore sought the assistance of others.
A new type of staff start-up is now emerging that helps companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to conduct rapid interviews, address certain teams and demographic groups, offer staff anonymity and hotlines for complaints and, in some cases, allow informants to pass through top management and direct contact with management.
“Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glint launch shop in Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Herrett said that she had gained a better understanding of what her staff thought and felt in three years of use of Glint.
In addition to the express interviews and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers the company's thermal map and shows in visual form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows them to understand why.
Companies are a little aware that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they will become another Uber involved in a scandal when a former employee posted a blog post describing an aggressive environment in which those who were disgruntled were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
The Internet portal, “Let's talk about payment”, dedicated to financial technology, estimates that the global governance, regulation and conformity industry could cost over $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Convercent launch from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the face of the fall in Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber became a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send individually commissioned staff opinions, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous text hotline that allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is involved, the complaints go straight to the board.
“The Court of Public Opinion seized power from the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If a company finds itself ill-treated or unethical, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of client boycotts, staff outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with over 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, used Convercent for over a year to make sure that employees were aware of the rules and procedures and to suggest a simple way to contact the company's head office.
In the past, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for a telephone number or an e-mail from the head office, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, reported James Vitrano, the head of the legal department of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that used to be hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment, and unfair pay – can be quickly detected and dealt with.
“I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation,” said Vitrano, who leads the risk management team of the Ruby Tuesday network.
“And we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings against employees.”
According to Queensland, companies began to take staff ethics, values and involvement more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen’s accounting firm collapsed due to ethical irregularities as a result of Dela Enron.
But it was only when social media became widespread that companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from viral distribution online.
“Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, charging companies regularly for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that has been endorsed by venture capitalists who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as the Sapphire Ventures and the Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessmer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In markets with strong competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just the minimum.
Staff members want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to companies with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work for the company, they feel they are heard, and the work they do results, they try more to make the company successful,” says Nina McQueen, Vice President for Global Benefits and Staff Satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies do well when employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the commitment and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to cultural experts in the workplace, it is important to have data on the involvement of employees.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks staff for feedback, it may give the impression that change is coming.
And if change does not happen quickly enough, or at all, frustration may develop, and the staff will lose interest.
“If you're going to ask for 4,000 offers, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” says Russell Rat, president of Kotter International’s management consulting firm, who had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will wonder, ‘Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Herrett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly staff interviews, is in a position to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem through Glint.
And after collecting feedback from staff dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge of its employees and hopes that in the long run this knowledge will help it to better retain staff in an industry known for high turnover.
“If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt is being opened on the Krasnoarmei prospectus.
In Barnaul, drastic measures were taken to address the cause of the asphalt failures on the Krasnoarmei prospectus.
It is decided to open the place where the holes appeared twice on the newly paved carriageway (youth street crossing).
Let us recall that a small section of the road near the tramway was collapsing because the land had sprung up in the area of the abandoned unserviceable network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Vice-Chairman of the City Committee on Roads, Improvement, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for detailed survey and elimination of the predispositions for collapse.
Depending on the results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is anticipated that the no-host communications area will need to be rehabilitated and concreteized.
This is reported on the official website of the provincial capital.
Bruins' team has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association canceled practice twice a day.
Time is approaching 11:00 p.m.; a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the team's new campus training fields.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts, exposed their backs, glittering from sweat after a busy first day of sports camp.
For many players in the team, these idle minutes are a break in the middle of the day.
After a three-hour training session, the players scheduled for summer classes will return to the dormitories to prepare for final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned to Tuesday, team coach Jim Maura said, "The next three days these guys are waiting for a meat cut."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on the players, actually extended their working hours – at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m., so that they could fit in with an already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two trainings a day was more days with one training, and Bruins moved the camp almost a week from last year and conducted training during summer school for the first time in six seasons of Maura in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they are scheduled to conduct 18 training sessions up to and including August 20 before starting official preparations for the first season against the Texas University A&M team in September.
Maura said he supported a change of policy by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that it had added another item to the player's schedule.
"For three or four days, we've put them on this huge burden, it's a serious test," Maura said.
"And they just overcame it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think that when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it'll be really great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will close the training; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed by footballs that have crossed the security grid behind the gates.
Bruins players should occupy a hotel starting this weekend, but Maura admits that when rooms are available during the season, there may be a problem.
"We'll have security," Maura said.
"It's a serious problem, and I don't exaggerate the danger by suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and record the training in a video.
If you have a video of training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and security in parking lot 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All victims of the St. Petersburg subway attack in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported to the press service of Lieutenant Governor Anna Mityanina.
At the end of July, there were three people left in the hospital, handing over the TV Center.
Let us recall that the St. Petersburg subway explosion occurred on 3 April this year.
The bomb was detonated by a suicide bomber, Akbarjon Jalilov.
The terrorist attack killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In a criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer, Abror Azimov, were arrested.
As will be recalled, on the previous day Rospetnadzor had recommended that the Metropolitan Bureau of Petersburg review the transport security plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook reinforces fact-checking in the fight against fake news.
Facebook will be more likely to send texts suspicious of mystifications to independent experts and show their findings under original posts, and announced on Thursday the world's largest social network that tries to fight so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, send them for testing, and possibly show the results of fact-checking under the base post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue is also under active debate in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports prior to the presidential elections in May, and in Germany, prior to the September elections, support was expressed for the plan to fine social media if they did not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, Facebook, in a separate statement in German, reported testing a new fact-checking algorithm that had been launched in the US, France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what reports are challenged by independent verifiers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgements about what they read and what they share,” Sarah Sue, a Facebook news manager, wrote in her cell block.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the linked articles function and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a comic novel: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scottney's tiny castle was filmed in a music video called "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a home for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy spot in the Bühl Valley in Kent County, he watched a violent story around him, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with smoked hair and a propensity for historical documents, for a novel comic book.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel it in person when you hold this letter in your hand."
"The Castle in England" covers the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells about families who lived in Scotland; each story was illustrated by a young British artist, Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote Dead Man's Tooths and Other Stories, a compilation of British Library documents; this project suddenly touched him deeply.
"I could have been touched by a thumbprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for Jacobites," he says.
"It's his thumbprint."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times, the lights were lit.
And in 300 years, in the future, you think you're there, too.
Oh, I love archives!"
For a man who is so passionate about old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months ("I'm a little bit caught up in it") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the "new" Victorian castle all day long, walked through the archives, and looked at numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things, such as the heads of hyenas on walls or bottles that had been in the pit for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners, and sometimes artists working on illustrations of his book.
Then at night, he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of the castle is not very well understood, because the National Foundation did not gain full access to it until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassie, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, staff were just beginning to deal with the archive he described as "that the aristocrats have been thrown into the attic for centuries."
Books, British Empire letters, maps showing who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring," Rhodes says, "but this bereza was fought by two families.
It happens like that, guys!"
In some of the compilation's stories, the castle becomes the starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in "Worker", the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasant Revolution.
“There is evidence of a riot that took place at the castle in 1380, in a book called the Knights' Families of Kent and Sussex,” Rhodes says.
"The Bristian rebellion started in these places, and I thought the riot was a good start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are strongly related to the history of the castle, such as the Priest, which tells of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family has been hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Smuggler," about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have faked his own funeral by stone-throwing a coffin (which was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family who inhabited Skotney: "Gentlemen seem to have been a perfect con artist, always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I imagine them as a company of handsome men who can care for the heirs of great fortunes."
After finishing his job at Castle Rhodes is looking for other ways to get a unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamyanmäki, a place where in the early 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew back into forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: Hell, I have to go back to real life again."
The top 15 banks choose Rossia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FK Open, seven other credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, no less than 80 per cent of the market will be accounted for by organizations that have withdrawn from the ARB.
But this is not just a solution - all banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that brings together credit institutions, the Association of Regional Banks “Russia”, which is headed by a well-known politician, Anatoly Aksakow, the Chairman of the Financial Market Committee of the State Duma, recognized, by the last session, and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and the deputy in terms of the number of bills drafted.
The conflict within the ARB began during the discussion in the Federation Council, when new bills were considered by the Interregional Banking Council, including a new classification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, stated that the association believed that the bill was being passed for the benefit of the largest banks, which were thus trying to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justify withdrawing licences from some banks, but was objected to by a representative of the Central Bank: many of the directors of the banks that were involved, such as Vnesprombank, were members of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a highly sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment has become a visible reason for the 15 largest banks to start preparing for membership of the Association “Russia” in opposition to the ARB policy, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB will be low and that constructive dialogue within the banking community is virtually non-existent”.
The depositors will be better off.
How's this gonna end?
Answer immediately the main question that arises in or around the slightest banking breakdown or conflict: depositors are not at risk, but rather the credibility of the banking system will be improved.
Anatoly Aksakov, known for his sensitivity to the interests of banks and their clients, is a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: virtually all the CBs are present at the annual activities of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert evaluations of the “regions”.
In terms of personnel and organization, it is also clear that there are no major disruptions.
There is no doubt that the ARB is in a difficult financial and managerial situation once such powerful and influential actors, with their contributions and lobbying capabilities, are dispossessed.
However, this oldest, established in 1991, has considerable potential to further improve banking legislation and monetary management in general.
Nor can it be said that Russia, with open arms, is prepared to accept new members on any terms, based on the reaction of its leader, Anatoli Aksakova (“may be too eager”), who, as early as 21 July at a briefing at the Parliamentary Newspaper press centre, stated that “the next day, the representatives of the ARB banks asked me to consider developing the potential of our association, Roscia”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
A negotiating process is under way, proposals from both sides are being studied, and an extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, to be held in Sochi in mid-September in the framework of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakow, stressing that “the chair does not hold,” described the possible new leader of the newly revamped association “Russia” Giorgi Luntovsky, who is leaving the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, with a high profile of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crimea, plans to suspend his leave for one day and to arrive in Moscow at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association of Russia, where the agenda for the extraordinary convention of Russia is scheduled to be considered.
The entry of petrol engines into major cities in Russia will not be restricted
The deputy head of the Ministry of Transport, Nikolai Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-powered cars into Russia’s major cities would not be restricted for the time being.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is to gradually raise the ecological class.
And that's where the concept goes straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, since what year?
It's like that at the slogan level. Let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Shall we close the whole town?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe that's what's going to happen," says the minister's Prime.
Earlier, the newspaper Izvetia reported that by 17 August, Vice-Premier Arkady Dvorkovic had been assigned to examine the proposals on possible options for the management of electric transport submitted to the Government by PAO CEO Kamaz Sergei Koggin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, are the use of vehicles with an ICE in major cities and resorts.
Washington's changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump has announced that a new US immigration plan will be adopted to change the rules for obtaining a Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be debated in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing how the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law would reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide advantages to candidates who own English, have the money to support themselves and have the skills to benefit our economy”, Trump said, according to the American media.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and that should bother us.
Before we knew that 2017 could not get any worse, a new report on technological advances in sex robot production came out.
Yeah.
Sex robots are in the spotlight right now.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of robot eyes, the shape of nipples, and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending a lot of it to consumers, and soon we'll see a lot more of it," said Sharkey at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflatable fellow robots to robots with silicone skin, warm to touch, and with almost human lines controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots in their own way, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a personality that would make Stepford's wife seem very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix Robot allows users to customize in robots the qualities that they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which are delivered with an already programmed identity - for example, Cold Farrah seems shy, and Wild Wendy has a "bold" character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that fits well with yours," says True Companion enthusiastically.
So she loves what you love, doesn't like what you don't love, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day, like a real man!
She can want to sleep or talk, or she can be in the mood!"
In the emergence of sex robots, much is troubling - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most disturbing is the subordinate image of a woman, an association with rape, which causes the Cold (read resisting) Farah to take over.
On "True Companion", Roxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality to the desire to have sex with submission as an option supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are neither bad nor aggressive until the free market gives them an opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complicated sex robots were born when women's rights around the world were threatened, when the White House has a president who boasts of hitting on women.
The worst thing about the TV series "Speaks of the Handmaid" is not graphic images, twisted bodies, and outcast eyes, namely, how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem that big.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical semblance of real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like human beings to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's the robots that don't look like real women.
They cannot break up with their partners or leave them.
They don't have their own life, they don't have a biography-- nothing that could point to independence or anything that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
A native of L.A. Eugene (Puch) Jeter, who has played for Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will begin on August 31, 2013.
This was reported in an interview to the BeBasket portal by the General Manager of the Blue and Yellow Andrei Lebedev.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately, he's not coming for family reasons.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
I remind you that, with Jeter's direct participation, the Ukrainian team ranked record sixth in Eurobasket 2013 and first entered the World Basketball Championship, where the yellow-blue were unable to overcome the group stage, while the U.S. national averaged 15.4 points per game, 3 rebounds and 5 assists per game.
Jeter has ceased to campaign for Ukraine since he resigned as the head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left his position in 2015.
A male Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Finland, Turkey, Romania and Israel.
The Ukrainian team will hold their matches in a group tournament on the Promised Earth.
Eugenia Murzine's wards will have five fights in Group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two battles, which gave way to Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
Being Mita Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, a common feature was the fact that political disputes that polarized the American electorate at the micro level shattered some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, U.S. newspapers used columns about how to deal with terrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all tense enough to burst.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-wing poet from Chicago, who had been on knives with Republicans in her family for a long time, came to New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
At Trump's White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she's been arguing about politics with for decades, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This is certainly good at dinner; but I cannot help but think that, in a broader context, it may be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed strength into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we'll be stopped by his pranks.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, who, against his standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness today - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 per cent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - compared to Trump's both seem like a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just be in his head to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went to the carousel with the kids in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are formidable and huge, glass fibre pictures on the central drum are makeup clowns and animals who look horribly at their backs, extremely ominous, and the sounding music, strangely, is exhilarating.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: skyscrapers are getting old, building silhouettes are too much to cause a trembling, and the reality of the city cannot keep up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day that I found out that the Suisse cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the Thematic pub "Ye Old Swiss Cottage" doesn't count) but a big roundabout in Northern London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where two-year-olds, 11-year-olds and two women in 40 can have a great time.
If I could give the carousels a grade, I'd give an A, but luckily, no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to run a terminal card, evaluate my "experience" purchases on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same plus the option of putting a 15 percent tea rating on the counter.
As a result, not only does the neutral interaction slow down, but it also has to be personalized in a situation that does not imply it.
The poor girl at the department store smiled confusedly while I was tired of evaluating my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius is leaving prison for the second time because of a doctor's visit.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which the prison administration claims he received as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office against an initial conviction for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine ' s Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the door of the toilet room in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he took his friend for a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office had announced its intention to lodge another protest, this time against Pretoria ' s six-year term, which she said was too soft.
The Attorney General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be heard this year.
Pretorius' term could be extended by 15 years if the prosecution succeeds.
South Africa does not have the death penalty.
The suspect in the beating of a NTV journalist has been selected as a non-exit subscription
Metropolitan law enforcement officials selected a security measure in the form of a non-departure subscription for a man who attacked a journalist on NTV channel Nikita Rassidzhev during a live broadcast from Gorski Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irina Volk.
“In the context of the investigation of a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code (Battery) against a 32-year-old man who struck a person by a television correspondent from a television station in the Central Park of Culture and Leisure, the suspect has been placed under a preventive measure in the form of a non-departure and proper conduct”, the wolf clarified.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol had been drawn up for the suspect ' s disobedience to the police.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during a live broadcast, a drunk man approached the reporter on WVD Day and punched him in the face.
As it turned out later, the bully had nothing to do with the VD.
According to Rassizhev himself, the paratroopers, on the other hand, tried to apprehend a Moscowman.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to BBCV, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal parking.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people who had provided tents in an undetermined location, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed BBC that Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of the free camping and already impose heavy fines on anyone caught while parking in an unauthorized location.
The checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court can impose a fine.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the U.S. Vice President of the cold war rhetoric.
Statements made during the US Vice President Michael Pens' European tour were criticized by the Russian MID.
“Unfortunately, Washington is drifting further and further towards primitive ideologically motivated cold war stamps, which are completely detached from reality,” states the Russian foreign service statement.
Thus, MIDE reacted to Pens' words about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly cover the borders he had told in Podgorica.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed to the destructive choice of “or with the West, or with Russia” and the vague notion of the alleged non-alternative entry of the whole of South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to exclude Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“Call upon United States colleagues to stop the shaming of Russia and its foreign policy, which is always based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively and on mutual consideration of interests”, states the statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The paramedic was injured in an ambulance accident in Moscow.
The accident occurred in the Moscow Stupino, and a paramedic was injured in a collision between a foreign cart and an ambulance.
Today, around 08:10 msk, a Mitsubishi car clashed with an ambulance in the town of Stupino in the Moscow region.
“As a result of the collision, the ambulance turned upside down”, said TASS to the Ministry of Internal Affairs Press Service for the Moscow Region.
There were law enforcement officers on the scene, and the circumstances of the incident were being clarified.
In Odessa, a woman threw her newborn son into a cellophane bag at the construction site.
On the evening of 3 August, the Division of Police received a report from a local resident that he had found a bag of a baby in an unbuilt private house.
“Law enforcement officers and doctors arrived at the scene and brought the child promptly to a medical facility”, reported the Odessa Head of the National Police.
The medical team found that the boy was born a few hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the umbilical cord.
In the course of priority operational and investigative activities, a 36-year-old local woman has been identified.
It has also been established that a woman has three other young children.
As noted in the chapter, the law enforcement family had not previously been identified or specifically registered.
The police officers are currently identifying the circumstances and reasons that have prompted the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the care of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolayev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into a garbage can.
Grigory Leps: "I'm going to fight, though 55's not 30."
One of the most successful artists of the Russian vestrada, Grigory Leps, will celebrate his 55th anniversary next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke to a columnist called News.
I remember when your 50 was celebrated.
A special tent at the Luzhniks, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
I'm sure you'd have thought you'd like to spend your next five-year-old.
Have the designs come true?
Speaking of profession, it was a good time.
I've been working hard, touring the country three times, giving 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, now I'm not what I was, say, 20 years ago.
Biological clocks can't be fooled.
Singing as I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
Still, I'm going to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
You're recording a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it right now.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we're sending it to Los Angeles for a meeting.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" by a song of the same name written with Timati.
She's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we get a video on her.
And let's introduce the album in November to a series of my anniversary concerts at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow.
Chris Coleman, a great American drummer, put his hand on your new record.
Do you think you wanted him on your tour too?
I think Coleman is one of the world's most outstanding drummers today.
He came to my studio to record his parties.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Coulson (a famous drummer involved in various projects.
But for long-term employment in Russia, they imposed excessive conditions, to say the least.
This involved fees ranging from 35,000 to 45,000 per month.
That's when I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer, Max Baby.
It's better to feed your own.
Sometimes I want to pick on one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted at the international level.
He's being written about by Western music magazines, invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wie, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came with another performing technique."
Your album comes down in L.A., American musicians cooperate with you, but you still can't come to the U.S.?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
I'm not doing anything right now, to be honest.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't go to America.
I've told you that I study there many times.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
For 70 years, our popular music performers have not been faced with the challenges that American musicians have always faced.
They were trying to get the best sound they could.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has refused me entry for ten years.
But I'll still apply for a visa every year to the British Embassy to be allowed to go back there and, most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a book, but a poster, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, and I've been there once.
Now we've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert have already been sold out.
Will you go to the Lima Wykul Randeva, which will start on July 20 in Jurmal?
She invited me, and I certainly responded.
Lyma is a great singer and a great woman who can present herself with beautiful vocals and even whispers.
After the tour and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you've been wanting to address Vladimir Vysocki's creativity on a number of occasions.
You've already got two albums with his songs in the disco.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be completely different.
I want to record about 80-90 Wysocki songs in about the same pitch as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician Timur Vedernnikov will accompany me.
I'll try to get Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it goes.
You and Boris Grebenschikov's songs gradually entered your repertoire.
Why don't you write his stuff down later?
Boris Borisovich is a great man and a great musician.
I've crossed paths with him a few times and asked him if I could sing one or the other of his songs.
He said, "Grigory, I write songs to be fulfilled."
Please try, sing.
I think it's interesting to make an album like this.
I don't have that kind of task yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't object, I might do a project like this.
Unless you focus entirely on your production center business.
I guess until you realized his potential, you didn't sign any of the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I'd dream of having under my wing, but they're independent, established people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Serezha's a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and has a development strategy.
And now there's Alexander Panayotov in my center, who I led in The Voice.
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be a shame if he didn't reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire. I'm filming videos.
I hope it's a good result.
I'm also trying to promote other artists in my center: buy them songs, pay the poets, sometimes their tracks are in the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they don't reach great heights, I'm still going to bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On their way out, they'll get a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want to, they can go their own way, and I won't insist that they get their money back.
Although it would be a pleasure if one of them made commercial progress and paid me the interest we agreed to in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not gonna shut down anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, get through, prove what I once proved.
If you're offered a tour of Ukraine tomorrow and you're guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited.
These are mainly closed events.
And as for the big tour...
I was a man of my country, a Russian, I was convinced to fly to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If they say tomorrow we have to go somewhere else in the interest of the state, I'll fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have had this situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we're the same people and we have to be together.
I'm sorry that's not likely to happen, at least not for a while.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We've met like nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorak, Light Loboda, Artem Loic...
There are a lot of gifted people in Ukraine, and it's a shame they can't fully spill their talent to a wide Russian audience right now.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I'd love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slava Vakarchuk, and make a concert with him.
But at this point, I think it's unlikely...
Andrei Ochlamkov was moved from the cosmodrome
As IA has become known, the technical director of the East Andrei Oslamkov launch site has begun work at the Khrunishev State Space Production Centre (HCNC).
He had previously de facto been involved in the construction of the East Cosmodrome, but because of disagreement with the management of the Centre for Land and Space Infrastructure Operations (CENCI), he had been transferred to a facility in the Moscow Philly to coordinate production.
Mr. Ochatkov will not have a replacement: the position of technical director is likely to be abolished and the function will be spread to the units of the CENCI.
That the Technical Director of the Eastern and Deputy Director-General for Technological Development of the CENCI, Andrei Oslamkov, had moved to work at the Hrunishev GKNPC, IA told top managers of several space industries, as well as a government official.
"He's been working in a new post for weeks," said the industry's "I" interlocutors.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from the CEI on Thursday, and Mr. Oslamkov himself was not available for comment.
However, IA's information was officially confirmed by HCOP.
He decided to take over the position of Director of Production Coordination, and said at the plant. Andrei Oslamkov had fully implemented his mission to ensure a minimum launch for the first launch at the Orient launch site.
Mr. Oslamkov joined the CENCI in 2013, having served in space forces, particularly in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk, having served as the first deputy commander in the "north" cosmodrome as a colonel.
In 2009, he became a criminal subject.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, since his application, regional traders had been paid for renegotiations of State orders, but had failed to comply with their obligations to clean separate parts of the carrier rockets in the Arhangel region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its technological development responsibilities were extended to various projects in the CENCI, but the construction of the Far East launch site was the main one.
The head of the Federal Space Agency then, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview with IA, clearly stated that the state of affairs in East "was critical as early as October 2013.
The fact is that the planning was a strategic error: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were scheduled to take place at the same time, at the end of 2015.
In order to complete the launch before the end of the year, it was decided to complete the construction six months earlier and the deadline was changed from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, it had to be a trick: CENCI specialists had started to install technology equipment in undeveloped facilities in parallel.
Andrei Oslamkov was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks involved and the transfer that took place (instead of December 2015, the Union took off only on April 28, 2016), this idea was justified, says the IO source at the launch site: "We would not have launched a single launch from the East until now, but we would have been building."
Vice-Premier Dmitry Rogozin, in charge of the creation of the cosmodrome, made a joke of calling Andrei Oslamkov his "space Susanin", but he was the one who almost always asked for information about the construction progress.
Mr. Oslamkov remembered and was straightforward: for example, in an interview with IE, he suggested that the Federal Special Construction Agency (Spetstro) be stripped of its status as the only performer in the East and work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all our eggs in one basket of Special Forces?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, SENCI has assumed the responsibility of the general contractor to complete the construction and installation work at the launch and technical complex by the fourth quarter.
According to IE, Mr. Oslamkov's transition to a new place of work was prompted by disagreements with CEI management on how to complete the construction of the structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as on how to work with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be best for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
A government official, in turn, calls the solution strange: “He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find an equivalent replacement”.
According to IA, this will not be required: the position of technical director of the launch site will be abolished and its functions will be located in the units of the CENCI.
There will be a two-course programme in music schools
In the future, pupils in children ' s music schools will be able to take two courses at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, St. Slav Golubenko, it is possible to read out recurrent subjects to students for this purpose, and the question of paying for the rest of the second occupation is resolved by means of special grants, transmitted to RIA Novosti.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken the matter under control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow two fields of study, but will not, at the same time, be in conflict with the legislation in force in the field of education”, Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Non-Child Talk" with the children of the Sirius Children's Centre, student Maria Andreeva reported that she was forced to pay for repeat subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was in violin and piano class and was awarded both competitions.
The Head of State recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russians are detained on the wall of a skyscraper.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who climbed the wall to the roof of a high-rise building, is reported by El Universal.
The incident occurred in Mexico City.
A young man, using two unknown men, climbed a three-metre fence into the Nestle compound and climbed one of its towers on his own.
In doing so, he did not use any special equipment, insurance or ropes.
They've already caught a young man on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security let him down by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute for Migration.
They find out if the young man is lawfully present in the country.
Meanwhile, the video of a young man climbing up the hill became popular online.
Users called a young man a Spider-Man.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help to ease the HCC.
Red meat and chocolate are commonly considered nightmares for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests otherwise: diets rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory intestinal diseases.
It is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leading to colics and abdominal swelling, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
In general, to mitigate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of triptophan protein contributes to the production of immune cells that enhance intestinal tolerance.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines ensured that malignant germs from food did not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of launching an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the equilibrium is too severe to inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory intestinal diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacteria in their intestines develop more tolerant cells.
And this bacteria needs a triptophane -- one of the building blocks of a protein -- to trigger these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We've established a connection between one type of bacteria -- Lactobacillus reuteri -- which is part of a normal microbioma of the intestine, and the development of a population of cells that enhance tolerance.
The more tryptophane was fed to the mice, the more immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work for people: a combination of L. reuteri and a rich triptophane diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammable environment in the intestines.
Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganovas, after studying a variety of tolerant immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line but was held separately had none.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by microbiomas in the intestines of mice - communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of mouse intestinal cells has been sequenced, and six types of bacteria present in mice with immune cells but missing in mice without them have been detected.
Mouses grown in sterile environments that did not have a good microbial and that did not develop this type of immune cell received L. reuteri, and they had immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then carried small portions of liquid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells separated from mice.
The immune cells have become more tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the processing of triptophane, known as indol-3-minoric acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophane in mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophane was halved, the number of cells also fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragán explains that humans have the same tolerance cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of the L. reuteri triptophane contribute to cell development in humans in the same way as mice, but individuals with inflammatory intestinal diseases have been found to have defects in the genes associated with the triptophane.
She says, "Maybe we need to strengthen the development of these cells, because these cells are the key to inflammatory processes on the inside of the intestines.
High levels of triptophane with L. reuteri have the potential to increase their population.”
According to José Maurinho, Manchester United hired “genius” as Nemania Matic
Manchester United hired "genius" in Nemania Matic, according to José Maurinho, after the quarterback made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player, purchased for £40 million from Chelsea, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last U.N. pre-season match before the UEFA Super Bowl against Real Madrid on Thursday, and impressed him as a mid-fielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke ahead when they wanted to.
However, since Matić did not participate in the Chelsea Asian pre-season tour, he was seriously short of preparation for the game and lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Maurinho, requires further work before the opening season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius is the way he thinks – he thinks of football,” said Maurinho.
“We will help him prepare sooner than later.”
Like Matich, his fellow new players Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukak began playing at Aviva Stadium when Maurinho began forming his main team by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Maurinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
“I thank the club for getting three out of four,” he added.
"I'll be even happier if they get me four out of four, but they've already done a lot for me."
The former leaders of the Lithuanian Social Democrats are urging them to remain in the ruling coalition.
Former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, ex-Premiers Algirdas Butkjavičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Speaker of the Seimas of the Social Democrats Cheslovas Jurschenas, appealed to one-party citizens to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the Parliamentary Gazette, due to tensions with partners - the Union of Peasants and Greens - a debate has been initiated in the Social Democratic Party on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
The three senior experienced comrades addressed an open letter to the one-party community, stating, inter alia, “I understand the party's frustration with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the peasants has created for us, although not very easy, the conditions for further implementation of the social justice goals that we have initiated in the Government's programme and for maintaining the political dominance of the left over the right-wing parties”.
In the view of former party leaders, so far “emotional expression of opinion has prevailed without specific arguments”.
The authors of the letter fear that their party ' s reckless actions could lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
Anton Mamayev, a disabled man, was fined.
Moshorsud reduced the sentence of the wheelchair disabled Anton Mamayev from four and a half years' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
The convicted person had previously been released from the remand centre by a decision of the Timiryazevsk court.
However, Mosgaard confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he organized the robbery and abduction of a scooter from a former SWAT fighter.
By his decision, Moshorsud reduced Anton Mamayev ' s sentence to 200,000 roubles.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and therefore such a person must be held criminally liable”, explained “IU” press secretary Moshorsud Ulian Solopov.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamav, the factual circumstances of the case and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which a sentence may be imposed below the lowest limit.
With regard to Mamav's assistant, Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would justify a change in the category of gravity of the act and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself stated that he was dissatisfied with Moshorsud's decision.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, and I intend to continue fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not exclude appeals to the cassation instance of Mosgaardud and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the leverage up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "Ria News."
Remember, 28-year-old Moscowman Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became the subject of a criminal case last fall.
The disabled man claims to have bought a scooter from a friend for 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, scooter owners, among them a former SWAT fighter, claimed that the disabled and his assistant, Vasily Seroshtanov, had taken their property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in the colony and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years ' imprisonment, serving his sentence in general-regime colonies (article 162, para. 2, of the Criminal Code).
After the disabled person was placed in the remand centre, the Public Chamber, the Office of the Attorney-General, under President Tatiana Moskalkov ' s Human Rights Commissioner, was involved.
As a result, Anton Mamayev was released from SIZO in mid-July by a decision of the same Timyrazev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of first instance in Moshorsud.
CSF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The final “Action Forum” of the Pan-Russian People's Front (PFF) in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, inform Izvesdam of the source at the FAN and confirm the head of the executive committee of the Alexei Anissimov movement.
He said that, following the forum, the “frontists” were planning to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the domestic environment, as well as to propose a strategy to address them.
Izvestei's interviewees at the SWF note that the report to the Head of State will contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to The News, the final SWF forum will be held in the autumn.
The exact date has not yet been determined - it is usually tailored to the President ' s schedule, who is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key CPF events.
The Front has held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts in Rostov-on-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirova.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital city of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulaanbaatar.
Based on the suggestions that have been made and will be made at these events, we will form systemic proposals to address environmental problems, and we have told the Izvestoms to the UNF.
The Co-Chairman of the Central Staff of the Olga Timofeev Movement, who chaired the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, reported that the “frontists” would report to the Head of State on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the SWF Action Forum are likely to be combined.
In a year, we left behind a powerful team of environmental experts, saw gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the “frontists” also report on the work on the priority projects of the SWF,” she told Olg Timothy's Izvestom.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would be invited to the forum.
He had previously participated in the SWF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months' time, the Year of Ecology will be in history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they can work for years.
To keep these issues on the agenda, Olga Timothy added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), Andrei Kolyadin, noted that in raising environmental issues, the SWF is acting on the presidential agenda.
Many things they, as experts, have offered in various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the President, Andrei Kolyadin said to the Ideas.
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded, which could provide additional impetus for development in the regions.
In the future, the regions would be able to lobby not only for their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, with the help of the SWF, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the Balashyeh landfill (already closed) and the coal dust at the port of Nakhodka (a bill to ban open trans-shipment of coal in settlements, one of the authors Olga Timothy, has already been drafted).
Environmental experts believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been established, and the issue is further enforcement as well as the position of civil society.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is needed, according to Leonid Bochin, the head of the charitable foundation “Ecology for All”.
HRC member, the head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergei Tsyplenkov, in a conversation with Izvesia, stressed that a responsible approach by society and business was essential for the successful resolution of environmental problems, with little legislative effort.
As soon as society and business realizes that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in strategic terms, the situation will change, as noted by Sergei Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that there was a need to reverse the trend that infringement of environmental legislation was an economic solution for business.
The British inventor implanted a microchip to get into the house and the car by the swing of his hand.
The British inventor was the first person in the country to be installed with a microchip so that he could open the door of his house, enter the office, and even start a car with a simple hand swing.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northham has implanted a tiny chip between his thumbs and his index finger, and now offers this service through his BioTek firm to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anaesthetist consultant from the Royal Winchester, to ensure that the injection procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that implants cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also replaces locks in homes and cars with a chip-compatible price of £300 per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed technology in his home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the handlebars.
The White House prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to the Armed Forces records given to the magazine "TIME", the decision of the White House last month to bring a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One", when the president was on board, became a central feature of the White House event on July 17, which featured American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pens, and senior White House officials examined the technology products from all 50 states.
A helicopter produced in Connecticut was shown next to a boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a Mississippi truck.
According to the records of the First Squadron of Marine Helicopters (HMX-1), the helicopter control department of the White House Military Department ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an “unusual” event.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you knew because this is an unusual media event,” wrote HMX-1 commander in an e-mail to his superior, the First Deputy Chief of Marine Corps Aviation, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at around 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return to the flight in accordance with the working hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, while security guards remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records received by TIME whether a second crew was required as a result.
The Hetch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event was in conflict with this regulation.
“We asked, among other things, whether it was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told it wasn't,” the commander wrote.
“You seem to have nowhere to go,” the deputy chief replied.
The event “made in America” was declared the White House as an official event and was not subject to Hatch's law.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the health-care reform then in the Senate and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to ask for them only in the interests of photo ops.
Trump was already the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
“The White House is thrilled by the show “made in America”, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” says Deputy White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights around the Washington Agglomeration and the South Lawn to train the President of the United States to the White House to the nearest inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight for the "Done in America" event was counted to the crew for the necessary training flights in a month.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of the “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not covered by any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not been involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not record the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rate for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense's rate of reimbursement for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit recorded a 30-minute flight time in the air from each side of its airfield at the Quantico Marine Airbase in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“It is completely wrong to calculate the value for taxpayers based on the approximate rate of reimbursement,” Walters says.
“These approximate rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs, which are included in annual allotments.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by RAND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke out in defense of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate this week the things done in America,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose job depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
It is, of course, entirely appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump had interacted with the helicopter by inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he definitely sat in the driver's seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump contacted Shikorsky, making a press joke about his own food fleet.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said. “I have three of them.”
Moscow will provide grants for the resuscitation units of urban hospitals
Every year, lifesaving grants will be allocated to intensive care centres and intensive care units in the Metropolitan Medical Clinic.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, visited the Yudin City Clinic.
During his examination of the clinic, he delivered a thank-you letter to the trauma doctor ortoped Victor Protsko, who led the most difficult operation to reconstruct the foot of the adolescent.
Sergei Sobyanin also spoke of the decision to grant annual grants to the intensive care centres and units of the city ' s clinics.
Funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the city’s capital chief, Yudin’s clinical hospital is today one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new and modern equipment to enable its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the Colombo Rural Hospital.
At present, the wards of a health institution are intended to accommodate more than 1,000 patients.
In addition to resuscitation and inpatient services, there are day-care units.
The hospital has 2,800 staff.
The total area occupied by the medical profession is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the health facility became part of a pilot project on short-term inpatients (STI).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical intervention, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce the time taken to rehabilitate patients.
After the hospital surgery, they only spend a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were treated in hospital at Yudin Clinic.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported no buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
In the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), there were no applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
This is reported to TASS on Friday, 4 August, with reference to a representative of the NBU press service.
The NBA confirms that on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from Victor Prokopeni, a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, was withdrawn in order to negotiate the purchase of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares indirectly (through Paritetbank).
“No documents were received from other potential investors to purchase Sberbank shares in the NBA”, the communication notes.
On 3 August, a Belarusian businessman, Victor Prokopenja, withdrew an application for the purchase of Sberbank's daughter structure.
On 28 July, it was reported that the National Bank of Ukraine had denied Russian businessmen Said Guzeriav and Grigory Guselnikov the acquisition of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator based his decision on the failure of businessmen to provide the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank reported the sale of his Ukrainian “daughter” to Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guzeriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guzeriev.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
During the year, they are not allowed to take capital out of the country in favour of parent organizations.
The third season trailer "Narcko": The Kali cartel plays a central role in the popular series "Netflix" after Pablo Escobar's death.
Although the identity of Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of "Narcko", the series "Netflix" is far from complete.
The flow service has already confirmed that seasons three and four are planned, and the third has already been introduced by the first trailer to demonstrate the villains of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the drug agency attracted the attention of the richest drug dealer organization, the Cali cartel.
An organization led by powerful godfathers works as a Fortune 500 corporation, with only a large number of government bribes and acts of violence.
The cartel leader, Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela (Damian Alcasar), Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela (Francis) is her brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is responsible for relations with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz-Londoño (Pepé Rapasote) works in New York.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character who draws American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to help in the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Mathias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Angel Sylvester, Kerry Bichet and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcko" will be released on September 1.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, declared to the UN.
The elections can only be representative when all members of society, including women, have been represented by the head of the UN mission to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Heisom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the post of Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overemphasized”, he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Choices can only be fully representative when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threaten to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year ' s elections, power is, for the first time, transferred peacefully from one democratically elected Government to another.
Haysom stated that enhancing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghanistan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The Office of the Prosecutor-General confirmed the indictment in the Nikita Belykh case
The Office of the Prosecutor-General of the Russian Federation confirmed the criminal indictment against the former governor of Kirovsk province, Nikita Belykh, who was accused of having received a large bribe.
This was reported to the agency on Thursday, 3 August, transmitting RIA News.
The case file was submitted to the Presnasky District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, penalties for tourists for inappropriate behaviour have been tightened.
Venetian authorities have increased the fines for bathing in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
Walking around the city in a bathing suit or naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros each will require a public picnic or bicycle ride across pedestrian areas to transmit TASS with a reference to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
It is also mentioned that the authorities impose a fine for inscriptions on Euro400 monuments and for garbage of Euro25.
Travelers will be informed of the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice through a special company called Enjoy, Respect Venice (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) on social media, as well as through announcements and posters on the City Council website, billboards and the most frequent tourist destinations.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the tourism adviser, Paula Mar, fines will be transmitted to the embassies of the home countries of the offenders in order to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she noted.
In April, the Italian administration announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
In Venice, the restrictions on the number of tourists visiting the city centre are already working well.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to observe the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 visitors were admitted to the scene.
In addition, there has been a moratorium on the establishment of new fast-food hotels and restaurants in the historical part of Venice.
In the first half of 2017, State Border Guard officers detained 272 illegal migrants at the border with EU countries; a total of 1,059 irregular migrants were detained.
It's been reported to the State Border Service.
Of these, 314 were detained for illegal border crossing, while the remainder were detained for violating the rules governing the residence of foreigners in Ukraine and other offences.

According to statistics, most of the detained illegal migrants are nationals of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, India and Armenia.
Moreover, almost 2,000 potential illegal migrants had not been allowed into Ukraine.
Remember, the EU has found an unusual way to get rid of migrants.

There are many stars among Skolkovo Jazz Science 2017, including the Moscow Jazz Orchestra Igor Butman, who will present a joint program with vocalist Jaroslav Simonova.
Jazz and science are related concepts, and not by accident they've merged, explained the folk artist Izvestoms.
The experiment and improvisation of jazzman are as highly valued as scientists.
One of the main events of the festival will be the performance of Azekel, a British Nigerian, known both for his own art and for working with legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.
The jazz fans of Russia’s first five-time Grammy Award nominee, Pianist Christian Sands of the U.S.A., are looking forward to performing with their trio.
In a new capacity, one of the best academic chamber orchestras, Music Viva, under the leadership of Alexander Rudin and with the participation of the piano player Yuri Favorin, will try.
The merger of jazz, ethnic and electronic music, as well as academic traditions, will demonstrate the Marimba Plus ensemble and its leader, composer and performer at the Marimba Lea Splepner.
One of the most unusual festival performances promises to be the Serguei Kurehin Anton Maskeliadze award-winning net.
The art experimenter controls music and video with gestures -- that's how leap motion works.
There will be eight music groups on two scenes of the festival.
In addition, the programme includes open debates, interactive zones and art objects combined with the idea of merging music and science.
Guests will be able to participate in experiments, visit the science buffet, and observe the creation of cryo-frozen or quick sands from starch and water.
In the special vinyl area, it will be possible to purchase records of current jazz performers and other musical groups, and in the book fair it will be possible to purchase publications on various subjects, including music, popular science and biomedical literature.
SF relieved Ozrov of his post as head of the committee
On Wednesday, the Federation Council endorsed the statement of Victor Ozerov, Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, and dismissed him from his post.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk.
He wrote a statement requesting his release from the position of Lake last week.
He attributed his decision to the need for rotation and his desire to change the pace of life.
The Senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.
Victor Lakesov has been representing the legislative assembly of Khabarovsk Krai in the Russian Federation since 1996.
The Committee on Defence and Security has been chaired by the Senator since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to set fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, the cost of low voltage electricity for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation, in accordance with Government Decision No. 842 of 17 July 2017 on amendments to the Regulations on the Wholesale Market for Electricity and Power and the Consolidated Projected Balance of Production and Supply of Electric Power (Capacity) within the Russian Single Energy System for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, established indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for the drilling industry is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly improve the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have been beating the threshold of Moscow’s cabinets in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkut region with the cascade of hydroelectric power plants on Angara, which flows from Baikal, whose main catchment area is Buryatia.
It was only this year that progress began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 roubles/kWh to 3.93 roubles/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by decision of the Federal Government in the list of wholesale price areas for which the characteristics of wholesale and retail markets are established, industrial consumers have taken a turn.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 roubles per kilowatt hour.
But no one dares to give at least an approximate date for the new tariff downward movement for Buryatia.
Scooter didn't get scared by the Ukrainian Attorney General's Office and flew to Crimea.
The legend of electronic dance music, a group of Scooter, flew to Crimea without fear of threats from the Office of the Procurator-General of Ukraine.
"The flight went well, and I'm going to have a concert tomorrow," RIA News quotes H.P. Baxter's frontman.
Earlier, a German edition of Bild, referring to the Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Yevgeny Jenin, reported that musicians could face up to eight years of imprisonment if they arrived in Crimea, which in Kiev is considered to be temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine.
Scooter's performance at the Balaclav Festival, called #ZBFest, is scheduled for August 4.
#ZBFest is hosted by Golden Balka in honour of International Champagne Day.
==History==Scoother, one of Germany's most famous bands, was founded in 1993.
Ace's last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scooter, the festival will be hosted by Sergei Galanin and his group SerGa, as well as by Garik Sukachev with Briga C.
The Moscow subway will be the premiere of the new "Game of Thrones" season.
The Russian premiere of the seventh season of "Game of Thrones" will take place in the metropolitan metro.
That's what the Comsomol Truth website says.
It is known that the first episode will be shown on the night of July 18 at one of the stations of the "Metro Night" campaign.
There's gonna be actors dressed as white walkers in the lobby under the soundtrack of the show.
All who wish to do so will also be able to take a picture with a copy of the iron throne that will be installed on the platform.
According to Roman Latypov, the first Deputy Director of the Moscow Metro, who will be the first in history, will help the audience to feel better about what's happening on the screen.
The national union of unskilled, municipal and boiler workers (GMB) is concerned about capital investment at the McVitie's factory in Glasgow.
The union requires guarantees from the managers of the McVitie's biscuit manufacturer in connection with his long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of the GMB reports that the company has ignored the question of future investment in the enterprise.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea baker, among other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years, it has invested more than £5 million in the facility.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the work of the facility, the employees and union representatives “are the first to know about them”.
In a letter to the head of the company's facility, the Scottish branch of the GMB demanded McVitie's response to concerns that funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
The senior organizer, Drew Duffy, said, “Our union members are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the general manager of the facility on business needs and investment plans regarding the future of Tolcross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in local society and in the territory of the Greater Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, rising subsistence levels, and chronic declines in production, East End Glasgow desperately needs to thrive at McVitie's factory.
According to a representative of Pladis, “The leader of the Interrosian facility just received a letter yesterday from the Scotland office of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, because we appreciate our continued cooperation with the employees and representatives of the union.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolkross with staff and representatives of the GMB, at which we openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to staff about how all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic environment are constantly reviewing their actions – and this applies to all our facilities and activities – in order to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our interpretation facility, especially in production lines and improved performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolkross as a production facility, and in the event of any change in the work at this facility, the employees and union representatives will be the first to know.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the Kremlin and the Cabinet should be involved in the supply of gas to the Eastern Petroleum Company (VNHC), but that no one would give Gasprom instructions, nor Rosnefti.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin’s request to help resolve the contradictions that had arisen.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be determined solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHC threatened the project's life.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue was ongoing.
Gazprom suggests finding gas resources from Rosnefti's perimeter, but we don't have such resources," Sechin added.
It should be recalled that Rosneft requested permission to use gas from the Ghazproma field of Kirin, located on the Saheline shelf, for the “Eastern petrochemical company”.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on this issue were ongoing and “there are no sharp corners”.
Did SGW warn Barcelona about the Nimar crossing three years ago?
A member of La Ligue may regret his interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris St. Germain won't stop chasing Neumar after the club offered £189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record attack three years ago?
The Sensational Proposal revived the summer transfer window when League Club 1 was ready to break the world record for the transition, more than double the previous mark for the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is over, Naymar will be the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's highest-paid professional athlete, as the SGW offers him over 500,000 pounds a week in net terms.
It is known that Barcelona is a fury from the proposal and how Naymar ended the contract, despite what a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club insists, the club has always done everything for the player since his transition from Santas in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the president of the SGC?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that wanted to lure one of the best players in the SGC.
“I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will oppose them, we will make suggestions to their players,” Al-Helaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences.”
It appears that Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club expressed interest in a mid-fielder from the SGC, Marco Verratti, earlier this summer.
The SGW has made it clear that it will not release an Italian player on any conditions, and it is now likely that Barcelona feels the consequences of its offer of losing one of its most valuable players, Naymar.
Putin has commissioned payments to the victims of the forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed us to understand the material assistance provided to forest-affected residents and to build new housing.
Today, I'd like to hear how the work is going.
In particular, please report on the status of the payments made to the injured citizens.
I have some confusion.
“In this regard, I would also like to ask relevant colleagues how much money has been allocated,” Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the regions on Baikal.
On 4 August, Vladimir Putin visited the Baykal State Nature Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the Plenipotentiaries of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Moylo, and the head of the Baykal branch of the FGBU “Glavbvod” Leonid Mikhaylik.
They told me about the work on cleaning up the lake.
The boys were then shown in an open tank next to the container that had been prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin released some of the boys from the net.
Then he pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and released the others.
Also during the visit, the leader commissioned an environmental assessment of Baikal and the construction of a road on the island of Olhon.
According to MINStroj, one volume is needed, but there is an alleged other volume.
"I want to figure out what's actually going on there with our funding," said the Russian leader.
It should be recalled that during the forest fires of 2017, the villages of Buryatia, Irkutsk province, were hit by fire, and homes and buildings were destroyed.
In Ukraine, it was suggested that Russians should be sent to prison for illegal border crossing
The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has registered a draft law under which Russians may be subject to criminal sanctions for illegally crossing the Ukrainian border.
According to RT, the document registered in the Ukrainian Parliament ' s electronic database is a three-year prison sentence for Russian citizens attempting to enter the country illegally.
It is noted that for a repeat offence or an act committed by a group of persons, the sentence may be increased to five years.
If the perpetrator was detained at the border with the weapon, the time of detention for him would be increased to eight years.
It was previously reported that Ukrainian border guards had detained Ukrainians who had tried to enter Russia outside the designated crossing points.
Magnit's out in the open.
Magnit's second food director announced the opening of three new Magnit-Opt test shops, which are designed to buy produce in bulk.
However, the possibility of purchasing goods for retail purposes remains, as stated in the company ' s press release.
The new stores were made available in Krasnodar, Saratov and Ulyanovsk.
There are about 1,500 items of food and non-food items.
"The new service will allow companies and entrepreneurs to buy for financial gain, and the residents to buy food for a week or a month," they're sure of Magnit.
Metro Cash & Carry and Selgros Cash & Carry are already active in the small-opt segment.
In 2017, Lenta launched a special Lenta Pro programme: it invited legal entities and private entrepreneurs to purchase at special hypermarkets, receive invoices to account for costs and refund VAT.
The project focuses on the HoReCa segment, small retail and offices.
There will be two new territories in Russia that are leading socio-economic development: Abaza and Novotroitsk.
The relevant decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation will enter into force today, 4 August.
The boundaries and economic activities of the TOR are defined in the territory of the city of Abaza in the Republic of Hakasia.
In a city of 15,000 people, there will be a special legal regime for business activity, as well as a minimum capital investment by residents and a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
This is expected to attract some 2.5 billion roubles of investment in the city, as well as to generate more than 600 new jobs.
The list of economic activities in which the special legal regime for business activities will be applied in the Abaza, for example, includes crop production, livestock production, food production, non-alcoholic beverages and clothing.
Already, the Government of the Republic has signed framework agreements for the implementation of eight investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the Territory's dependence on the Abakan mine, a city-making enterprise.
In January 2017, the authorities in the region reported that Hakasia had met all the conditions of the Ministry of Economic Development for the establishment of the TOR.
The authorities of the Orenburg region have also done the same.
There, the town of Novotrotsik will also have an area leading to socio-economic development.
This will diversify the mono-city economy, reduce its dependence on the urbanizing enterprise of Ural steel, and create more than 23,000 jobs and attract investment of more than 8 billion roubles.
The list of economic activities under which the new TOR will have a special legal regime for entrepreneurs includes, inter alia, freshwater fish farming, feed production, medicines and medical supplies.
Novotroitsk was the first monocity in the Orenburg region to be granted the status of TOR.
It should be recalled that a forward-looking territory is an economic zone with preferential tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges that are created to attract investment in improving the lives of the population.
The following benefits are available to residents of the TOS: a profit tax of not more than 5 per cent in the first five years, and at least 10 per cent in the next five years, a social contribution of 7.6 per cent in 10 years, the use of the customs free zone, preferential access to various infrastructure facilities, and preferential rent rates.

Yuri Loza expressed his outrage at the remarks made by American rock musician Marilyn Manson, who insulted Moscow.
In an interview with Komsomol Truth, the Russian singer called Manson "the bad guy" and "the bad guy."
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
Besides, Loza thinks Manson needs to face for what he says.
Remember, an American artist, known for his epic acts, spoke harshly about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that Manson's statement was commented on by national producer Joseph Prigojeen.
