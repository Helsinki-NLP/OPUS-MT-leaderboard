Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
The new Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is meeting with his Japanese colleague, Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo to discuss economic and security linkages as part of his first serious overseas visit since the May election.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world's third largest economy.
At the top of the agenda are plans to enhance nuclear cooperation.
India also reportedly looks forward to an agreement on defence cooperation between the two States.
FANO Russia will hold a final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO Russia) will co-host the third expert session “Evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, and is reported in a press release to the Lenta.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to take stock of the work of the Expert Session over the year and to establish a final list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
Individual participants in the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for assessing the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be the culmination of a series of events to create a common approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the normative documents is in the process of being agreed upon.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis and agree on the stages and timing of the assessment”, said the head of the expert and analytical department of the Federation of Russia, Elena Aksenov.
Representatives of more than 100 Russian scientific institutions will participate in the event.
It is expected that a resolution will be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at 14 Moscow City, Solyanka Street.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars.
Astrophysicists at the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied turbulence and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of experts will allow for the search of related stars, i.e., from a single cluster.
The results of their research have been published in Nature magazine and are available briefly on the university website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearby stars is the turbulence in the clouds of gas prior to the formation of the stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of birth and the region of formation of the next-of-kin stars.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
Modelling results from astrophysicists show that such differences should not emerge.
In their research, supercomputer experts simulated two interstellar gas streams that formed a cloud together.
For several million years, this object has been transformed by its own gravity into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added markings to the original gas streams and found that rapid turbulence caused a high degree of chemical homogeneity in the cloud.
Astrophysicists believe that their research proves that it is possible to search for chemically related stars, as well as to identify possible regions of the formation of such objects.
Karrata police arrested a 20-year-old after chasing a motorcycle at high speed.
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through a busheland to escape the police force in Pilbar.
A transport police patrol in Karrat tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning, discovering that it was at 125 km/h when he left the service station at Butgate Road.
The police reported that the motorcyclists had not stopped and continued on Burgess Road, then turned into a bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
A motorcycle and a person matching the description of the driver were observed near the house on Walcott Way in Bulgarre.
Karrata police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.

Lavrov: Russia will not slam the door in connection with the new sanctions and will not withdraw from the WTO
Russia will not slam the door in connection with the new sanctions.
This was announced today by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, who addressed the students and teachers of the MIMO.
As for our response to a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything has to be calculated, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will be like this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not involve slamming doors, some kind of misapprehension,” the Minister stressed.
We will, above all, build on our interests, our interests to protect our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners with regard to their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions can be very well judged by what partners are seeking, as the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation continued.
If people say, "They'll be painful for us, too, but we have to do it to punish Russia," that's probably not very adequate."
As far as WTO is concerned, the Russian Federation ' s response to possible new sanctions is not.
On the other hand, we want to learn more about the WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolbox to overcome what we believe is the EU's discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the Minister, Russia has been accused of dumping and has been subject to anti-dumping measures against the Russian Federation ' s economic sectors.
“We are ready to engage the WTO mechanisms and to defend our position against the application of the EU’s third power package rules retrospectively,” Lavrov said.
How is it right to use the siren in garden design?
Irina Okunewa answers the questions:
As the lilac loses its main appeal after its bloom, it is desirable to plant it with other bushes.
It's perfectly compatible with many cultures.
And it is possible and necessary to plant plants that are decorative at other times and that are blooming at the same time as the siren.
Another benefit of the siren is that it provides a lot of creative opportunities.
You can form it with a stamped tree of various heights, an improved bush, a bush with a broad base, and even like a garden bonsai tree with a bizarrely curved barrel.
Just choose the shape that is more appropriate to your garden design.
In Karelia, a resident of Leningrad Oblast was convicted of selling counterfeit money
According to reports from the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, a man was engaged in his criminal activities in the Olonetsk and Ségezh districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in the Vologda region, where he was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment in the spring of this year.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonetsky District Court.
And in order to complete the investigation into the crimes committed in our Republic, he was transferred to Ségeja.
In the course of the investigation, several episodes of counterfeit money sales dating back to the summer of 2013 have been proved guilty.
At the end of June this year, the criminal case file containing the indictment was sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to commute the term of deprivation of liberty for four years to a general-regime colony.
The sentence did not enter into force.
Remember, last week, two other counterfeit money dealers were convicted and paid at Petrozavodsk's stores.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is imprisoned for five years and the other for four years.
Each is fined 500,000 roubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
In Arkhangelsk, we celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first Dervish convoy.
The match, which took place at the regional centre, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military aid from the United States and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held near a pawnstone to the future monument of the northern convoys, located on the Sedov waterfront in Solombala.
The event brought together representatives of the Arkhangelsk veterans, children from the Cadet class.
For the first time, we met 23 years ago, when a mortgage stone was laid.
But at the same time, today’s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who have not been brought back by the sea.” Boris Karpov, chairman of the North Sea Shipping Council, noted.
The event was followed by a town spirit orchestra, and the cadets gave the veterans flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the banner of victory.
The match ended with the laying of flowers to the mortgage stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formal boots, tin, wool and a variety of other items and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and armament - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines and 15 Harrickane fighters - were also on board.
The escort was made up of 16 British Navy ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The ship's caravan was not detected by the enemy and reached its destination safely, Arkhangelska.
Of a total of 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport vessels and some 50 military vessels were killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that protects the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
"Where unions are, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, the Minnesota Democrat, who is co-chair of the Congress of Progressive Fraction.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Workers Empowerment Act with the Civil Rights Movement symbol John Lewis.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunities to discriminate against trade union organizations as other forms of discrimination by stopping the forces of trade union opponents.
The amendment of the Labour Regulation Act in such a way as to allow workers who face discrimination for their association with trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive damages and punitive payments - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis, and the co-authors of the bill are to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks on trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country - Americans once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding and respecting labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when that country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his associates helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Tojo’s paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler’s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that stated openly: “The right to form associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will have no legal effect; measures to that end will be declared illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights to be adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a world agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his interests”.
For generations, Americans have taken due note of the basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country consulted other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and to have the union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the union movement did not undermine the nation's strength, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it should be for us.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge is temporarily blocking a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the enactment of Louisiana's law on Sunday, which his supporters say is likely to close down all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under this measure, which was signed for execution by the Governor of Louisiana, Bobby Jinadl, in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to receive patients in a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision meant that doctors could now continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such authority.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to act on their credentials,” wrote Judge John de Gravelles in his decision.
A hearing will be scheduled within a month during which the judge will render a more permanent decision on the Act.
Advocates of the right to abortion welcomed this decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority.
“Today's decision guarantees that Louisiana's women will be protected from a insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights”, said Nancy Northap, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a motion to suspend the law on behalf of three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from the two clinics who had not filed a complaint in the case and also applied for admission.
Louisiana is in the 11 states that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Advocates of the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that admission laws impose medically unnecessary restrictions on doctors.
Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who aborts in Louisiana has the authority to receive at the hospital, as reported by the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all other doctors in the state were to be forced to stop doing this procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would have stopped doing the procedure, the team informed.
In criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for admission were awaiting a decision.
What will result from the introduction of quotas on domestic products
At least half of the products for each product should be Russian-made in the range of trading networks, according to State Duma deputy Oleg Nilov of the “Just Russia” faction.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers and writes the newspaper Izvestya.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This is the case for goods that are not produced in Russia, and for the rest of the products that are produced in Russia, the reteiler will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers,” the Niles informed the publication.
Together with amendments to the article “On the bases of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation”, the draft law provides for the amendment of the Tax Code, which sets a lower VAT rate of 10 per cent for the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea of a 50% quota in trade networks is part of the stimulus package for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the counters.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to the lawyer of Taxinik, a member of the independent expert centre “Public Duma”, Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
Farmers, farmers, small shops will be in a positive position.
They'll be able to sell more, which means profits will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to the retakers, as they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, resulting in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some faster to absorb, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will be reduced several times, but not immediately,” the expert notes.
In the past, Russian enterprises were often unable to break into local shops because of the high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been liberated and can breathe with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that, after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now is the "silence moment" when the former players have left and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, there was an increase in demand for domestic raw materials, as well as an increase in the prices of finished products,” Aif.ru told the first Vice-President of the Russian-wide public organization “Russian Club of Financial Directors”, Mr. Tamara Kasyanov.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category will make it possible to hold the sector to local producers.
In such a case, they would compete with each other, rather than with products that, through subsidies from another State, were cheaper.
In other words, the competition for the buyer will begin between companies operating under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes that Russian producers are not able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of their compatriots on all counts.
And in this situation, trading networks will have to “stretch” the share of Russian goods to half the range.
As a result, there is a growing fear that poor goods will enter the counters.
Perhaps foreign products with broken labels will be supplied under the guise of Russian production," the expert adds.
The negative impact of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that benefit from cooperation with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer as demand for their products decreases.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods may affect consumers as well.
The fact is that some Russian-made products may be inferior to imported analogues, while shops can raise prices for the second, like a scarce commodity.
The idea of import substitution, which was forgotten in the early 2000s, was repeated by economists in February this year because of the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of the abandonment of imported products is even more pressing.
The purpose of the Act is to require reteilers to treat suppliers as domestic producers when making orders.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the route of import substitution, and the production planning system for the required products will be established within a shorter time frame,” says deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism would be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where capacity was particularly high, for example in the dairy sector where imports accounted for 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really capable of fully covering the counters of Russian shops.
In addition, meat production can also gain strong momentum.
As is known, the largest proportion of imports remain for beef, ranging from 30 to 35 per cent.
So 65-70 percent is still Russian produce," Kasianova says.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas on domestic products would facilitate import substitution and could speed up the process.
However, this initiative alone will not lead to import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is certain.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under the initiative could still be imported from abroad, which meant that no full replacement would take place, but significant steps in that direction would be taken.
In addition, there are few quotas, and there is still a need for domestic production to meet these quotas.
These quotas will provide such guarantees”, the expert notes.
Untimely diagnosed and lack of access to optimal treatment means that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who forgive in rural Australia face a higher risk of mortality from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers analysed the disease maps of over 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35% had lived five years after being diagnosed.
Chief researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Research reported that the probability of dying during the study was 20 percent higher for those living in regions and remote areas of the state than for those living in urban areas.
A LITTLE RESEARCH: New drugs can slow down lung cancer and ovarian cancer
Researchers have followed the medical path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socio-economic status also affected survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside cities were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that delayed diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecology oncology, and they're mostly in big cities," she said.
Despite improvements in the quality of tele-health services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would enable professionals to treat women closer to home and in support programmes for people receiving treatment far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical location, the study found that life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer caser, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Coast, Elisha Nive, was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open the doors in the Cuzhenere district.
The construction of a health facility in the village of Toktaibeljak began in April this year and was based on a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information, Head Mary El, the construction of the facility was financed from the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the treatment and prevention facility built is almost 230 square metres.
The villages of Toktaibeljak and the villages of Dementjevo, Pünchryumal, Tuña, Fomichi, Toraibeljak, Shinur and Chashkayal will be provided with medical care.
A new midwifery clinic will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources and does not meet the health and hygiene requirements.
A new institution will be opened shortly.
The newbokssar woman who killed a four-month-old son in a drunken state will be brought to justice.
Chuvashia's resident will be on the dock for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksarah, the criminal investigation of a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarska, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation found that, on 26 July this year, the accused, together with his four-month-old son, had come to Cheboksara to celebrate the birth of his child.
After a long stay, the newcomer decided to stay and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, a drunk woman put him next to her on the bed to feed her breasts, but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
Criminal case, reported by the SCR Press Service on Chuvashia, referred to the court.
Inflation is out of vacation.
Whether Russians will feel price surges
As a result of the Russian and Western cross-sanctions, inflation in Russia will accelerate and fail to meet the expectations of the authorities, and the analysts of the VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed effects of the sanctions would lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writing by BCF Daily.
According to the latest development forecast, inflation will be 6.5-7.5 per cent in 2014 and 6.5 per cent in the following year.
However, according to the Kommersant newspaper, this week the MER is due to make “small but fundamental” adjustments to the macroeconomic outlook until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could reduce the inflation rate for 2015 to eliminate the expected income growth.
The projection was that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation were valid for the year until August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation suggests a one-off shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change.”
The UXO-Capital economists do not share the Government's financial and economic bloc's expectations of inflation and forecast a price increase of 8 per cent in 2014.
The main effect of food bans will come with the possible introduction of a sales tax (SAT) in 2015 in the regions of the Russian Federation, experts are convinced.
Inflationary peaks of 9% will occur in February, after which the annual rate of price increases will fall, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat had the first inflation scores since the Russian Federation imposed “cautionary sanctions”.
Aif.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the Analysis Department of the FC AForex:
Prices are already rising in major product segments.
Moreover, when socially important products began to be valued, the Government was forced to initiate systematic monitoring of price stability in order to avoid the risks of undue price increases in the short term.
Vendors and retelelers already report daily to regulators to ensure that the authorities know exactly who, when and why the price rises.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be enormous capital outflows, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversions due to population flight into foreign currency, and the embargo on the importation of food products from countries that have joined sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures had remained under control, the cost of a basket of minimum products would not have jumped by 12% in just one quarter.
The ban on the importation of food products caused a supply shock in the domestic market and led to a logical increase in the final cost.
Since at this stage we are not able to fully implement the mechanism of import substitution, as well as to improve the Russian market ' s self-sufficiency through domestic production, the sanctions will continue to carry the risks of rising inflation.
Adding the fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in the national currency as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director, Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached between 20 and 30 per cent per month, and in zero it was also above current levels, another thing that was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think the year's inflation is 8-8.5 percent.
Plato Maguta, asset manager of the Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully contained, but if pressure on the financial sector is further increased, first and foremost, it may lead to some difficulties and increase the population’s inflationary expectations, which are usually manifested in the purchase of cash currency to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the Russian Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both through market methods and government regulation.
But price increases have traditionally begun after the summer calm and may become more pronounced this fall.
Russia’s target consumer inflation rate of 7.5 per cent is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centres are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, due to an exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, may result in horticultural centres losing tens of millions of pounds per year when today's young consumers reach the “main age of horticulture”, according to the HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to the report, renters spend on average 55 per cent of the amount they spend on horticulture.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting courtyards in front of the house for parking, and the reduction of the size of the garden as other threats to an industry whose annual sales are estimated at £5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the UK has the lowest household expenditure on horticultural goods.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that renting and lack of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser at RHS, said, "Breeding in containers, for example, is particularly popular among tenants who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the golden age of retailing goods for horticulture as a result of the increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather following adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out mass cleansing at the Landelerie Foundation
Three of the four Earthly Foundation managers were replaced as early as Friday.
In total, three of the four Earthelyes were replaced as early as Friday.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria officially reported only the removal of the Executive Director, Atanas Dobrev.
Lausanne Vasilyeva took his place.
It turns out that two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were changed quietly on Friday.
Deputy Executive Director Tatiana Angelova, who until then was responsible for public assistance and the SAPARD programme, has been released, reports BGNES with reference to the newspaper Trud.
I didn't attend the board because we're not members of the board by law, but I was told later that I was released.
I can't tell you why my resignation isn't posted on the foundation's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I learn more on Monday," said Angelov.
She will be replaced by Ivanka Baggatova, who was still the head of Investment Credit at the central foundation at Landline in Sofia.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nikolai Dachev, was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
Zivko Zivkov, who was the head of the Landelerie Foundation's Regional Directorate in the city of Velva Tjernovo until January 2014, will be appointed to his place.
Only Atije Aliyev-Weli, Deputy Fund Manager, retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the agency are not mentioned.
Turkey summons an American diplomat in connection with a report of espionage
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent reported that the American Chargé d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the message on Monday.
The German magazine "Der Spiegel" and the Internet magazine "The Intercept" reported that the documents provided by Edward Snowden, a former U.S. National Security Agency analyst, showed that Turkey was a priority for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan understated the importance of the report by saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
Previous reports that the main German intelligence agency had also made Ankara a target of intelligence had elicited a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
The biggest Chinese companies have united against Alibaba.
Chinese companies, among which the largest commercial real estate developer in China, the Dalian Wanda Group, and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (socinets, Messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online market with Alibaba.
However, catching up on the Chinese Internet miracle that has left behind even its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the Largest
Companies are planning to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in a joint venture, 70% of which will be owned by Wanda and 15% each of the Internet companies, as reported by the Wanda Group.
It is planned to register the firm in Hong Kong.
SP will integrate Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, with some 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, Wanda manages at least 49 commercial properties throughout China and 40 trading centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a thematic entertainment park in Qindao (a city in eastern China on the coast of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors each year and generate revenue of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American AMC Entertainment Holdings, making the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its trading centres, hotels, and entertainment places with e-commerce services, which will be developed by a competitor named Alibaba.
According to Dong Ce, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of e-commerce users from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new platform should become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, noting Dong Ce.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract customers on the Internet to go to regular offline stores or to buy other traditional services.
Classic examples of O2O are coupons such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest pie in the online business," said Wanda leader Wang Jianlin.
"There is currently no real O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances are roughly equal," he says.
The Chinese Internet market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, with Bloomberg reporting official statistics: it is larger than the population of any country in the world except India.
It is projected that this number will rise to 850 million by 2015.
Union of the Richest
Tencent Ma Huaten was until recently China's richest man, but according to the Bloomberg millionaire index, the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, had already surpassed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share in Alibaba.
The leader of Baidu Robin Lee now ranks third among China's richest people, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda is the fourth highest ranking.
"It's very interesting to watch this battle: the three richest people join together to challenge the richer one," said Bloomberg, director of the China Center for E-Commerce Research in Hangzhou Cao Lai.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to compete seriously with Aliba as soon as it is created: "Rim cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not so – simply competing not only with new companies, but also with the well-deserved leaders of the world’s Internet trade – is illustrated by the previous year’s report on Alibaba’s financial performance over the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as a mean between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profits during the period were almost double that of competitors - almost tripled on an annual basis to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has great potential for generating money, largely because of its mobile applications," commented Bloomberg on the report of an analyst from Hong Kong's Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the US Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, well above the March figure (163 million).
However, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the last quarter were carried out by mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of its shares before IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after selling shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place on September 16.
The road-show company preceding this event will begin on September 3.
Alibaba's entry into IPO is expected to be the highest in the history of NYSE and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the record of the US stock was held by the Visa payment system, which in 2008 made the initial placement of its shares, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food in the trading networks should be Russian-made, according to the State Duma.
They've drafted a bill on the subject.
These include the amendment of article 8 of the Federal Code on the Fundamentals of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification under the bill is that at least 50 per cent of domestically produced products in shops must be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in the winter, so they will be given a discount to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which sets a lower VAT rate of 10 per cent for all food products of which Russia is the country of origin, and reports to the newspaper Izvetia.
On 27 August, a draft law was submitted to the Lower House of Parliament to amend the FZ “On retail markets”, which proposes to revive farmers' markets in Russia, where small producers can market their products.
Chief of Police Magaluf charged with corruption
The plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the State Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvia on the Resort Island of Mallorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Magalufe centre of unbridled drunkenness.
The Chief Inspector, José Antonio Navarro, was detained as a result of allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, the street where most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's daily online publication, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard on charges of corruption and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say that protectionism by the authorities seriously affects their businesses.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving," said a businessman to the court.
Our livelihoods cannot be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was placed in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British recreationalist who knocked 24 men off during a bar race.
Since then, the island’s authorities have tried to stop drinking disorderly behaviour among Magaluf’s resters, minimizing the number of scandalous drinking runs at bars.
In addition, Playhouse, where the blowjob incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the run were fined €55000 ($73,000) together.
Magaluf Tourist Resort, mainly popular among young British vacationers, was also the scene of numerous alcohol-intoxicated accidents associated with the crazy fun known as "balconing" when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in southern Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm rain fell on the city at 9 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm that fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short rains with a bursting wind, including a storm that started shortly before 8 p.m. and spilled almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter released an early spring last week, the temperature dropped again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
Squalid conditions are believed to have contributed to the delay in landing Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but entered the wind shift - sudden changes in wind speed or direction at a short distance - and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind bursts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to gain altitude during its second landing, and the aircraft finally landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay in this flight caused subsequent delays to several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday, with a probability of one or two rains.
The calculation of the construction projects in the Russian Federation will be carried out in a new manner
The Federal Antimonopoly Service is taking special care of issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, and connectivity problems.
The FÁS has set up an expert council to promote competition in the construction sector.
At its meeting, the head of the Directorate of Control of WAC, Construction and Natural Resources of FAS, Vadim Solovyev, stated that “the calculation of the construction estimates today is completely incomprehensible”.
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and may lead to an unreasonable construction price, as considered by the FAS.
And they offer the cost of building state-owned facilities at the design stage to determine, on the basis of market prices, design solutions instead of the currently estimated standards and unit costs for technological operations.
These proposals have been included in the road map and are currently under consideration in the Ministry of Mines.
“Replacement of the traditional estimated construction documentation for the calculation of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” explained Vadim Solovev's "BSG".
The estimates now include every bolt and nut, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes unfair construction companies can bury “whole tractors” in the documentation.
Minstroy and FAS agree.
“The first work on the conversion to value for design elements is already in place: methodologies have been developed for calculating design prices, estimating these indicators,” the Chief of the Urban Planning and Architecture Department of the Ministry of Construction, Elena Zhukov, explained to the BSG.
Road construction has been selected as a pilot area.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
Anatoly Demyanco, the head of the Profi-invest construction company, said that the estimated standards had long been outdated, but no other mechanism had yet been offered to the business.
“As for the proposed calculations for the design elements, this is difficult to implement in practice, as the technologies used in building construction are often quite different”, he believes.
It's no secret that the scavenger develops in many ways because of a government order.
In the opinion of Catherine Lezina, chairman of the NP board, the “Expert Community of Professionals of the State Order”, the State today is the most solvent customer.
Deputy Director of Engineering of the Rosatom Capital Development Centre, Vladimir Malakhov, noted that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts and companies that have monopoly competences and do not allow competitors to enter the field.
He believed that a transparent market could be established only if access to contracts was as secure as possible from someone's management influence.
At the expert council, it was suggested that the system of State orders should be established in such a way that the same performer could not receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion roubles or several contracts worth more than 1 billion roubles.
The Ministry believes that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of its impact on business as well as the effectiveness of building management.
As was explained by Elena Zhukov, it would then be necessary to provide the employer with a general contractor, which would result in an increase in the employer ' s staffing and maintenance budget.
In doing so, the specialists of the employer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality and safety of the work performed by the contracting organizations.
Often, such a breakdown would need to identify who would be responsible for the security of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly qualified public procurement participants due to a lack of interest in obtaining a government order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.
Alexander Evstaschenkov, the head of the Institute of Purchasing Expert Advisory Centre, believes that the State Order procedure has now become a business game for the care of the contractor.
And he gave the example: “A participant, when completing an application, must indicate “specific indicators” without the words: “or equivalent”, “should be”, “from”, “more”, “below”, “also”, “or”, “like”, “not below”, “below”, “higher”, “may”, “may have”, “may have”, “already”, “not before”, “not above”, “not allowed”, “not allowed”, etc.
Thus, employers often abuse their right to impose requirements on the content of an application submitted by contracting entities.
Another problem 44-FZ, according to Evstaschenkov, was the need to assess the quality of the work through the participant's “paper” proposal even at the application stage.
When considering the participant's application, only the contractor's qualifications can be evaluated, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been done, the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is accepted.
The expert board also proposed that the margin income be moved from the top to the bottom so that the intermediate contractors would disappear.
The chairman of the expert board, the State Secretary, the deputy head of the FAS, Andrei Tzarikovski, believes that this is not worth doing, since the order should be in charge of the general contractor.
Otherwise, as in Arkady Rykin's famous replica, "Atele": "Is there a problem with buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in shelters, when rockets and landmines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the territory was being rebuilt after the fighting.
The start of school classes brought joy and excitement to the rocket-affected settlements in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of Pashos kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed fragments from the walls and slides before the pupils arrived.
"We're a little afraid, but we're happy to look to the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibutza Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to get back to a decent life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that all of a sudden she's going back to school "a little weird."
"It's been a difficult time, and we haven't left our homes at all," she said.
President Reuwen Rivlin visited Kibbutz, close to the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, did not go outside or left their homes, leaving for safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, settlements near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a fragment of a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools during that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border, which had been hard hit by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study hard and said, "We will do our utmost to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade on Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
A new phase of proximity talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to substantiate this allegation.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza fighters fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli army launched more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed as a result of Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools, which have been transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope that the school will soon open so that we can complete our education, like the children of the world and Jewish children”, said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a school in Gaza.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the largest winter rise in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index in Australia's capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, and was reported by RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the 12-month increase by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless reported that Sydney and Melbourne run a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney housing prices have risen by 16.1 per cent over the past year, compared with 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The next largest markets were Adelaide, Brisbein, and Darwin, where prices increased from 5 to 6 per cent on average.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was marked by government spending cuts, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of real estate items placed on the market over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
“Bearing in mind the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will rise in the next three months,” he said.
How do people live in the oldest house of Ufa?
There are 18 apartments in the former house of the gold industry and the miners Yevdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on October Revolution 57/1 (formerly the Great Kazan).
The house of the 18th century has hardly changed since its construction, except for the dilapidation.
Outsiders come here as guided tours, and tenants suffer more than they rejoice at their privilege of living in the oldest Uphim house, the walls of which are remembered by Chief Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the building of the house is not accurate, historians point to two dates, 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out the building is 300 years old.
Old yard, always open door, squeaky stairs.
The doors in the apartments are close to each other, the walls are cracked, and the floors of the plaster can be seen on the street.
Everything seems to be holding on to an honest word.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's true."
Living in an 18th-century wooden house is very difficult, says Tatiana Lukianov, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on the government guard, but no money is allocated for it for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have simply forgotten.
The last one was 40 years ago.
The walls are still leaning thinly, but the foundations are rotten.
Many residents still go to the bathroom on the street and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be happy under such conditions?!
The road goes right under the windows, there's no pedestrian area.
Tatiana's moving the curtain.
Now you can see what you've heard before: there's a traffic stream under the windows.
You see, the windows are drowsy all the time, we can't open the windows, we're used to the noise.
People get used to good things and bad things.
Our apartment is still a model, thanks to his husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, the three of us with our son.
Other families are in a much worse situation, with ceilings just above five feet [1.5 m] high on the second floor.
To contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from Apartment No. 6.
A nice, hospitable woman from the door offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live with our husband and daughter with our granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another place to live, and Ludmila's eyes are rounding the room: antresoli, two sofas with the letter "g," one of them has a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But from the ceiling, it regularly flows: the plumbing system is useless.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment in a casual and surprising way at the same time, like an Italian woman whose house is in Roman ruins.
I mean, it makes one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The pipeline was conducted some 40 years ago during the last repairs.
That's when they made us a little cuisine and a toilet from the former closet.
We live just where Demidov and his family lived, and there were servants on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatised, and why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Center, they say privatization doesn't matter.
We'll only get a one-room apartment anyway, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised a settlement, but that was the end of the deal.
I'm not used to complaining, and I'm not gonna complain.
There's a dynasty in this apartment, my grandparents, my mom and dad, my husband and my daughter and my granddaughter.
It's been a while.
Like, big rats running around in the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flirt, they're about a meter thick!
They say the solution was mixed up in eggs, so it's been holding on for so long.
The house is well built, thank you Demidov!
That's probably the only reason anyone's been killed by a collapsing ceiling or a swai.
Only the building is slowly dying before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors fail repeatedly, we pour cement, but it's useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say it is - beneath our room is a secret loophole and a passage to the White River, which was deliberately made by the old men who once lived here so that they could escape the danger, in which case.
They've been followed.
Ludmila Starstina tells them how some historian came to see them, begged them to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then he convinced them to give them the apartment space in exchange for his one on October's prospectus.
Ludmila said no to the historian:
Where are the four of us together?
And there's a little hope here that'll give you a bigger place to live.
If we agreed to a trade, nothing would have won.
The Old Men's family won nothing, though.
Ludmila's biggest dream to be settled, and a daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
In other words, two families have been allocated a two-room apartment, instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations now live.
The cute, miniature girl Oles Karsakova from apartments 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, her large family lives in two small rooms, with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments.
There are seven of us, two children.
You see what the terms are.
The pane falls in pieces, like window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms, through holes.
The water in the tap is only cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of Ufa's oldest house, one can see that Lawrence's wife from apartment four is the most fortunate.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
It's 75 squares, it's three people.
We live in those rooms where the legend is that Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, says the head of the family Alexander Dmitryevich Lavrov.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing is, everyone's slamming around, falling apart, falling apart.
Neighbors must have told you!
The most torments we have on the floors are that the wooden boards have rotted, and the earth has literally gone from under our feet.
I've set up the pads, the clink; there's nothing in the hall, and in the other room, we're going like swings, it's so shaky.
The house of merchant Yevdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitriewicz can speak better than any guide.
The gold industry is treated like its own, says it with admiration.
Indeed, the identity was extraordinary: the owner of the Kaginsk and Uzian factories built houses, drained guns and bells, and held the Ural mines.
The heirs of the coup d'état are proud of their ancestor, but they don't want to live under the same roof as history anymore.
I settled here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden carriages, stables, and guard booths that were then demolished.
They wanted to clean up our house in 1968, but something got in the way...
The story was repeated in 2014: again, new housing was lured.
As a team, we collected all the documents, ran the right places, and suddenly we found out that moving to apartments was moving to 2015 or 2016.
I don't believe in any of this anymore.
Two years ago, he went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The officials didn't accept the tenant.
It was sent from table to table, and then, as a mockery, it was issued without a signature or a stamp: “The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of the occupants”.
I even feel like our house isn't in town for a long time, because it was number 57, and then it was 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like it was demolished in the '70s.
The Russian Planet approached the head of the information and analysis sector of the Ufa Land Administration, Vladimir Barabash.
A house on the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the resettlement programme for dilapidated housing.
I can't be held accountable for the actions of officials in the '70s, I just know there was a plan at the time to demolish all the old houses, despite their historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities to rebuild all old houses on October Revolution Street, which are of architectural value, is being successfully implemented.
Residents are expected to be settled in new apartments soon.
According to Barabash, the reconstruction of the Demidov House will be carried out by Italian specialists who were involved in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
There is now an architectural biennale in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there, among others.
I hope that by 2016, the entire former Old Kazan Street will be restored, says the official.
Houses will become a proper form, corresponding to what was before three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to be an open museum.
In addition, a decision has been taken at the government level to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
Unfortunately, it won't work on weekdays, it's too busy in the city.
The settlement of people from the future museum, Vladimir Barabash, promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same as the current one.
Only from another era.
The storm started a forest fire in Primorje.
The dry storm caused a forest fire in the hunting grounds in the Pozhar district of the Primorsk Krai.
There is a build-up of a group of assets at the site of the fire.
According to the management of the Maritime Air Base, the conditions at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of Air Base:
A fire, which occurred in difficult terrain, was detected by an observer pilot on board an Antonov-2 patrol in an area of 3 hectares.
There's wood residue on the old burner.
The heavy debris of the area and the steepness of the slope over 45 degrees, the lack of suitable landing areas, pose considerable difficulties in extinguishing.
We need an MI-8 helicopter.
The deployment of an Mi-2 helicopter and an AN-2 aircraft to the airbase is severely hampered.
Following the discovery of the fire, four fire parachutists were quickly planted at the scene of the fire.
The main task of the specialists is to put an end to the fire and to prepare a site for the delivery of additional fire-extinguishing equipment.
In the area of lunch, an additional 3 paratroopers were brought to the village of Hunting by helicopter.
As soon as the landing site in the area of the fire is ready, the specialists will be relocated to the extinguishing area, as reported on the website of the Administration of the Primorsk Krai.
My father never hugged me.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children born to Jamaican immigrants to Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rookie records, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of Radio 4.
The soundtrack's a rap and rap mix, and the melodies are fun.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult childhood memories.
Since his mother's death, there has been a lot of treatment, and Henry often ponders his relationship with his father.
It was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket punch.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was such a non-smirk guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a foundry shop in Dudley and, although conditions had improved than in his father’s day, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
It's a little bit better now, but it's dark, smokey, deep labyrinths of hell with flashes of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.
My father climbed into the bath and just lay there, and you heard him slowly singing to himself because he wanted to wash himself away from the foundry shop.
When I got there, I realized that he'd done it for years and years to earn us a living, and I'd appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry left his childhood without parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when my mom got sick at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don French.
Why shouldn't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, who he's been married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started a serious phytense class, and I also had to take a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry's change of career path is reflected perhaps in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he got a confession from the critics for his Othello, he's been in the theater completely.
And then August Wilson's Fences.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedy, which were an indispensable feature of his rich professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him parodying on stage, and wrote about him in New Faces.
His career on television began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black parody/comic on television."
He went to work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "The New Face" in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the Black and White Menstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "blacked their face," Henry discovered that he had been performing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of wish it never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked in large areas and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the award-winning light entertainment classic on British television years and years" was also "a grotesque parody on black people."
Representing the characters who were mocking and singing black culture in the UK, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of "Lenney Henry's Show" was broadcast in 1984, and in the '90s he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock of the comedy series "The Chef!".
Advertisements, documentaries, television series, and role in the film took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC show in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv", he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're stalling or slowly turning aside."
Then there was the Radio 4 documentary series, "What's Good About...?"
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I can't be said to be taught that in high school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with tights and cabbages down the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You need to try.
Don't scold it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for a documentary, and he got caught.
I had a feeling I could do it.
It's like my head's been fixed.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it on.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started "The Commedia of Mistakes."
Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical malfunction, and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to entertain the public.
"A quiet voice inside of me said, "You're gonna have to work 10 minutes while they're fixing the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You're in the play, stay in the play."
Henry's in the fences at the Duchess Theatre.
It was hard to learn the text for the fences.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens muscle.
It was also well received, so it was like a sign from above showing you, "That's what you should do."
He's saying it, of course, with a loud voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has a comedian's mind - all the way to our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor when he starts, he finishes impressioning.
I just decided not to work in a stand-up, because this thing about getting an instant reward from a full room full of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you're always going for it, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work at Apollo Airtime when I want to, but mostly, I don't get as much fun as I used to get.
I'm asking if he'll ever give me a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road -- I don't think I ever want to give it up.
So this is his new embodiment?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and there's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify “invisible employees”
Kenya has begun the biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid will be informed in the Government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyata promised to reduce corruption in State structures after he came to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700000) a month is lost by payments to “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to enter bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, is reported by BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusiri of the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants are required to report to identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data are collected through biometric registration procedures, and are reported in a government declaration.
Anyone who fails to do so without a valid reason will be struck off the payroll and reported on it.
“This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government - thus putting an end to the problem of invisible workers,” said Ann Waiguru, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for Planning and Restructuring of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with the “confrontation” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “confrontation against the Government”, reported by local news agencies.
The police did not comment immediately on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Harriet Daily News.
Some of them had been involved in corruption detection activities in the past December, which had been aimed at vetting Government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and listening to a telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan (who was then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer vacation.
This day has traditionally been a big event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yazenyuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told expecting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony was not held in every school on September 1.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All of Ukraine, a huge Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastukhov, principal of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will be given the knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study has traditionally been marked by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons, and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead's face, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader she needs.
It is followed by a plume of fame from the banking world, the administration of the media and the internal circles of the Tori Party.
Indeed, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at Ban and Co, a consulting firm for global management, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the world of media in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, when she resigned when a male colleague held a lower position in the leading company of Pearson's.
They say her earnings are close to £1 million.
Her political ratings are also strong.
She was advised by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is Tori's former advisor.
Earlier in May, I called the Chairman's work a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but its structure has an inherent paradox.
The Council has two orientations: inside as the top management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but out as the voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
It is an almost unattainable duopoly that requires complete radical reform.
However, what new chairman would risk coming in, trampling and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he was to deprive himself of his job in the process.
It's a tough decision.
It wouldn't be that hard, so many people would be happy to see the BBC go down in size, once its powers, finances and status have been reviewed.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, inevitable licensing negotiations pose a particular risk to BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British acquire a share in the world’s most important media enterprise.
BBC tells a good story: it states that its results cover 96 per cent of households and cost each of them only 40p per day.
Moreover, it is clear that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The models of BBC's viewing and use have changed: now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope he found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
A tweet from a confirmed account by the Governor of Texas, Republican Rick Perry, on Sunday evening contained an offensive image of the D.A. from the Democrats, which is at the center of criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and followed by another one from Perry's account, where it was disavowed.
A tweet just posted from my account was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I removed it," reports later.
Perry’s assistants did not immediately respond to the messages with a request for comments.
Although the records were downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was actually publishing on that tape.
An earlier tweet contained an unflattering cartoon of Travis Rosemary Lemberg District Attorney, who was found guilty of driving intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry banned the funding of her office when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a grand jury in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The tweet says, "I don't always drive in a state of intoxication three times the acceptable blood alcohol level, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me that."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg's department did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed as a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, claiming that the law used to prosecute the Governor, who had been performing his duties for the longest time in Texas history, was vague, contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped state funding for $7.5 million to the State Department of Public Control, which is based in Travis County and pursues corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto has raised an official complaint from a left-wing public control group.
The tape of Perry's confirmed account is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming to the party's fifth convention in Iowa during its 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumours that he might withdraw from the game by tweeting a photo of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market is back to normal.
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England had turned to normal activity.
Homes in the capital were subject to intense demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble would push Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Peedley, founder and chairman of an elite building company, Berkeley, said on Monday, "From the beginning of this fiscal year, the market has returned to normal levels of transactions since the peak of 2013, adding that it provided a "stable working environment".
The London real estate market was successful during the recession, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
The city's prices jumped 18.5 per cent over the past year alone, compared with the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole, according to the Land Registry.
The average market prices for Berkeley’s private, affordable, and student schemes rose by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential house tax before the general election next May.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which imposed stricter loan conditions, would also reduce market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its projection of rising London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent, based on the fact that the trend in real estate prices had already begun to weaken.
Meanwhile, the volume of transactions fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas in London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, demand for houses in the capital has been very beneficial to Berkeley, raising sales to over £2.2 billion.
Mr. Peedley added, "The demand for the right product with good design and better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, sales have remained for the time being."
In June, the company reported that it sold 3,742 new houses this year until the end of April, almost one third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual income before taxes rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking before the company's annual meeting on Monday, Mr. Peedley reported that Berkeley's expected revenues for the year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, profits are expected for the whole year before taxes of £450 million are paid.
Berkeley's stock was held at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London stock market.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence are posted online by a hacker.
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th Annual American Film Academy Awards.
Photos of naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar Award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a catalogue of photographs of another 100 rising stars.
A representative of the Star of the Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and convicted the hacker of "a blatant invasion of privacy."
There's been a call to law enforcement, and they're going to pursue anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos originally posted on the 4chan photo exchange site are believed to have been obtained due to a lack of online storage of Apple iCloud, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims of the break-in includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rianna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's not clear how many of these photos are true, although the star Scott Pilgrim against all of them, Winstead on Twitter, also condemned the break-in.
"The one who looks at the photos we took with my husband a few years ago when we were alone at home, I hope you're proud of yourself," tweeted Winstead on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, from Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victoria the Winner" series, denied that she was in the photos, tweeting: "These are the so-called photos of me naked, FALSHIVKI, people.
Let me stop it in the bud.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the spokesperson for pop star Ariane Grande denied that the photos she was supposed to be in were real.
Exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J," which was praised by critics.
They dissolved, best to put it this way, they gradually collapsed, like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only sometimes did a woman tell him that he was too serious, too hard to communicate, too tense, too closed, and maybe a little irritating.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw himself as irritating.
He was like a hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this harrowing was a little novel from which he expected more than usual to be rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a trembling, fragile beauty, with broken hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even more distant and harsh than Port Royben.
She came south with a companion who was older than herself, whom Kevern thought was her aunt, and the latter inherited a house in a damp, but similar to a paradise valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, spiders were sitting still in the tubs, slugs left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was spread over by weeds like giant cabbages.
It was like a cottage in a children's book, at the same time scary and charming, with a complete secret garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the Longlist of the Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eileen were sitting hand-in-hand in broken shazlongs among the tall grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they were both distracted by the cheap console that provided the country with peaceful music and comforting news when, when he looked at her crossed brown feet, he remembered an old song by a long forgotten black artist, whom his father liked to listen to by putting the curtains down in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their aggressiveness, these types of songs were no longer lost on the consoles.
They weren't banned - nothing was actually banned - just they weren't lost anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the very word "archical."
Public taste did what people could never have done with orders and prescriptions, and just as among books people chose the memoirs of the rich who grew up in poverty, the cookbooks and the romance novels, from all the music they chose the ballads.
After this day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and a crude comic voice singing Eileen's big legs.
Eileen didn't get it.
"It was a popular song by a jazz piano player called Fats Waller," he said to her, with two fingers in his mouth.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it flew off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start with "J," forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game back then, and it wasn't much fun right now.
He knew it was supposed to be him, that's all.
He had to explain jazz.
Eileen never heard him.
Jazz wasn't playing, either, even though it wasn't openly banned.
Improvisation's out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the tune started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with wit.
His unpredictability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was witty, expressed through music.
Although he was 10 years old, never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about the jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no law or pressure.
The society was obedient, which meant that each segment of it agreed with the gratitude -- the gratitude of those who were saved by fate -- with the principle of group predisposition.
Afro-Caribbean people, by their temperament and physical characteristics, were well suited for entertainment and sports, and they sang and ran.
The people of India, as if by nature talented in everything about electronics, have taken action to ensure that no family is left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was sanitary work; what was left of the Greek was broken by a plate.
People from the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose grandfathers did not leave the country quickly when what had been produced, if anything had happened, feared that they would be accused of burning the flames, fearing, in fact, that the flames would consume them next, opened up restaurants with gills and gills, kept their heads down and longed for idleness.
Everyone's capable.
Since she had only heard ballads before, it was hard for Eileen to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just said to her could even be put on music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the garden that was launched gave him the illusion of safety.
No word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant leaves that looked like cabbages.
Eileen still didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to press two fingers against her lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She shook her head in confidence, closing Cavern's eyes.
There was nothing in the whole world but a dig of her isin' black hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining in her mind.
But it still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say, no.
My ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverted.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to make jokes often led him into awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to, too, Kevern.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and rose from the coat of mail, overturning the console and strait of the wine they drank.
Buzine wine, so intoxication couldn't justify it.
In her excitement, she seemed trembling like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
I don't like it, though.
He felt sorry for her, for the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that she was basically like the one here.
The same huge ice ocean fell on both of them.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and cranky after what has been done, have wandered in fury from pub to pub, willing to raise their hand against any woman who dared to deny them or to tease them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
At first, a kiss is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the freshwater ballads that gave out the console is to kiss it first and then hit it.
A little too much clarification, in the view of Kevin, because the kiss itself was already hooliganism.
Eileen Solomon's body showed him to leave.
He came up from the shazlong like an old man.
She herself felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him go away, and from the top window she watched him go away, her companion was a man who himself had to bear the burden.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and for men at all, even though some of them raised their hand against her.
The man who turned his back on her, with her back bent, ashamed, battled, all the ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember a single case until today, when she would have seen it?
Again, Eileen Solomons alone looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or about that Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Ofnau, an unofficial public mood control service, produced a small report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decrease if it did not stop altogether, given the resources and resources allocated to its eradication.
“Many things have been done, and many things have been done,” she wrote, “to mitigate the innate aggression of people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow stubbles of the church, where, despite the plowing of the fences, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
However, some of the qualities appear to be inexorable.
The higher the spire, it seems, the lower the passions it generates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of overcome obstacles and announces its strong belief in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does old roughness maintain its strong grip in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is evidence that new and vicious bullying is emerging in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate habit of writing too much," said its research manager, reading the whole report.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped her head.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I'm asking," said Luther Rabinowitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We're not prejudiced here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, perfectly acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, like the ones you've shown me.
Obviously, you're prejudiced against the church yourself, and what you call "evil" and "gross" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural life and energy.
To keep wanting to know what has been done, if anything has happened, as if it happened yesterday, is to deprive the country of its vital strength.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, pink like flamingos, LED letters repeated the advice that "Ofnau" had given the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your husband, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, the word of a song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you're saying," replied Esme Nussbaum quietly when she made sure that her research manager had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything other than that we haven't recovered as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I'm concerned that if we're not ready, we'll find that we're repeating the mistakes that originally led to what's been done, if anything has happened.
Only this time, we will throw out our anger and mistrust on no one else.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips together in a pyramid.
That gesture was meant to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling "mistakes" actions that our grandfathers did or didn't do.
You go too far, and when you talk about how they threw their anger and mistrust at other people.
In your position, a person should not need to be reminded that, understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” or “they”.
There was no "us" and there were no "others."
It was a time of turmoil, that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with herself, she dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what's done is done.
It was back then.
You don't have to say anything else, we agree.
And as you don't blame anyone, you don't have to justify it if it's appropriate or if there's anything you can fix.
But why the past, if not to learn--
The past exists to make us forget it.
If I can add one word to that--
Luther Rabinovich's pyramid fell apart.
"I'll look at your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went to the sidewalk, as the passers-by were described, "in anger."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho Army states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The Lesotho Army denied preparations for a coup to overthrow the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police, who had been suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in Maseru capital.
The Premier took his family to neighboring South Africa, claiming that he had received the threat of an attempt on his life.
Major Ntlele Ntoi, the army spokesman, stated that there had been no coup in fact, but that the army had responded to the threat posed by “political fanatics” whom the police had tried to arm.
“What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action after receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements within the police force that were actually planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were willing to cause chaos”, he told the American Voice.
The South African government spokesman, Clayson Monjela, said that the army's actions looked like a coup.
“Although no one has claimed the seizure of power by force, according to all accounts, the actions of Lesotho's armed forces so far show the main signs of a coup”, he said.
The Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that they were calm in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing runs the government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his unified Government.
He stated that his actions had not undermined the Government, despite allegations to the contrary.
"Chelsey's quarterback, Marco van Ginkel, will spend the upcoming season on a rental basis at Milan, reports Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for medical examination.
In the last season, he only went to the London club field three times.
Let's remind you that Milan used to rent from Liverpool's attacker Fernando Torres.
Production in the eurozone at the lowest level in 13 months
Growth in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest level in 13 months in August, according to popular research.
The last value of the euro zone's production sector (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed, and businesses have suffered from growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
Values came to the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank to deal with the eurozone’s recovery, as well as the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3 per cent.
It is suggested that ECB leader Mario Dragi may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by Britain and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although any growth is better than no growth at all, the brake effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers becomes more evident," said Rob Dobson, the senior economist Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second-largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of great concern, as does the weakening of Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth momentum has lost mainly to the industrial engine, Germany, and Spain and the Netherlands also do not add to confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
A slowdown in industry is likely to add fuel to analysts awaiting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing to say about the August study of the eurozone's business index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: “The eurozone’s producers seem to find life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension – especially those related to Russia/Ukraine – adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This heightened tension has apparently hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "more and more like," that the ECB would, of course, have to do some sort of quantitative easing, "though we suspect it will be limited."
The people of Mariupol will turn a live chain against the militia.
In Mariupol, until last week, everything was quiet - no one was rushing to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, and the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are fearfully awaiting the arrival of the militia.
According to political scientists, separatists break into Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk was recently taken, and it was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army, while defending them, had little power against the excellent armed representatives of the DNR-LNR, and were ready to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and fortifications.
On the evening of Saturday, several thousand residents arrived at the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a living chain singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same in case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and transport equipment and products, collect medicines, and publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs are shut down.
Ten years of hell for Beslan survivors: Ten years since the terrible takeover of school, as children who find themselves in it still suffer.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day test, which shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who faked death during the school atrocities.
Exactly ten years after the terrible occupation of a school in Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors of the disaster warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be something of an extreme degree of evil.
Tragedy brought the east and the west together in disgust, which miraculously then turned into action and hope for the future in the face of great sorrow.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who deceived death during the school atrocities.
We've found amazing young people who stood up to the disaster, even though the memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now plagues Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
The girl in the picture trying to get back into the shooting gym.
It was captured in a photograph of a well-known Russian photographer, Dmitry Belyakov, when in one linen she tried to climb back into the shooting gym after the mine exploded.
At a loss, Aida was desperate to find her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them had died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I may need more surgery.
There's a few fragments left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people just as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but she certainly didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzer Gapov, was murdered there.
We played together when we were little, and we wanted to go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about my family later.
She says the capture stays with her, though the memories get a little dim every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our plight, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from the people of Britain and from all over the world.
When I see a picture on the Internet of me climbing through a school window, I think that a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
The boy who ran through a hail of bullets, believing his mother was dead.
It was his first day in school (the Russians start school at the age of 7) and survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamaru.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mother told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him to run.
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw the baby crying along the way, grabbed the child by the hand, and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara got out and was in the hospital with injuries on her feet, thinking her son was dead.
After they were reunited, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (now non-existent News of the World), where he was rewarded as the Protector of the Children of the Barnardo's Foundation, Premier Tony Blair, and his wife Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
After all, I can tell you that I'm losing sight of him.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played in the yard that never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted, and the car ride with the top open.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the grief that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who last week volunteered at a women's convent.
I want to help so much.
I want to be a police officer one day, and I hope I get enrolled in the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, aged 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence right after the capture, there were no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted many months.
She remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Sheri Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sheri and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and helping Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat the borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran off and played with him.
And it's only been a month since our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still think this world hasn't gotten any better in 10 years.
Now there's a war going on in Ukraine, people dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news report they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy doing something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and quiet boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not obsessed with this nightmare of the past.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym every once in a while and they light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning his back on us for hours.
No sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember when he threw away all his weapons and other war toys, and Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I find it hard to believe that for hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get back on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell all around me when the body parts were all over the place.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run, run," but again, I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgi Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking post-capture photo became the defining feature of the Beslan tragedy
Peace: Survivor of Beslan Georgi Ilyin and his mother Fatima after capture in 2004, and on the right George today
His bloody face had a mark of fear on it when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the chief doctor, took him to school on his first day of school before taking Vladimir's eldest son to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was alone for three days of nightmare," she remembered.
Not entirely alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia survived.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's not a day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The photo of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember that George so wanted to go to school that day, that he said he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of crying George in San Marino.
George doesn't like to see this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this picture is the way people around the world feel our pain.
George now says, "It's important that it never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, because how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need to take decades to forget her a little bit.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares about being captured, but now I'm feeling better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym before every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from high school this year and went to medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'll study to become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
Georgi Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived even though he was at the feet of a terrorist killer.
Unbelievable: George Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist killer during the capture, but he managed to survive.
During the capture, he was photographed in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist killer.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says George, who wanted to study as an intelligence officer at the FSB but was unable to do so because of the damage to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are easy to deal with bad things, and I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the following year, it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I passed out.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photo.
Survivor: George Farniev today with a laptop-opened photo of himself at the hospital after he was taken.
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
But health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second crush was animals, so I went to the Veterinary Institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals from cat to cow.
He said, "I know I'll never tell my children about my experience.
It's not something children should know, and of course it's not something they should be going through.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know George won't go.
It should be even stronger for him because he was there, and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
George is an adult now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say he's 50 percent over this nightmare, but it's impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and that only adds to my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm looking at what's going on in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were a friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could capture all the rebels and throw them as far away as you can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10 years old
A baby who was taken to safety by a SWAT fighter.
Rescued: Alyona Tskaev brings to safety a Russian Special Forces (left) fighter.
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember a terrible crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when little Alyona was taken out of a captured school in Beslan by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, her 10-year-old sister, Cristina, and Mahar's brother in the gymnasium of the school.
Mahar, then three years old, was saved, but Alainina's mother and sister died in a deadly massacre.
Her father, Ruslan, has since remarried, and she and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little daughter, whom he called Christine in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alyona, who is now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and blooms into a bright and cheerful girl, says the neighbors.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alyona and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them out of all the memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Sinji Kagawa's quarterback, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's Borussia, said that he was looking forward to going back to the German club.
According to him, this transfer is a happy career event.
Of course, I'm very happy to be playing for "Borussia" again, according to Bild, the words of Kagawa.
I feel really good.
Full of positive emotions and looking forward to going out to the Borussia field again.
Remember, Kagawa moved to MoU from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to join the English club, spending only 38 games in two seasons in the England Championships, beating six balls and giving eight assists.
A man is charged with assaulting a girl at a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
A 78-year-old man will stand trial for assaulting a three-year-old girl at a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at a crossing in Pittenwin in East Newke.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stewart had been leading his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and had hit a girl, causing her injury.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruster, denied his guilt in the Dundee sheriff's court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the Crown Counsel, set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel, and Holland won't cook in Vladivostok.
The duty-free mall of the Duty Free Airport of Vladivostok posted a sign prohibiting a number of world political leaders from buying at the store.
No perfume, vodka and cognac for them.
The store has decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, Vitaly Klitchko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Japan’s prime minister and several other prominent comrades will not be able to cook vodka, cognac and perfume in their store.
And she put a sign on the door.
Previously, Obama was banned from entering an even less accessible service, the Dyetic Catering Office, as reported by the public catering website.
Whether the American president ever wanted to eat food in a diet canteen in Russia is not known, but the banners clearly seem awfully witty to themselves.
Is there any cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the agrarians
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, believes that under the embargo, Russian agrarians should learn new technologies in order to produce the cheese varieties sought from buyers.
The advice was given during a visit to the Southpticprom company, Agrocomplex.
The Head of Government also advised the restaurant community to shift to Russian meat, the quality of which is at an appropriate level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since 7 August.
The chief coach of Russia's national team, Valentin Maslakov, is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, third place is a good result given the lack of targeted preparation for competitions.
Our athletes have performed at their own level, saying "All sports" by Maslakov.
Third place is to confirm our high-level command.
It's nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
You have to bear in mind that we haven't prepared for this competition.
The season is over, and we did not oblige our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we've been second in this tournament, but this season, we've got a new team.
The French, on the other hand, put out a capable team of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which has been publicly announced many times.
But even such a composition of competition owners could not stand up to the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were about as low as in the same Diamond League.
Season's over.
Of course, athletes no longer care about results, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing was the place.
And in the results, I agree, it was absurd when, at 1,500 metres, men were so obsessed with the tactical tweaking of the race that they showed the result below the average... of the women's races.
4 clues on how to improve the quality of underwater photographs and videos
If you want to photograph or film a video underwater, you have a variety of hardware options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof washhouse, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures on a family holiday with a few cameras, all at about $350.
Regardless of the equipment you use, several rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof chamber, make sure the chamber battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you're going to be taking.
Some photo and video cameras have camera modes or object types that optimize exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can go down.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's leadership and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots, because many of them won't work.
The latrines have an LCD that will help you compile the pictures, whereas the action cameras don't usually have them.
Even if you have an LCD, it's going to be hard to see underwater, and the frame layout is going to be a random process.
So do a few frames.
Also, if your camera has a serial camera mode that takes a few shots with a slightly different set of displays, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The amount of light falls significantly, the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you are filming in a pool, a river, or an ocean.
It will also allow you to transmit more color in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the target.
It's a great advice for land-based photography, but it's even more important underwater because of the dark light conditions.
It's especially important if you're filming an action camera: this equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you're going to have to approach the objects if you want to fill the frame.
The Bronze Prize of the 2012 Olympic Games for Free Fights by Bilal Mahov may turn into a Greek-Rome battle.
This was reported by Sajid Sajid Sajdov, the head coach of Dagestan's Free Fight.
A specialist did not exclude a sportsman from the 2014 Tashkent World Cup in September 2014.
Bilal Mahov is currently at the Classics team, citing "R-Sport" by Sajid Sajdov.
In fact, Bilal performed in both styles as a junior.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he became the winner of the volleyball tournament and the third prize in the Greek-Romen competitions and decided to concentrate on the free fight.
It has long been said that a new phase of our career will be spent by our heavyweight in the Greek-Rome struggle.
I'll tell you more, Mahov can play at the Tashkent World Cup if he wins the discount.
But the final word is always for the coach's headquarters, headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality could shake things up, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
An anaesthesiologist, he devoted his career to freeing patients from both the suffering of the disease and the suffering of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalled, was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors were obsessed with diagnosis and disease, those who were being treated were mostly concerned with something completely different-- pain.
One day in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
Fighting flu-like symptoms, he discovered that he was irritatingly blaming his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusual and unsure why he was upset.
Something wasn't right.
He asked a colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Only two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-ray results came back.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the pulmonary membrane.
For most cancers, it's hard to know the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But with mesothelioma, it's different.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called "the miracle," but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos is, after all, material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industrial recommendation ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: trumpet isolationists, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly a cause for concern today.
But that calm is wrong.
Britain appears to be at the height of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
Here, mesothelioma kills more people than any other country on the planet.
At an annual death rate of approximately 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease as from car accidents.
Annual mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason we feel its lethal effects now is that, although asbestos use has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were ultimately prohibited by law in 1999), mesothelioma usually takes decades to develop.
And the attack on mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, buried in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma ignores class, level of wealth, profession or age.
Bastilles of choice, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, proved not to be a rescue.
The Parliament building is pierced with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that were designed to treat us turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe-insulationr.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have had contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It seems there might have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's hospital, where I spent six years in an internship," he wrote.
Everyone -- students, nurses, doctors and movers -- used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
That was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who have been interned at Guy's Hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one who survived."
How many of us will get sick with this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live for so long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die eight months after diagnosis.
It's always lethal.
So now all we can do is repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to the leading mesothelioma expert in Britain, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely to be expected that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is about to die, some 900,000 people will die.
Most people now have no idea they're gonna die like this.
Asbestos Mine in Quebec, Canada
A quick look at court records, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the attack on mesothelioma has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen had been inadvertently exposed to asbestos.
She worked online for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't imagine it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They were named by the word "asbestiform", which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, tube insulation, boiler sutures, even in brake pads.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that could lead to death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are strong, albeit indirect, grounds for believing that this is the main cause of the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma patients [in Britain]”.
Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the company's main store on Oxford Street, London.
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of the patients which suggests that “a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known exposure at work or at home, is likely to have been caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment”.
Most of this exposure, he says, is due to the “normal use and impact of weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
Goddard Consulting's report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even in the middle of the government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees had been contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be driven by something as harmless as “strong airflows”.
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but the opposite seems to be true.
Although the Directorate of Maintenance of Parliament insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “clean health certificate”, it now recognized that there was a need to work on £1 billion to reconstruct Parliament by improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of Parliament might be meeting at the QE2 conference centre near Westminster’s green benches.
The Goddard report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed according to different regulations”.
It's impossible to know if this control error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who has never been able to detect their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, aged 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was struck by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of surgery late tonight.
Suddenly, I started to get feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pleura, the sheath around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it for testing.
Still, his condition was undiagnosed.
His health gradually improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms came back, often after he was playing sports and breathing hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to his room with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott ' s condition deteriorated again, and the doctor who consulted him showed his CT results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera sensor was inserted into the cavity between his chest and his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came back a week between Christmas and New Year's Eve, saying, "I've been told it's mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Mesothelioma diagnosed
Suddenly, Abbott sank into meetings with Macmillan’s nurses, one of whom suggested that he contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“Asbestos appears to have been widely used, especially in large public buildings where asbestos thermal insulation on pipes was quite common”, he said.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now infected with this disease.
So mesothelioma now strikes younger people in atypical occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many of the employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) almost certainly were exposed to a toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, lives were saved for the patients, but a place that threatened the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolmates put their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of their amazing isolation and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many were likely exposed to asbestos for the first time in class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry lessons, schoolchildren put their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
Websites have emerged to highlight asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things like floor tiles or shed roofs generally contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison embedded in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful with the garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
"It takes quite a while to realize it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to go and deal with myself.
Well, I'll never see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things to do was to move from being a doctor to being a patient.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information he had to accept.
"It was hard to understand," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I've been given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't see Christmas again.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it is the mechanics of how we support life -- the very act of breathing -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and fibers inhale, they can be stuck in the pleura, the pulmonary sheath.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises from inhalation of asbestos needle fibres”, Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, the leading mesothelioma treatment center.
The coach knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed to an intern at the hospital.
When the needles of asbestos fall into the tissue of the lungs, Treger says, "The breath pushes them out to the periphery where the shell is.
This is essentially an invasive process from the beginning.
Normal treatments for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is a source of heated debate.
Some people think it's worth a try.
I don't think so.
"It's impossible to cut the pleura," he says.
You can't walk around with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is "not very good at chemotherapy," which "acts" but does not cure.
"From time to time, there are sick people who live a long time," says Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after being diagnosed, became a single support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he was jolly talking when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six rounds of chemotherapy that would take four months to extend his life for only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson did, however, "determine to give everything a little more positive color."
Meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loick Lange-Lazundski, professor of thoracic surgery at Gaja Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a referral, I just called them, and they accepted me," admits Graham.
The average patient would have to receive referrals and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for mesothelioma patients in order to obtain the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment is finally inexorably ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern: the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small quantities could put health at risk.
That's when we talked about the bad faith of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a "full cost settlement," Morgan said, because Lawson couldn't prove conclusively that his mesothelioma was the result of asbestos contact at Guy's hospital.
After investigating his death, the representative of Gaja Hospital confirmed, however, that “the asbestos in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, linking lethal contact with asbestos to one company or workplace - usually decades later - has proved to be a major problem for mesothelioma patients who require compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed ownership or closed down.
Insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves from lawsuits know that they have a time that the plaintiffs certainly don't have.
In response this year, serious new legislation has been introduced that facilitates mesothelioma patients to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the Act, a £350 million fund financed by the insurance industry was established for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but have no one to sue.
In such cases, patients would receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a normal compensation case, approximately £120,000.
About 300 successful lawsuits under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal written by the insurers for the insurers”, he says, insinuating that a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay had it not been for the time interval and the mesothelioma patients would have been able to trace the company and file a claim in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly the Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was "indefinite."
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that while seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.
"People suffer so much, and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lange-Lazundski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazundski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lange-Lazundski boasts 40 per cent of the survivors in five years.
Abbott felt a rush.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some kind of power that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott signed up for surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots in my chest.
I was just about to turn 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no sign of tumors now.
However, the process is both physical and emotional.
You can think about practical things -- about finance when I die, or about showing my wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you're not happy.
We need to look ahead.
As Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamsin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I first got diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I can't live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
This kind of conversation is something that everyone with cancer has to face.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced by hope, not even by the prospect of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not a threat to life.

Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage caused by exposure to asbestos in Great Britain.
Global asbestos production rises to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tons.
The British Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires all contractors working with asbestos to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in Britain.
All asbestos use is banned in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act was adopted in the United Kingdom.
The compensation scheme of £350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
World production has been maintained at approximately 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters vow revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to run for election in 2017 despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of a long-awaited protest in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People ' s Congress essentially allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't betray our expectations, but it still enrages us," said the lawmaker Emily Lau, the president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's people.
And obviously, we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defending China's decision, Lee Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that it would be too "chootic" to allow the popular election of Hong Kong's leader.
Since 1997, when Great Britain handed over control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to elect a head of government by vote, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands through a nomination commission strictly controlled from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision was made after the summer, when one of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong over the years took place.
A large part of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is led by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to shut down the Hong Kong financial area if Beijing did not guarantee real universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstrations, the organizers stated that their movement was moving into a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise in protests in the following weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other option.
It is with great regret that we report that, to date, all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the seizure of the central region will no doubt take place.
Public authorities in Hong Kong were preparing for Beijing's application for several days, and security measures were reinforced at Government headquarters on Sunday, with the involvement of the police and barricades.
At the heart of the unrest is the feeling in many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
Inflows from the mainland increase competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put business at risk, the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protest they're talking about can result in a great economic loss, depending on how many people will be involved and how long," said legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control to spread.
It's a perception that's bad for investment.
Chinese state media have also been reporting in recent days in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement have been shown by Western-Power sabotagers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands came to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
American prom culture reaches university life: freshmen were invited to come on a private plane
We are pleased to respond to such a demand by launching the first Lux travel service in the UK for current students.
To give a vivid impression of arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options such as a private plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service was thinking of safety.
This service is the ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their things across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping this year's students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
The representative of the company said that since the service had just been launched, orders had not yet been received, but added that “students will start ordering the service in the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that although students had to pay £9000 a year, it hoped to find a market for the service.
Today’s students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized this service as being disconnected from reality.
Megan Dunne, Vice President of the NSS for Higher Education, said, "This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many of the students who will start university this month face a cost-of-living crisis, when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants falls short of rapidly increasing spending on basic needs before they can even begin to think of spending thousands of pounds on some sort of simple arrival in the dormitory.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come up raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot" while they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, related to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, the white feminists who left comments placed gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as the tension in the Midwest grew and national attention became apparent, Peres saw white women’s responses, which focused on 100 per cent race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the 9 August murder, personal essays with headlines such as “thinking about Ferguson on behalf of a white woman” and “Feminism is not just about oppression of women” were relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there's a lot of people talking about white skin and privileges at this high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic for the crisis we're facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so related to race, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For a professor of English at the University of Ohio, Corita Mitchell Ferguson exposed problems that black American women face every day but that are not perceived as “women's problems” in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and get 150 likes from everywhere," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?" she asks.
For black women, like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly separate those problems; they faced a difficult reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Before 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, almost always based on the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
It took a white woman to confirm the story to justify the lynching.
From Hattery's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragists, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for electoral rights would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in a basket of women's voting rights, and the right to vote for blacks was supposed to come later," said Hattery.
Looking back at these things gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained voting rights in 1920, it took 10 years for white women to unite against lynchings in the Southern Women's Association for the Prevention of Vigilance.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
From Mitchell's point of view, the rise of white feminist reactions to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to “hear” the problems that black women had dealt with in several generations.
"Truly, it would be great if activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideology would take as seriously the right to raise a child as they do the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
A well-known white activist of the feminist movement, Gloria Steinem, took advantage of Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's murder and published a harsh article by the Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans be more involved in racist protests.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the views on racial issues that differ significantly in public interviews - will be at the forefront of change," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem is charged with more intersecting feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
Researcher Christine Sommers of the American Business Institute, author of Who Stealed Feminism?, said She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, were "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinham's remarks about Ferguson contradicted earlier criticisms.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Watch, to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem promoting traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-west border this year, immigration reform came back to the surface, this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to bring the problem to bear on women, she just had to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of workers are granted [male immigrants] visas, the women who come with them find themselves in a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich house with a pig is for sale.
A photograph of a house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to be a large pig resting in the living room.
For £120,000, a separate house with one bedroom stands on a private road in Ipswich.
A detailed description was provided by a photograph of the living room of a pig with a head on the couch.
The Connells Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the photograph is the home favorite of the owner of the house.
“However, the photograph was placed by mistake and has already been deleted”, said the representative of the company.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as "a unique separate house with one bedroom".
Although the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still retained in promotional material.
The sale of the house generated interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was being sold with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in a fourth round US Open match, the yielding Caroline Wozniatsky, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to complete the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, passing Vasily OSIPO from New York.
How do you generally assess your results at the Big helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't even get to the quarterfinals.
What challenges do you have before the end of the season?
After a bitter defeat, I have a huge motivation to step up to a new level.
I have a lot to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year with dignity.
The Asian series starts in a couple of weeks.
Member of the State Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolay Valuev, has proposed to give bonuses on admission to higher education for compliance with the rules of the GTO.
He said that, in general, the standards would be the same as in Soviet times - people would pass the standards of attraction, running and other exercises.
Let us recall that 12 Russian entities will begin to implement the GTO standards on their territory as of 1 September.
I also suggested that the students who had given up the GTO should give them a bonus on admission to higher education, notes Valuev.
For example, they can add a little bit to the EGE.
There are also suggestions to give additional rest time to employees of enterprises who have undergone these sports trials.
Harvey's town in South Wales has a new millionaire after winning the lottery.
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is being sought southwest of Perth, where one lucky guy will take home almost $1.1 million from a lottery prank on Saturday night.
Harvey's newsstand brings gold to the top prize for the second time in five years, last winning $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to be declared.
The owner of the shop, Steve Forward, said that the winnings had triggered an uproar in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole town is talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought it might be a secret win.
Eight West Australian winners celebrated their winnings last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires of August, followed by a huge $7.5 million win for a couple from Belmont just a few weeks before.
The winning couple had been playing for 20 years and reported that the winnings had given them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners to 59 in Western Australia this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mine-development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market.
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the Government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, telling the Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry, Oleg Pluzhnikov, on a round table that was held at the Moscow Motor Show 2014.
The plan was commissioned by the Government, and one of the main objectives was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September and early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of gas-fuelled vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy of it is available from the Vedomostis) is for the period 2014 - 2017.
Criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport have to be developed and how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the Government describing tax and customs support measures for electrical transport will be prepared by December 2014; a concessionary loan and concessionary leasing scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machinery, promote localization and establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014 - 2015, amendments to the regulations are envisaged to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (parks, petrol stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities in the course of 2015 to also encourage the use of clean transport, in the form of providing it with advantages in driving and parking, for example; and by February 2016, to expand government procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of indicators for assessing the performance of regional authorities criteria reflecting the effectiveness of supporting cleaner transport production and the development of charging infrastructure.
The Russian electric vehicle market is still developing - about 100 electric vehicles sold throughout the country in 2013.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric vehicles was zeroed, so sales would be about 500, as predicted by the Chief Executive Officer of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But the five-fold increase does not make the electric vehicles visible: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million cars and light commercial cars were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors are imported into Russia.
Renault is being prepared to start imports, a company that focuses on corporate clients, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Renault Partnerships in Russia Nicolas Remiz.
Most other electric transport producers, however, have taken a wait-and-see position with regard to Russia.
Russian manufacturers also have "", "GAZ", "but the output is minimal.
For example, between January and July 2014, according to ASM-Holding, AutoWAZ released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the director of AutoWAZ in engineering Sergei Amanov, without the upper hand, there will be no breakthrough in this segment...
The development of the Russian electric vehicle market in addition to the expensive cars (the electric vehicles that are sold in Russia, on average twice as expensive as internal combustion engines), constrains the development of the charging infrastructure (refuelling units), and the CEO of “Autostat” Sergei Slykov sighs.
Due to the high cost and low rate of cost reduction, electric vehicles will remain a niche segment of the Russian market in the next three to four years, forecast by the editor-in-chief of Avtorew, Mikhail Podrozhansky, who agrees with it.
On the other hand, automakers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional vehicles.
The Russian electric vehicle market has good prospects, and the most important is to instil consumer confidence that “electric mobility” is real; this will be facilitated, in particular, by the emergence of new charging stations, as underlined by the President of the BMW group Wolfgang Schlimme in Russia.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by Rosetti: several stations have been built in Moscow and about 80 more will soon be available.
Negotiations are also under way with other regions for the construction of a gas station network.
According to Vladimir Sofiyin, director of the Rosseti department, the company believes in the market for electric vehicles and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles with various brands.
In addition, Rosetti, as a network company, is not allowed to sell electricity, and the possibility of doing so is being explored with respect to the charging of electric vehicles.
Pankow considers the most effective measure to support the establishment of an electric vehicle market in Russia to be the zeroing of customs duties.
The zero rate will remain in effect until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it and expanding the preferential list is being explored.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and applied to all machines) will also support the market, but not as much as the customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Russia’s transport tax is small, says Pankov, unlike Norway, for example, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sales of electric vehicles – they now account for 12 percent of the market.
In Russia, there is also a need for incentive measures for car owners, such as free parking in the city centre (as already done in Moscow), sure as Pankov, or the possibility of electric vehicles moving along the designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
A single-engine Piper PA-46 crashed in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it died, handing over ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometres from the airstrip of Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
The Donetsk region handles the captured fighters of the Donbas battalion.
The jailers were surrounded by Ilowayski.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of silos died under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the real situation was in south-eastern Ukraine, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be described as lucky.
The Donbassbat pilots survived the meat-cutting they were hit by under Ilowayski.
In the midst of the army of the Donetsk People ' s Republic, the militants spent a few days effectively abandoned by their commanders and the Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from the headquarters that it was possible to get out of the ring along the allegedly provided corridor, the convoy moved.
But just a few minutes later, shells and bullets were blowing from all sides.
"On the basis of the information they gave me, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," says the deputy battalion commander, who has the name "Lermont."
And when we went down between Polypole and Chervonoselskiy, crossfire started from anti-tank guided missiles, from guns, 30-millimetre grenade launchers, BMD automatic guns, and small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three in the back, and there were only two cars left.
The Lermontian officer tells us that almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, and many died later.
Survivors are now being treated by those they came to kill.
The prisoners are now surprised that the so-called “terrorists” treat them well, provide food, medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned them to certain death.
They said, "We have been betrayed.
The convoy, the entire battalion, to be destroyed.
In the Donbass battalion, like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered because Ukrainian news reported atrocities allegedly committed by “separatists” in the south-east.
Alexei has already seen a very different picture here.
His mother was killed in Luhansk, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian soldiers.
A friend called me, told me that mortar fire was going on, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, a soldier, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
They didn't let us out of Iloweisk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already made a deal with the commander, and I've already written the report on the departure.
We were taken to Iloweisk from Zurakhov's tolls.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people are trapped in the "kotla" under Ilowayski.
Some survivors now admit that if time could be reversed, they would never join the punitive battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over by the militia to the DNR.
Everyone will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
The region has established a food price control headquarters
A headquarters has been established in Krasnoyarsk province, which will limit, if necessary, the increase in the price of products in the region ' s market.
The decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the Government of the province, representatives of the executive branch and the supervisory departments.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the province.
The Economy - Will Kiev pay the Rosneft $140 million in damages?
Igor Sechin, head of Rosnefti, stated that the company estimated the damage caused by the shooting of the Lisican NPP in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government for compensation," Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the Lisičan PNP, which had been upgraded by the company, was planned for 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fighting, there were no rebels, but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, technological oil pumped into the pipes has gone missing," he said.
As will be recalled, on 18 July, the oil storage tank was burned and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed in connection with the shooting of the Lisican NPP.
The Lycian NPP is the main refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of which was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisican NPP is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro 4 fuel as well as Euro 5 fuel lots.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisican NPP were suspended due to its loss.
At the plant, it was decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisican NPP along with other Ukrainian assets of TNCs-VR.
The DPRK launched a short-range missile towards the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, this happened around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando Province, which is on the North Korean-China border.
According to Interfax in the Joint Committee of South Korean Chiefs of Staff, the missile allegedly landed in the Sea of Japan after flying some 220 kilometres.
The ruble falls against geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow exchange, the dollar rose by 3 cops to 37.15 roubles, and the ruble fell to the double-currency basket against a backdrop of geopolitical tension.
ETS bidding for a dollar started at 37.11 to 37.2 roubles/$1, with an average of 37.16 roubles/$1, up by 4 cops over the previous closure.
The euro had a rate of 48.79 roubles per euro, which is three more cops than the previous closure.
The price of the bi-currency basket added 3.5 cops to 42.395 roubles.
The US dollar trades 23 cops above the official rate, and the euro sells 16 cops above the official rate.
The Russian market continued its rapid decline on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He continued to cheapen the ruble and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are now pre-empting the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
So far, however, this is more like an artificial hysteria, bloated through the media, especially the Western ones.
There are few options for imposing new sanctions on the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, unless we see a new negative in the near future, both Russian indices and the position of the national currency may be adjusted.
Orenburg Airlines will be sued by Ideal Tour.
The Orenburg Airlines filed claims against Ideal Tour for a total amount of 4.7 billion roubles.
These are two cases that will be heard in October.
There will be different judges dealing with cases.
According to Interfax, the first claim was filed on 14 August.
It's a little over 425 million rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 7 October.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
It's worth 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Tourist Union, the judges for cases are different.
In July, information appeared in the media about the debts of Ideal Tour to Orenburg Avilia in the amount of 1.5 billion rubles.
Victor Zükin, the CEO of the airline, is talking about 1.6 billion rubles.
The CEO of Aeroflot, Vitaly Saviliev, calls an even larger sum of two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
Twitter's microblog service has changed the user registration process to more quickly involve new players in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have dropped their microbloggings.
The new Twitter users will now view a large number of accounts recommended by the service at the time of the registration, so that they can immediately draw up their own reading circle.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests stated at the time of registration.
Twitter then automatically ticks to the subscription box for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to take the ticks off his/her hand so that he/she does not read people he/she is not interested in.
While previously microblogging users had only seen the avatars of recommended users, Twitter now produces a sample of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help impress a person.
This is the largest change in the Twitter account in the last three years.
Twitter has recently been active in upgrading the service.
This activity is primarily related to the continuing attempts of the service to achieve a failure.
In 2014, the microblogging service experienced a slowdown in user base growth and a decline in reader activity.
The company is in desperate need of more loyal resources from consumers who, once in a while, would have stayed for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
Moscow’s Knowledge Day will be cold and rainy.
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day, as reported by meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow will be between 16 and 18 degrees, and in Moscow it will be between 13 and 18 degrees.
The rains will be rained in cloudy weather, and the wind of the eastern quarter will be quite weak - only 3 to 8 metres per second.
Vehicle disposal programme resumed on 1 September
As of 1 September, Russia has resumed its motor vehicle recycling programme.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, Denis Mantourov, explained, the money is allocated from the limits already passed to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redeployment from other support lines.
The programme will cover all vehicles over six years of age.
The compensation will range from 40,000 for a car to 350,000 roubles for a truck.
A similar vehicle recycling programme had already been in place in Russia.
The main difference in the current project, the Minister explained, is that it is now envisaged not only to dispose of machines to obtain a subsequent discount, but also, if the vehicle has reached the age of more than six years, to purchase a new one with a discount when the old one is given to a dealer in a trade-in, Interfax will transmit it to Interfax.
More than 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal disposal programme, which lasted from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
As a result, passenger car production in 2010 was about 1.2 million (which is plus 101.4 per cent in 2009).
The Creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game Designer Nikki Keys, famous for the game "Coming Out Simulator", decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case began work on the game a few weeks ago, but it is only now widely known.
The inspiration for the game came from events in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be how the coverage of stories affects their impact.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will have to take pictures of what's going on in areas where there's clashes between the police and the public.
A hero can take different pictures of what's going on, which will affect the course of events.
If he makes a scene that makes the police look like heroes and the protesters look like bandits, the police will start to treat him better and let him go where a normal person can't go.
If he covers events differently, his photos could turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
The points in the game will have to be dialed with the character's Twitter, which will show new followers if the photos posted there are popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of the release and the platform on which it appears are unknown.
The case, however, published an image showing how the event could change depending on how the photograph about it was made and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Case, he explained that he had been considering the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to devote it to events in the Gaza Strip rather than to protests in the United States.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the region's history.
However, when he saw the media covering events in Ferguson, he decided to play the game on the basis of what had happened.
Nikki Keyes is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which covers events from Keyes' own biography, focuses on how a bisexual teenager tries to communicate his/her relationship to homophobic parents.
Geletei is dragging Ukraine into further bloodshed.
In an appeal to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Valery Geletei, has dragged the people into a bloody confrontation, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Geletey, who declared “the completion of an operation to free the eastern part of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of a “great domestic war” in which losses would amount to “tens of thousands”.
The adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the post on his Facebook page, is a subject for study by specialists in the non-military field,” says a report by Russian diplomats.
They have difficulty believing that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “On unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if resistance continued, they would use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
He stated, however, that the “operation to liberate the eastern part of Ukraine” had been completed.
Perez Hilton deleted all intimate images of the stars and apologized.
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars have been horrified.
The hackers hacked primitive passwords in the iCloud (data warehouse) in smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on blogger Perez Hilton's website.
Really, not for long.
Let's remind you, Star Official Jennifer Lawrence has already reported the theft of photos from her cell phone, and he has confirmed that all the images that are "shining" online are authentic.
Perez Hilton, the creator of the same-named tabloid site, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues in the workshop for publishing their candid images, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
I haven't been contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to delete the frank photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," tweeted by a blogger.
However, all frank photographs of the stars have already spread over the Web.
David Beckham was in a car accident hiding from the paparazzi.
David Beckham was in a motorcycle accident fleeing the paparazzi.
It happened in Los Angeles on the corner of Sunset Boulevard.
The British football player got rid of the bruise and sprain of his right arm.
Beckham got out of the tattoo parlor where he was waiting for paparazzi.
Fleeing from their motorcycle chase, he failed at the turn and fell down, writing TMZ with a reference to sources close to the football player.
As a result, Beckham sustained a bruise, a sprain of the muscles of his right hand, and a scratch.
Tony Stewart is in an accident returning to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track was a little more than in the middle of the Atlantic Motor Speedway race.
Stuart crashed into the wall the second time after his right front tire broke on 172 laps, ending his performance.
Stuart took his broken car to the garage and then walked out without talking to the reporters.
His team leader, Chad Johnston, said that 14 members of the team were upset, but now they're going to focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better chance and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and I hope we can do better there.
Stuart first ran into a wall earlier in a race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty big hope of coming to the finish line," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded onto a tow truck, and the team assembled and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Spring Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver in a dirt race in northern New York.
He decided to come back this week, and he needed to win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to take part in the pursuit.
He returned to work during an investigation into a tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went on the road to express his dissatisfaction with Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the investigation of the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
It was not decided whether Stuart would be charged.
Three times, the champion was greeted with loud cheers and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting from position 12, Stuart walked in the first ten at the beginning of the race, reaching position four.
Then on the 122th lap after the re-launch of Bush's number.
Car 18 descended from the trajectory at turn 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart went on, but he's down to position 21.
Sobchak and Vitorgan have breakfast with Zwanecki in Odessa.
Xenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV host did not hesitate to report in her Instagram.
True, one photograph surprised and embarrassed the couple’s fans.
The photo was taken from Zwanetski.
"Michael Mikhalych of Zwanetschi Maxim explains what Instagram is:) #dessa," signed a photograph of Xenia Sobchak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no buns, no butter...
The couple’s fans decided that Ksyusha also smoked, and convicted her for doing so.
"Whose cigarettes?, "Smoking kills!", "Some cigarette breakfast" , "If only for breakfast and cigarettes on the table") ) , "Ksenia, are you smoking?" were worried about her favorite blog subscriber.
Remember, Sobchak recently bragged about the delicious dinner that Maxim Vitorgan made for her for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the house, and your husband has prepared dinner by your arrival (for the first time for marriage, but what a delicious thing to do at the end of dinner, so that he doesn't say in the words of anecdotal: "To be like this every day now," boasted her husband Xenia Sobchak.
The picture shows that Maxim is working hard on something, and the table already has salts and baked chicken.
Bulgarian prison officials held a national protest
Hundreds of prison officers from all over Bulgaria held a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia, the capital.
During a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the old working conditions that had recently been changed.
Wage increases are also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the Acting Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov.
During the month, the officers expressed symbolic protest against the new schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the Prison Service Union had met several times with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement had been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (PNR) reported.
Negotiations are ongoing, as reported by the BNR to Rosen Jeliazkov, head of the Directorate-General for the Execution of Sentences.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest of the Prison Service Union.
The Army Controls Thailand’s New Government
General Prayt (right) appointed the Minister of Defence, Edith Wongsuwan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayat Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of a new Cabinet of Ministers in which more than one third of the posts are held by generals or retired generals.
Representatives of the army have been given key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praiat Chan-Ocha was officially confirmed as Prime Minister after the King of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the provisional military government.
The 60-year-old military who took power in the country in a bloodless coup of 22 May was the only candidate for the Premier post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary meeting.
Previously, the army had appointed MPs.
According to Praia Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat ' s Government.
The official Prime Minister, Praiat Chan-Ocha, will be temporary, as the military plans to hold general elections by the end of 2015.
However, there are concerns that the military is trying to strengthen its authority in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
Against the backdrop of a complete paralysis of the civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army removed Brother Yinglyk Chinawat Thaksin as Prime Minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has ensured their success in the elections on many occasions.
However, many members of the middle class and the metropolitan elite have joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralysed the country since November 2013.
No one said the mussel salad would be better, I didn't promise you that, and the waitress from the new Palm brasser is banging on you.
It has to be formally acknowledged that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain steadfast.
Because everyone's known for a long time that we say "Belgium" -- we mean mussels, we say mussels -- we mean "Belgium."
Restaurants like to argue in depth that the success of the institution depends on three factors: the location, the location, and once again the location.
There's places like this that aren't so good, they're so great, but they're kind of bad luck.
Anyway, when I sat down at Palm's table, I remembered that there was once a Café Town (in honor of that same TV show), then Odessa Mama, and a restaurant Bojole and a beer friend.
Now it's beer again, but it's not nostalgic Soviet anymore, it's Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg was placed above the ground: a bar and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space was deprived of even a hint of sunlight.
But it's fun here, like the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows, TVs where girls swim.
Belgian institutions in Petersburg have been a long way from being new, so there's something to compare to.
There are eight types of spill beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 litre) and countless bottles (170-1550 rubles).
A positive company waitress presents the menu with fun, saying, "Media are full big seeds," and it should be noted that service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected by content, but often very unexpected by execution.
Well, for example, someone's got to predict that a Walloon prunes meatloaf (280 rubles) is actually carpaccio, cut so thinly, that parchment paper would look uglyly fat compared to it.
The only way you can feel any taste is if you're half-cocked.
It's worse with salads.
The classic Leugean (260) would be the most appropriate crime against the Belgian people: some dried iceberg, once cooked a long time ago, a potato that had melted Kenyan beans, wooded bacon chips, plus some marinated onions.
You won't want to meet anyone with a lion salad like that!
The composition of the ingredients of Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If it was still possible to close your eyes to under-ripened worms or over-cooked shampignons, why do the mussels look like they've been defrosted several times in their lives?
I already know there are perfectly normal white-maritime mussels here!
They're served in pots "in sauce for your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, white wine, celery and carrots, didn't really work out.
There's vegetables, but there's no fragrance, and there's no wine, and it's still a mystery.
At least they're good for mydia fritas with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken waters in here are not hors d'oeuvres, thick to the point that depending on the mood, you can decide whether the first or the second dish is in front of you, but just a nice cream soup.
It was stated that the rabbit was made by a local chef in beer sauce, and there was no mention of rosemary.
The opposite was true: the rosemary had silenced everything.
The rabbit appeared to have been fed exclusively with rosemary bushes during his lifetime, which gave the meat such an extraordinary fragrance.
But the rabbit's leg was accompanied by a great -- no, just a great pear in a caramelized crust.
Walfs in Palm offer not only sweet but also full - beef, chicken, or bacon, and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was too watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in the lunch impressions.
Then we should come again.
The dollar rose over 37 rubles on the news of new Western sanctions against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
By 10:29 p.m. tomorrow, the dollar rose by 26.9 kopecks to 37.02 rubles, and the euro rose by 30.73 kopecks to 48.73 rubles, as shown by the Moscow Exchange.
The currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and was worth 42.28 roubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar peaked on February 19, 2009, at 36.43 roubles, and on March 3, 2014, it was 37.005.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The ruble reduction is long-term, a pair of euros and a pair of dollars.
The long-term forecast suggested this,” says Anna Bodrova, chief analyst of the Alpari.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in one way or another in the course.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumours about the invasion of troops have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has been very emotional.
All the talk about him being resistant to news like this was erased yesterday.
The week is projected to close at these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, policy, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links to the same chain.
Inflation is also projected to accelerate, with current autumn prices ranging from 5 to 10 per cent.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruit will soon run out, and there will be a vacuum as the networks shift to other suppliers.
"Dollar came up to the 37 rubles mark, passed it and came back, there's no powerful hysteria," comments the market analysis director of Open Broker Konstantin Bushuyev.
They will still see whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The Rubel, he said, was sharply weakened after the tax season ended, followed by news on Ukraine, and last week, the CD stated that before the end of the year, it was moving completely to a floating rate and was renouncing any currency intervention.
Looking at the day-to-day hesitation, it was no different than the previous one during this month, and it was the 37 rubles mark that scared everyone, and the analyst continues.
And so, nothing big has happened in terms of turnover.
An alarming time for the currency market was, I recall, when there was a strong demand for currency at the end of January, as well as on the third March, when the CD shipped record amounts of currency.
In UFS IC, the positive side of the ruble is also seen.
First of all, this is an increase in the export revenues of the budget, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through higher import prices, as pointed out by Alexei Kozlov, chief analyst of UFS IC.
One of the negative aspects is the cost of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, fuel inflationary pressures and, as a result, increase the cost of borrowing, which in turn hinders the country’s economy.
In the case of the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat mitigates the decline in stock prices expressed in the rubles.
For example, the MMWR index fell by 1.67 per cent during the Thursday tender and the RTAs index lost 3.27%.
This significant difference in the relative decline in the indices is due to a decline in the ruble during the day of more than 1.5 per cent.
The relaxation of the ruble is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy currency.
Practice has shown that emotions are gradually eroding, and ruble quotations are partially or completely restoring lost positions.
"We believe we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," Alexei Kozlov notes.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
British says she spent many years thinking she was going to die after a misdiagnosis.
Carin Rogers spent most of her adolescence thinking she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charco-Marie-Tut's disease, a group of hereditary disorders that result in nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMTs because so little is known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are believed to have CMTs that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, insecure walking, and strained toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and their condition is not cured and progressing, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's (AF) attack, a condition for which the prognosis was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be chained to a wheelchair by the time she's 18, and she'll be dead before she's 30.
The mother of two children, 51 now, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do what others did.
I fell every day, and it took me longer.
I've never been able to skate or skateboard with other kids, and I've been bullied a lot at school because of the way I went and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked into her medical records when her doctor left the room, and it said she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I stuck my nose where I shouldn't have, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and had the worst panic possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my powers in this period.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she had realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and had asked her doctor.
He just got up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
After several genetic tests, she was found to have a CMT.
"When he explained what the CMT was, I thought I pulled out a lucky ticket," she said.
The UK CMT Charitable Organization announced a month of CMT information to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on entrepreneurs in the Washington Zone increases as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies throughout the country increased moderately last year, when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and a company in the Washington Zone is no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia together paid $27.6 billion to the state and local treasury in fiscal year 2013, 3.8 per cent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on business by state and local level increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, from 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after successive years of declining accounts in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young, and the State Tax Center, the tax policy group.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56 per cent, comes from business taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax revenue comes from firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, has the lowest tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues is due to a return to the old value of companies' real estate, researchers say that it raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 per cent.
While large states such as California, New York, and Texas account for a large share of this revenue, the same seems to be happening in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia together paid $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent over the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate does not have any similar effect on the increase in state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one fifth of companies' tax accounts.
Virginia and D.C. companies pay about half of State and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's going on in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around D.C., is owned either by the government or by a non-profit organization that doesn't pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the State Tax Center.
Maryland therefore has to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services as in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be entirely attributed to the re-establishment of the real estate market.
The income of entrepreneurs also seems to be on the right track, according to these data.
Companies in the region declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the largest in the region.
While trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was the same as the national average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth rate in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) at 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, compared with a relatively high rate of 9.975 per cent in the county.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia had lower taxes for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate for business taxes than Maryland.
The county was not assessed in the study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from her neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax targets next year, this law could raise the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to even 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington Zone seem to be feeling better and thus paying more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Business taxes paid by small business owners in the form of an individual income tax - a transition structure that accommodates most small firms - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia - increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business tax revenue across the country is likely to continue this year, with turnover tax revenues in state and local governments increasing by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may be lagging behind, as lower federal spending affects the region’s labour market.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The Judo World Cup won two silver and seven bronze medals for Russia.
By this measure, the Russians have only given way to Japan’s main favorite competition.
The Chelyabinsk tournament began on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
It was owned by Beslan Mudranov, who performed in a category of up to 60 kg.
However, in an equal final battle with Baldbaatar Ganbat of Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation resolved only one observation received by a Russian.
The second day of the tournament was the most successful day for Russia, and three medals were won on Tuesday.
In the men's 66 kg of silver competition, Mikhail Pulyaev and the bronze to Kamal Khan Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian defeated the 2011 and 2013 world champion Masashi Ebinume.
The Khan Magomedov, who lost to his compatriots at the quarter-final stage, won a comforting tournament and won a bronze award.
In the women's 52 kg tournament, Natalia Kusutin also reached the third step of the pedestal.
In the semi-finals, she lost to the current world champion, Mailinda Kelmendi of Kosovo, who played under the flag of the Judo International Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the argument for Kusutin's bronze, she won from Ma Inan of China, but after the tournament, she admitted that third place was not what she expected.
Once again, Kelmendi, who had defeated Kusutina earlier in the European Championships, was a barrier to Russian gold.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Moses put the bronze in the bank of Russia's national team, fighting in a category of up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinal, he was abused by a former Moldovan spokesman, Victor Skovortsov, who now plays for the UAE team.
However, the Russian won two contractions and became the winner of the award.
He competed at the home championship with a holoscope injury, which he plans to heal shortly, so he will pause in the competition.
As for the ex-moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal at the tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, who had taken UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, with bronze, had completed his performance in a category of up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the FM-2014 also brought the Russians one bronze, which Ivan Nifont won in a category of up to 81 kg.
In a heavy battle of the small finals, he defeated Frenchman Alan Schmitt with a comment from his opponent.
On Friday, three sets of awards were held, but the Russians traditionally confined themselves to one bronze in a men's tournament up to 90 kg.
It was owned by Kirill Quesov, and the medal was guaranteed to Russia: his competitor in the comforting final was Kirill Denisov's compatriots.
However, the contraction itself did not take place: the rival, Qovova, was unable to get out of the tatami because of the injury.
The men's bronze was won by the owners, and on the sixth day of the competition, Renat Saidov, who was in the 100 kg category, was put into the pool.
In the comforting finale, he won a clear victory over Brazilian David Moura.
So ended the individual part of the world's first.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Sunday, the world's team champions were held.
Both Russian teams, male and female, were among the main applicants for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, the women of the beautiful sex were not lucky enough to get to the medal.
But Russian judoists won the team's silver.
In a decisive stand-off, they gave way to Japan’s main favorite competition team in the hard fight against the score of 2-3.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after the net victory of Khan Magomedov and the volleyman Denis Jartsev (weighting up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories, Murat Habachirov (81), Mohammed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope with their Japanese rivals.
In the same scenario, the bronze match developed in a women's tournament, where the Russian team lost 2–0 to the Japanese.
Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, attended the team competition in Chelyabinsk, where he congratulated the men's team with silver after the tournament.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could have become champions," said Putin, whose words RIA quotes "News."
To lose to the Japanese, to the Judo family leaders, there's nothing wrong with it.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
Russia's team at the World Cup was much better than a year ago at a competition of this level in Rio de Janeiro.
At the time, the Russian team only had three medals - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev missed the present tournament.
We're all, of course, big maximalists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is one of the eight strongest, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in a sport such as Judo, Russian Minister of Sport Vitaly Mutko summarized the tournament, which was quoted by the press service of the championship.
Japan's team is expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various merits, five of which proved to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family is hoping for the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she arrived at the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed her hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from her illness.
"Thanks for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in her statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an urgent call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoskopi, reports from sources.
Doctors deliberately keep her under absconded and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “heavy”.
The response was wide-ranging, including extensive Internet support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Rip.
Everyone can be kings.
The band's debut album, "Royal Blood", is a new hope for the British rock, which led the rock duets out of the clubs directly to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo has been onstage for a year, but has already been active for the BBC Music Award, the Arctic Monkeys opening tour, and a visit to the New York concert dressing room from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album, the same name, had received 100,000 pre-releases a few months before its release, and the contract for its release was in Warner Music's portfolio.
Given the current unfortunate situation in the music market, the situation is out of line, not the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-haired representative of the new R'n'B, but the duo of the bullish-looking British, playing with the volume and intensity that was last fashioned a few decades ago.
In general, the stakes for the first album were particularly high in all the above-mentioned circumstances and have already been met.
The duo had taken a name for himself that could have been attacked before, except for a very desperate hairy metal player, and the blood of which kings seemed to be leaking in their veins, too, understood.
It is, of course, a question of past Led Zeppelin heroes: like the great quartet, Royal Blood is designed to shake the stagnant blood of the British rock to a new height.
It may be too early to predict the success of this enterprise, but something can be said.
A dozen songs in thirty minutes are not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composer's gift as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of the individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let's say the pilot single "Out of the Black" is characterised by what is remembered not by the melody line, but by the drum.
Musicians are jokingly saying that this song is easier to knock than it is to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing song "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
The truth, however, is that each of these songs will sound great at a party of heavy rock lovers, but when played in a row, they merge into a more or less homogeneous painting.
And that's not necessarily a bad thing, even the opposite.
The power of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the glory of the new Lennon and McCartney (sometimes marked as Motörhead's successors), but they have removed numerous rock duo members from the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, is made for stadiums, in a room of less than a couple thousand people, it's obvious that it's cramped.
The secret is, in part, the clever use of bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format invented at the beginning of The White Stripes.
But it's not just about the tools, it's about the way the songs are written.
The heroes of the zero retrorocke were struggling to move beyond the post-modern paradigm, with great reluctance to recognize themselves not just as epigons, but as independent creative units.
The Royal Blood is already sounding so powerful and brazen that it successfully drapes some of the resonance and hardness of the music material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twich for $1.04 billion.
AMAZON just confirmed what Information said on Friday morning: Online store - and video producer - and hundreds of other things - buys a $1.04 billion Twitch video streaming service (US$970 million).
This news was not a surprise because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a general flow service -- a YouTube version in real time.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their intra-game moments; "YouTube for real-time games", according to Business Insider.
Twitch's interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which all-Knowers give (mostly old) game processing, like in The Secret Theatre, are already popular on YouTube.
The point is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of a well-established technology company buying out a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly as willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Twich Executive Director Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is Twich's incredible success.
Snobs like me, who say they're better at sports than watching them, it's hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of taking a joystick in their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m., when it crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a stranger get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling their own perspective can be a recipe for headaches worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the rapid passages where Rogers Banisters of our e-century finish whole games in record time are entertaining.
But if it's not about game virtuoso or humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and this is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon work on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twich would collide in Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could just swallow Twich.
But Twitch has something that any company would love to have: the crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twich Shir, Amazon and Twich said, "both believe in the future of games," and this channel does not show signs of wilting, even - ow - as a spectacular sport.
The 2004 terrorist attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to the survivors - almost all of the students now - with the parents of the victims, with the graveyard overseer Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the Matheres Beslan committee of Susana Dudieva, who participated in the special operation of the MES, says Elizabeth Antonov, a social worker working on a special project.
Having already returned to Moscow, he met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was the President's adviser to the North Caucasus and held talks with terrorists, as well as with FSB officer V of Russia, Viacheslav Bocharov.
What really shocked me about the time I worked on this topic is that it's like Beslan hasn't been here in ten years.
It's a very painful subject for anyone who has anything to do with it, and people have trouble talking about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very difficult.
But Beslan cannot be forgotten, and I hope we've done our job,” Antonova said.
A special project has been developed by Rambler & Co.'s infographic studio, which has been working with the company since spring.
Previous special projects were devoted to World War I and to Vladimir Putin's 15th anniversary in power.
Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea launched a short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the Japanese Sea, reports Renhap.
The launch took place around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando Province, on the North Korean-China border.
It is believed that the missile landed in the Sea of Japan, flying some 220 kilometres, and declared in the Joint Committee of South Korean Chiefs of Staff.
The deputies suggested that the Personal Data Act should be expedited.
If the initiative is successful, Russians will not be able to store data on servers abroad as of 1 January 2015
A draft law has been introduced in the State Duma to extend the date of entry into force of the already adopted Russian Personal Data Act from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is part of the legislative framework of the lower house.
The authors were members of the State Duma, Vadim Mán, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov (Uniform Russia), Vladimir Parahin (Justified Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
This change, in the view of the proponents, will help to ensure faster and more effective protection of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the preservation of personal data and the privacy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The Act, whose entry into force is rushed by parliamentarians, requires Russians to keep their personal data on the territory of the Russian Federation processed through the Internet.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, accumulate, store, refine and extract personal data from citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located in the Russian Federation, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of Russian personal data legislation by a court decision.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called “blacklists” of offending websites, an automated information system called the “Register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects”.
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The draft was sponsored by Andrei Lugova and Vadim Malone of LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of CRCF.
Mán and Yushchenko are also among the sponsors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who don't have data centers in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent.
Commenting on the bill introduced today in the State Duma, Leonid Levine stated that he saw no problem in moving the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that by 1 January 2015 would not have their own Russian personal data repositories on the territory of the Russian Federation would be able to rent them, for example, from “Rostelcom”, which has repeatedly said that they are willing to rent their servers and are already providing their servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies that are now providing their servers.”
“In addition, there are several independent data centres willing to cooperate in this field”, he added.
“If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problem – they will have technological accommodation,” Levin summarized.
Disputed Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association feared that if the draft law were adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
These include online booking services for airlines and hotels.
According to the association, “the draft law deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation - of the right to dispose of their own data by making it imperative that their recording, systematization, etc., should be provided only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of where the recording takes place and to systematize its personal data.
In such a case, it would be up to the individual to decide on the territory in which the acts would be carried out.
The adoption of similar bills on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the abandonment of global services and significant economic losses.
Ice water bucket test participant dislocated jaw
Isabel Roberts of the United Kingdom screamed so hard when ice water was poured on her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This trial by the bucket of ice water has gone wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so hard during the ice-water test that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabel Roberts screamed so fiercely when ice water was poured on her head to damage her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did, my jaw got stuck," she said.
They pour water on a 20-year-old.
Isabel Roberts, seconds before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but it didn't close, it was stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister got the same understanding and started laughing, but I had to get to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to a hospital to correct her jaw after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The video became an online sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militia handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The Army of Novorossia claims that Ukrainian Su-27 was shot down and accuses the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement.
As of 10 a.m. on 1 September, the militia had handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by a spokesperson for the Novorssia Army.
He added that “by anti-aircraft forces in the Mereška area, a Su-27 aircraft that violated ceasefire arrangements was shot down”.
According to an agency interviewee, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions in the shelling of Lugan airport.
The spokesperson noted that the militia had managed to damage two Ukrainian Air Force helicopters at a field airfield during the night, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"The enemy's casualties, up to 100 people killed and wounded, surrendered 13 people," summarized by the staff representative.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the “people's republics” Donbass announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side, within the framework of the ceasefire regime, of 223 captured soldiers and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, during the night, the DNR Army, according to the Novorssia Army, “prevented an attempt by the National Guards to remove heavy equipment from the surrounding area in violation of previous agreements”.
At that time, the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in a short battle, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total casualties of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) during that night amounted to five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, and more than 120 people were killed and injured.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers were surrounded by militia in the Iloweisk region of Donetsk province.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leaders of the “people's republics” to release Ukrainian soldiers from their surroundings.
In the DNR, they agreed to do so subject to the surrender of arms and ammunition by the enemy.
The first dozens of soldiers began leaving the surrounding localities on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion Donbass Semen Semenchenko, 14 others left the kotla on Sunday night.
On his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded were “in captivity from 137 regiments of 32 divisions of the Russian Federation and 9 tank brigades of the Russian Federation”, where they were treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of Russia denied reports by Ukrainian military and NATO of the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Russia will respond to new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take remedial measures to protect its legitimate interests in the event of the imposition of new anti-Russian sanctions, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A communication from the Russian Foreign Diplomatic Authority states that the European Council's 30 August “conclusions” demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their unseemly support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine on the basis of “absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country” said on the website of the agency.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member States, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as for the conditions for a full-fledged “dialogue between the warring parties”, stresses the agency.
The agency's website also notes that there is no objective assessment of the humanitarian situation in Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has occurred, nor is there a growing number of civilian casualties.
It will be recalled that within the next seven-day period in the European Union it is planned to develop concrete proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
In doing so, EU representatives work closely with United States officials.
They are expected to correlate between the measures introduced over the period of validity and the degree of stringency.
New EU sanctions may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an expansion of sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and oil and gas.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who is about to graduate, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of renting books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My math analysis textbook, which usually costs $180, got me a $10 semester and a "Chick-fil-A" cookie, says Schroeder, 19 years old, who's at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The needed literature last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and teaching supplies, but students have a range of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet stores and creative ideas like Schroeder's system.
Book rental is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book for a semester, and is often much cheaper than buying it.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that book sales have doubled since 2011.
Industry studies show that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during last spring's semester, says Vice President Trevor Meyer of Nibo.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookshops, according to the professional association “National Association of University Stores”.
Here's an introduction to the best way to make a good deal.
Buying from an Internet store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler is worth about $290 per price list, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of used equipment
If you don't mind other people's marks or injuries, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical analysis" is sold for $93.49 on loan at Chegg.com.
Matt Cassadey, 25, fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of "Strategic Decisions in Media: Understanding the Business of Advertising."
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracey, director of College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invite students to check with their professors whether previous editions can be used.
Sometimes updates are not significant for classes.
In such cases, old publications are often found at a very small percentage of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Rent
You might want to think about renting textbooks, if you treat them well enough, you won't forget to return them, and you won't want to keep them after the course's over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of the new book.
For example, one student was able to rent "Mathematical Analysis" for about $20 a semester.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you may be fined for marking, underlining, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember, if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of the new copy.
Electronic books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented by acquiring an electronic licence for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg.com's six-month rental of Mathematical Analysis will cost approximately $61.
Bracie says that students studying literature can often find the most advantageous prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, while literature in natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look around.
Joe Galt, 29 years old, who is about to start at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to determine book prices, as this ensures that you are looking for the exact text you need.
Before you order online, Golt says, make sure that the book is in the warehouse.
He had a hard time getting that lesson.
The delivery of the book he bought was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin has declared the Far East Development Fund to be completely ineffective.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the governance of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the Far East Development Budget Investment Fund, established two years ago, is ineffective, reports Interfax.
“15 billion rubles remained on deposits,” the President stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State instructed that the approval of the list of advanced territories in the Far East should be expedited.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of the thor must be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, as noted by the President, had not approved the list and criteria of the advance territories in the Far East before 1 July.
Vladimir Putin has also formulated basic objectives for the development of the Far East.
These include improving the region ' s transport accessibility and removing infrastructure restrictions, both in the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create preconditions for attracting additional investment to the region, as well as to create areas of forward development that should become competitive with the key ATP business centres, as emphasized by the President.
As will be recalled, it has been previously reported that a forward-looking territory can replace an EPZ.
Why the Galactic Guards couldn't save the cashier's fees.
Sylvester Stallone was given less than $30 million back from his $90 million budget in the United States, while "The City of Sin: A Woman Worth Killing" returned only $12 million from its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's Home Video brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's movies like "How to tame Dragon 2" are also disappointed by the profits.
The Telegraph article by Robbie Colleen indicates that when it comes to children’s films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colleen called 2014 the worst year in the history of children's films and called "How to tame Dragon 2" a barely "operational" continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films directed at a slightly older audience, it does not seem that the problem is necessarily one of films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film that was released in summer with at least 2,000 copies between May and 20 July, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both viewers and critics, suggest that this year's film harvest is similar in size to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that it can be about changing visual habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services such as Netflix.
Directed by John Favro, who is currently working on the soon-to-be-received Disney film "The Book of the Jungle" said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase what happened before.
Unlike the current drop in cash collection in Hollywood, Netflix's income from the streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic strip franchises, and predicted Hollywood's "red".
In the light of the current recession, some commentators argue that there was a share of truth in his dark predictions.
As several potential cash hits are expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: the Altron Era, the Minions and the Jura Park, others are more optimistic about the film industry.
Producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in cashier's fees just "cyclical," saying Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the most cashier summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants in European and Japanese food, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, the general public has so far preferred to replace prohibited imports with products from Latin America, Israel, and China, not from Russia.
"There's a little pickle better than a bad mozzarella," laments the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of the cheeses that the suppliers offer him instead of the Italians.
Mozzarella and burrat cheese ran out of at the restaurant first, with a short shelf life.
The parmesan should be available for a few more months.
What do we do?
Switch to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Road Market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear that shocking memories do not release him until now.
The meat there was only 30 centimeters from the floor on the carts!
There's cats in there!
Rats!
That's when I said we'd never buy anything in Russian markets for our restaurant.
I don't know, maybe it's changed now.
But the other day, I got a sample of fish from the Far East.
That's how it turned out to be dead!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought this to us.
Valerio is surprised that many of Italy’s usual things are for a Russian manufacturer to be wild.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in a refrigeration room for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang out to be soft, so the muscles can relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get that tender meat?"
I told you, it's yours, Russians!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
Five minutes from Barlotti at the French restaurant Brasserie Bridge in the kitchen, there's a stop list showing missing products: French oysters, sea hedgehogs.
The chef of the Brasserie Bridge restaurant and the Stroke bar, Régis Trigel, is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the oysters from France have already replaced the oysters from Tunisia and the French cheeses will replace the restaurant with Swiss cheeses.
However, Régis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Fluttle cabbage - 200 rubles!
I said, "Why is it worth so much?"
They say to me, "Well, we have to make some money, too."
But this cabbage shouldn't cost more than 80 rubles!
Far east oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15 to 20 years, you know how much their shell weighs?
At the price, it's super-delicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of fear for foreign cooks.
Standard story: "For the first three months, everything was good, then quality plummeted."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable caliber and quality.
A lot of restaurants in the European kitchen don't know what's gonna happen when they run out of cheese.

On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russia’s security, mostly called product sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and co-products from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrup.
Restaurants have begun to have a Chekhard with suppliers: food prices have risen, and there is an urgent need to look for analogues from other countries.
This will have the greatest impact on expensive restaurants with monocookies from France, Italy, Spain, to which products were delivered directly from “mother” countries.
The community has had to rebuild before.
For example, when in early 2014, Rosselhoszor banned the importation of Australian beef, and one year earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In exchange, suppliers have procured beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But summer-2014 sanctions have proved to be much more severe.
However, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban the children of Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose milk, seed potatoes, sugar maize, peas and onions for planting.
Valerio, an Italian, hopes that the sanctions may be eased further.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist under conditions of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, imports accounted for up to 70 per cent of the premium segment.
"Dear restaurants will have to change their menus to what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergei Mironov, the restaurant owner of RestConsult.
If the chef's strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few cooks like this, and it could take two to three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the Brasserie Bridge is ready for this: 10-15% of the food will have to be refused, and half the menu will have to be reworked.
In mixed kitchen restaurants, foods, such as marble beef steak, are already being replaced by befstrogans, says Sergei Mironov.
"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, by Oxana Glibchuk, a representative of East-West.
Cream and dairy products from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the United States can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and semga from Norway - salmon, semga, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of European vegetables and fruit can be compensated by domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, it would be easier for the network’s budget restaurants to rebuild than the bonus segment: it was unlikely that gourmets would go there to distinguish between Italian mozzarella and Russian.
Although Ginza Project will be difficult, he thinks.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with its menu.
"It'll take a lot of time to replace," said Mironov.
Ginza refused comments, citing the lack of owners in the country.
Café owners of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from former Soviet republics are more fragrant than Europeans.
But there's a lot of restaurants that won't be targeted.
These include the kitchens of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive foods in Georgian kitchen," says Khatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe "Wai Me!"
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, and we don't use exotic greens at the base of many foods.
No meals have been removed from the menu at Kolbai establishments.
Timur of Lansky, the owner of Chaihon N1 restaurants with Uzbek cuisine, is also comfortable with sanctions: he will only have to change lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia gets imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, we'll even win the price, it'll be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
From the CIS, it is cheaper to get clippings, lambs, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.
But what comes from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain, and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes that they're delicious, sweet.
No one says that about Spanish.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Olimba Artykov, stated that he planned to double the export of horticultural products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan indicated their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
The fast food restaurant that responded to the money request is also quite calmly responding to the sanctions.
McDonald's press service stated that localization was over 85% and the network was working with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of Subway Russia's supplier department, about 80 per cent of products are purchased by the network in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties in the supply of vegetables and increases in the prices of meat products produced from imported raw materials.
No more than 4 per cent of “sanctioned products” were occupied in “Tremka”.
They didn't touch the sanctions, nor did they touch the Vocker noodles.
KFC, Burger King, and Little Potato didn't respond to a query by Money, but other market participants argue that Burger King's localization is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are prepared to buy more Chilean than Russian far east.
On your hunchback.
In the meantime, restaurants complain that even local food prices are rising due to increased demand.
"Grabley's food prices rose by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Cherri Mio" doubled,” says the rector Roman Rozhnikovski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will grow by 5 to 10%, and Kolbay admits.
East-West does not deny this: “For example, Belarusian dairy products have been at a cost of 10-15 per cent since the beginning of August.”
"Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork," complains Sergei Ruck, Deputy Director General of Stardogs.
Chicken hams cost 35%.
Waiting for prices from China, maybe they'll cool off the hot Brazilian heads.
Stardogs will soon have a planned price increase of 8%.
It's too bad to raise prices now, says Cancer.
According to statistics, the increase in income for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how fast: while most of the bakers have stocked up their products for the next two months, hoping to wait for price swings.
But what happens in two months, nobody knows.
In front of Moscow City Hall, there are a dozen tents decorated with green and wood.
At the center of the stage, musicians play waltz.
It's a regional food festival called "There's Time."
"We've been planning on having a local food festival for a long time, and here's the sanctions, we've rushed in, we've organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
Behind the scene with the musicians, the Greek chef Anastas is making pasta salad and homemade candy, and the other day there was a master class in the preparation of a boron with caramelized apples.
All Russian foods, the organizers assure us.
In the tents is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, deer from Salehard, vegetables from Lenin's Sovhoza, cheese from an Italian man, Jay Clouse.
"The salmon for restaurants can be safely replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East," says the owner of the fish shop, "The Men" by Philip Galkin.
We've got Nerves, ketahs, kizhuchas, humpbacks, teasing - "Royal salmon."
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You pick him up, he doesn't even move.
And you can't hold our far-east salmon hands.
Only establishments without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic ones.
In the window of his tent are shrimps with Magadan tags, cods, omules, floursun, mussels from Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin is sure it's long overdue to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 were more than 4 million tons, and a large proportion of fish went to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
My people's shop's been working since 2012, selling fish through an Internet store, serving a dozen and a half restaurants before the sanctions, such as Simple Things.
A further 15 restaurants have now approached Galkin.
You can make the same sushi out of our fish, it's hot.
We've got a lot going on, we've tried all sorts of recipes.
We're selling sushi through an Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish are several times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In support of Galkin's tent, I'm getting a philadelphia with a ket.
Unlike the race rolls, they have to chew longer, but the realization that this fish, our native fish, is a force.
There's even halibut rolls and sea bass on the website of "The Men of Ours."
In sushi bars, however, they prefer to replace Norwegian salmon with Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains that cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes with far-east fish.
"The Russian fish has not yet been offered to us by suppliers," explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitri Evesev.
The situation is similar to that of other products: Russian producers could have occupied an liberated niche, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimov, it is now more likely that imports from Europe and America will be replaced by imports from China, Israel, and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace prohibited imports, unlike our farmers.
That is to say, the major producers of other countries will benefit first and foremost from the ban,” Akimov says.
In the past month, however, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than the food sanctions.
As a result of massive unannounced inspections by Rospornadzor, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are studying the nature of the claims made to determine the actions required to open restaurants to visitors as soon as possible,” said Money to McDonald's Press Service.
No one really knows what's going to happen.
If all is limited to product sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says, anonymously, an employee of a restaurant consulting company.
If they close McDonald's all over the country, the script will be quite different.
Europrotocol instead of GBDD
Casco payments will be available without HBDD's background - so the CD intends to stimulate the introduction of Europrotocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed draft guidelines according to which, as of 1 September this year, the insured motorist will be able to do without the GBDS certificate to receive the Casco payments.
The only cases in question were those where the accident had been performed on the Europrotocol without the involvement of the traffic police.
That is, if only two vehicles were involved in the accident, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the established limit, and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
As of 2 August, the Europrotocol payment limit is 50,000 roubles, and as of 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Moscow and Leningrad oblasts it will be raised to 400,000 roubles.
The point is that often even with minor injuries, in a situation where an accident can be handled by Europrotocol, drivers who have been involved in an accident call a DPT.
After all, in the case of the Casco policy, it was not possible to obtain compensation for it without the HDRO ' s certificate.
The parameters set out in the draft guideline are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum Casco payment for non-HYDDS employees should not be lower than the Europrotocol limit.
However, it cannot exceed the limit set by the Casco insurance policy.
Of course, the idea is useful and theoretically able to unload both the ADP staff and the roads.
But it is likely that neither motorists nor insurers will be thrilled with it.
The latter are already talking about the serious threat of an increase in fraud that could result from the introduction of new rules for the payment of Kascos.
As far as drivers are concerned, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome Russia’s ancient conservatism.
The driver will, in most cases, wait hours for the inspector to make a minor accident, because it's more reliable.
And it's not yet known that it's easier to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the Europrotocol.
A savings certificate will make it nameless and irrevocable.
D.O.F. wants to ban bearer savings certificates, but lets banks make them the equivalent of an irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban bearer savings certificates.
This tool has recently gained popularity, as the stakes here are higher than those on bank deposits.
The fact is that bearer savings certificates are not covered by deposit insurance and are cheaper for the bank, as there is no need to contribute to the Deposit Insurance Agency.
The sharpness of the situation is that this step is planned because of the small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and will be affected by it, Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which are estimated by ACV to control 98 per cent of the relevant market.
The Bank of Moscow is estimated by the Agency to account for about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained by the AAC, is that the customers of a small bank that bought such a certificate, if his licence is withdrawn, try to obtain money from the AAC.
Some depositors, lacking financial literacy and buying bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.
The well-founded lack of insurance payments for these certificates, if the bank ' s licence is revoked, could lead to misunderstanding and social tensions.
In the agency's practice, there have been cases in which bearers of bearer certificates have sought to recover insurance compensation through a court of law”, stated the AAC.
The problem is, of course, bogus.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of certificates, since they have no legal right to compensation from the State.
Had it been that the instrument was not insured by the ASA, it would have been banned from the metal accounts in which the funds of the citizens were recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts are not included in the deposit insurance system either, but their existence has not yet been attempted.
It is likely that bearer certificates are a very convenient security that can actually act as a quasi-dengue.
However, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any client of a bank can buy a certificate, hand it over to any citizen, and before cashing it can be replaced by many owners.
It is not by accident that the bill stipulates that a savings certificate must necessarily be the name of the security that must be kept in the depositary.
And in order to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the possibility of early repayment.
That is to say, the equivalent of an irrevocable contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nyport and Cardiff
The weekend saw protests by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclau followed developments for us over the weekend and spoke to protesters from everywhere, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter Islamic State terrorist groups, ITAR-TASS reports on 31 August, referring to a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the Government of Germany led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to be sending to Iraq 30 Milan portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The deliveries will take place before the end of September.
In addition, it has been decided to allocate an additional 50 million euros for humanitarian assistance to Iraq.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will deliver a government statement on the subject in the Bundestag.
So far, Germany has not delivered its weapons to the hot spots.
The views of the people of the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the sending of weapons to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop fighters from the Islamic State, while others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militias hit by a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donetsk militia shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TASS.
It is reported that this occurred in the Gulf of Taganrog, near the towns of Shirokino and Unname (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media outlets report shooting at two coast guard boats.
It is explained that the incident took place today around 16:20 msk.
Teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two buchoker teenagers were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy went camping shortly after noon on Sunday at Govetts Lip in Blackhit.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search party, comprising local police and a rescue team, was dispatched and a couple were found around 11 p.m. near Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and hurt his head.
Officers stayed with a couple overnight, and they were picked up at the winch on Monday morning.
They were taken in an ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two Unions Meeting
The high-level talks in Minsk did not resolve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first members of the European Union met with the first persons of the future of Eurasian Europe.
For the first time, the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed a number of “hot issues” on an alarming occasion (the situation around Ukraine is urgent).
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is not clear; it is clear who took the cream off this summit.
Questions in this regard disappeared on the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, followed by other Eurasians and Europeans, saw the news of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader set an example of fine courtesy, that was the behaviour of a man who had just ripped off a jackpot - and planned a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maydan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European Commissioners (EU Ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf - not just the legitimization of the President with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full subject of European politics and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Denis Melyantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met the Tet-a-tet with Lukashenko suggests that relations with the EU will continue to defrost," he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparations for a breakthrough long before the November Maydan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
“The results have been achieved and with the EU are successful negotiations on visa and readmission facilitation, modernization dialogues,” lists an interlocutor, Ognja, and talks have been held with the US on international security.
The States even lifted a few sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves, and the reaction of the leaders of Belarus to them, have only boosted the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain its relations with Ukraine, warm enough not to lose much of its trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure rejected Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militia in Donbas with all severity, did not argue with Moscow.
Minsk has not withdrawn from the Customs Union or CSTO, and the Baranovics have a Russian airbase.
Brussels and Washington have noticed and appreciated Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue, and Belarus's experts are confident.
The success of Lukashenko’s political diversification will be seen in how often in the near future Minsk will be able to host EU+TC meetings.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expected of relations in the new format.
Spokesperson Ashton Maya Kosiančič merely stated that, against the background of war and peace, the topic was not a priority.
It was reported that Kazakhstan could also be the next venue for a meeting on the Ukrainian question with the first persons in a new format.
A drop of detour for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he had been personally asked to do so by the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties were not opposed to Minsk remaining the central meeting place, both in Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of the heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” is becoming a fully hands-on European leader who helps solve the global problem.
Best friend of a European farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the Euro-Commissaries on Trade and Energy, led to the conclusion that the main rationale for the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbas, but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future negotiations on gas supplies and to overcome the concerns of TC countries under Ukraine’s association agreement with the EU, which had been brought to a close at the meeting, appeared to be more ambitious than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Commissioner for Trade, Carl De Gucht, nevertheless stated: EU representatives “came to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis, which has economic consequences, not the other way around”.
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine will also work for Belarus.
Its consequences - and above all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still experiencing sanctions pressure, a long-awaited manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Mises Research Centre, ex-candidate of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are keenly interested in Belarus's ability to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation without sanctions.
In doing so, supply chains are being put in place, for which Vladimir Putin burned Minsk at the summit.
"The initiators of these schemes," said Romanchuk "Ognyku," are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have been working on supply chains for a long time, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have now been destroyed.
Russian business urgently needs to rebuild them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second, an expert, relates to the fact that many Ukrainian companies would like to produce Ukrainian raw materials in Belarus, also targeting the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about 4 billion dollars of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be in demand.”
According to Romanchuk, the role of host of the EU negotiating platform and TC is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic ties with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions were estimated at Euro5-10 billion, while the European Commission currently offered only Euro125 million in compensation to the farmers.
The Belarusian president can ask Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for the Euro farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko’s credibility in the EU to unprecedented heights.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for their initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk, with its active role in the birth of the TC+EU format, is being scrapped, and the Belarusian leader, in a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague, stressed that Kiev was the initiator of the new format.
“It was your proposal to gather, without any doubt, to discuss, not from the bay, to decide, after the signing of the Treaty of Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that was developing in Ukraine at the time,” he appealed to Petr Poroshenko in front of the cameras.
However, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which was said to be initially against Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
Belarus's diplomatic department has been careful to stress that Belarus, in organizing EU-TC cooperation on its land, does not pursue selfish goals, but that the ultimate goal of such a format is to create a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“It is in the spirit of concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the security sphere, the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation, has promoted and advanced,” said the “Fire” in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, an agency where words have recently been carefully chosen.
In Moscow, there may be areas with a fee-paying entry
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of fee-for-entry zones as a method of combating congestion in central roads similar to other major cities in the world, transmitting M24.ru, with reference to Moscow's deputy for transport, Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that has proved successful is a fee-paying entry.
It's an expert opinion, we'll definitely study it, look at all the pros and cons.
To say that there are some decisions on this matter that are still too early," Lixutov said.
The Deputy Mayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which were similar in structure and workload to Moscow, was very important to the capital’s authorities.
One of the solutions taken from these countries is the central ring road already under construction, added Lixutov.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Highway is an example of something that doesn't have to pass all the traffic through Moscow.
If there were sufficient bypass infrastructure, there would be no need for transit traffic in Moscow,” the deputy mayor pointed out.
Also, Maxim Lixutov stated that the introduction of fee-paying parking spaces had significantly unloaded the streets of the capital.
And according to him, the capital authorities are not planning to stop at what has been achieved.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, participated in a ceremony to mark the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).
It's boring.
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, "City of Sins-2: A Woman Worth Killing" did not make the same revolution that could have been expected of him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), filmed with the minimal but symbolic involvement of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary Nuar.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way, in the sense that it destroys the fundamental modern thinking chain of "thesis-antithesis-fusion" (in terms of the Nuar universe and antithesis-comics space).
From now on, it should read "thesis - antithesis - chaos."
The "City of Sins-2" is chaotic at both the dramatic and philosophical levels: both times it is chaotic in the wrong sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes know each other from the first City, although, here, the giant Marv, I remember, ended his life in an electric chair, and here, nothing but a long time to steal, as this folk friend, from the air of knives and other axes with the hooks.
But old people are literally being pushed around with their elbows by newcomers, as if they had broken into the city from some other movie, the meaning and story of which the audience is being asked not to worry.
So, there's a story that's shamelessly torn apart by the authors at the most interesting place, by super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Myself is with a lustful, frigid Eva Lord (Ewa Green) and for something vindictive to her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this mix-up in which Dwight, let's say, can't tell Johnny's face, especially since faces, like other parts of the body, are being torn apart by regularity, not even half-problem.
They're not humans, we know they're noir archetypes: a rocky bitch, a self-confident player who's fallen into a honey trap of sex, a corrupt gimp.
Well, when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and an archetype, it's no longer a movie, but it's an abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is ridiculous.
Besides, even in this troubled world, there is something permanent.
War whores from the first City continue to hold a circular defense against the forces of darkness ensnaring their home slums.
And Detective Hartigan's ghost doesn't, and he's gonna look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem with "City of Sins-2" is another.
Frank Miller was good at putting together a comic book and a noir as a painter, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to put comic books on screen.
Comic and Noir are two aggressively opposed "realities."
==History==The comic book phenomenon was born in the late 1920s, at the same time that Dashil Hammet's novels "Blood Harvest" (1929), "Maltic Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of Noire, then known as the hard-boiled school.
Or pulp fiction.
The comics have given Hollywood dozens of heroes, from Popay's sailor, the spinach eater who gives him rich power, Superman, Batman, and Dick Tracy's scout to the Hulk, the Torah, Spider-Man and other vigilantes.
But in any movie, there was something wrong with the comics: the drawing characters persisted in not wanting to grow on screen flesh, remained pretenders in the surrounding will-not-so-real world.
Simply put, they were completely disenfranchised.
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After world wars, the traditional novel - with its experiences, character, family scandals and historical background - has lost all credibility.
What foresites, what Tibo and Rugon-Makkar, what even Bolkon and Rostov think after Vesten, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into a soap opera, and the criminal - by definition marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammet learned on his own skin what it's like to be a nurse on the front line.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Lowsey, Edward Dmitric.
So the Noir, whose archetype they set, is first, crude and cynical, and second, purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically connected the comic to the Noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book was alive, not shy of its graphic nature, but pretended to be a "real" film.
The lot of the corrupt world where the cardinal ordered the murders and the senator covered for the terrible sadist son was worthy of Hammet's pen.
And the scenic details, such as the severed heads that the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the brilliant James Ellroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best, i.e. the declaratory nauseating Neonuar.
"City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a surrender of Miller's radical style--Rodriges to the comic book tradition.
It must have happened a lot because of 3D technologies.
When you watch the second "City of Sins," you feel like you're in a glass ball where the snow falls on a toy clown.
Most of the time, though, it's not snow, it's blood clots, but what's the big difference?
Well, there's nothing to say about socialism.
I mean, it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere, sometimes, even on the side of a dirty swamp, but there's a normal world where you can bring back a girl who's gone down a crooked path or, say, tell a sad parent that her ruiner is punished.
But when there is no sin in the city except sin, it is no sin, but a norm.
Boring like any rule.
The Chaos of Sin City 2 is boring.
For the sake of justice, the local rent has given this bland sin a small but perp.
The literature warns that the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In a vegetarian episode where a man's fingers are pinched, it gives him hell's humor.
Hammet would love it.
French socialists should shut up and get France in order, says the key ally of Frasua Holland.
Mr. Vall called on the deeply divided left-wing forces to “show a warm attitude” to the attacked Socialist President, whose reshuffles were not approved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, applauding.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured that his Government would not question the disputed 35-hour working week in France, despite the proposals that fuel the conflict, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain “unified” with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the Minister of Justice, put sticks in the wheels by coming to a meeting of dissenting Socialist Party members of Parliament and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French “to lose faith in the future”.
Marín le Pé, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not realize that the new Wall Government would last more than a few months.
François Hollande is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Valle, forced to assemble a new government when the summer never passed.
"And the new one won't last autumn or winter either," said Mrs. Le Pen to the reporters.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
The ruling French party survived the defeat in the March municipal elections, and the extreme right-wing National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey of Sunday's Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party risks falling into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Holland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Cians Poe, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"City without drugs" left no suit.
The Sverdlovsk Court of Arbitration dismissed the claim of the Managing Directorate of the Regional Ministry for the Management of Public Property to the “City Free of Drugs” Foundation.
The agency intended to collect more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rent for a building in the centre of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the Court of Arbitration of Sverdlovsk province dismissed the action of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Region (MIGSO) against the “City without Drugs” Foundation (one of the founders, the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Royzman).
The regional authorities intended to collect 7.3 million roubles from the organization as rent for the building.
Today, it became known that the plaintiff had twice failed to appear before the court, which led to the decision not to proceed.
The reason for the absence was not explained by the representatives at the MIGIZO Directorate, and Maxim Titov, the head of the legal department, did not respond to the telephone calls.
Representatives of the Foundation were also not contacted.
This is the mansion that occupied the foundation in the centre of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 free of charge since 2011.
This decision was made by the ex-Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of Sverdlovsk province filed an action with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court for the removal of the foundation from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the agency had requested that the contract of free use of the memorial house be declared unincorporated through a court of law.
In the opinion of the Directorate, the agreement did not contain significant terms and conditions for the lease of a cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk arbitral tribunal dismissed the claim, at which time an appeal was filed with the 17th Permi arbitral tribunal, which was granted.
The fund then filed a cassation appeal against the decision with the same court, which was rejected and appealed by the fund to the High Court of Arbitration, but the court took the side of the board.
In 2013, a new lease was concluded under which the fund began to pay rent again, as reported by the head of the city of Evgeny Royzeman.
The rent was set at 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for free, recognizing our achievements in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the foundation.
The current administration decided otherwise," he said.
Tatiana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, Ekaterinburg’s deputy, the unicross, Alexander Kosintsev, asked the city’s mayor, the speaker of the proud Evgeny Royzman, to resign.
The reason was a criminal case against a retired woman, Oleg Kinev, who was arrested on suspicion of murdering a retired woman, who was considered to be an associate of the mayor.
How Eugenia Royzeman was found in a criminal case
On 1 July, it was reported that criminal proceedings had been initiated in connection with the offence of “culpability” (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code) on the blog of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Royzman.
This was reported to the Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Sverdlovsk province, where Anna Filatov, Director-General of the Legal Centre for the Defence, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Royzeman accused her of having been involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband on his blog.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
The iPhone will be turned into a wallet.
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is due to introduce its new designs, new leaks are appearing in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
According to American media sources, the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of the joint Apple project and the payment systems of Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and Re/code's dedicated Internet resource, Apple may also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express at the 9 September launch of new products, making the mobile wallet function available in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse any comment on this matter.
This function allows payment to be made on the store counter using a smartphone.
The user will identify the payment using his thumbprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will for the first time incorporate NFC (near filed communication) technology, which allows uncontacted payments to be made using a smartphone and an appropriate reader on the cash register.
NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced in 2004 as a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum, an association for the promotion of this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with the NFC function of Samsung Nexus S was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced Google Wallet, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with an Android smartphone.
However, American experts stress that despite the large investment of high-tech companies in NFC technology, American retelelers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
Therefore, the observers now hope that Apple’s entry into the market will still prompt the retelelers to accelerate and intensify the deployment of this technology to their outlets.
France's MFA: Paris's position on Mistrail supplies to Russia remains unchanged
The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France, Roman Nadal, stated Paris's consistent position on the supply to Russia of helicopter carriers of the Mistral type.
“I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Holland) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August: “Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
It's a European decision, not a French decision," quotes Mr. Nadal "Ria News."
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy agency replied to the question as to whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in the position of Paris on the implementation of the contract.
For more information on the supply of helicopter carriers to Russia, see "Ogonek" magazine "Mistrual" almost ours.
Ukrainian National Security Council: seven soldiers were killed in the area during the past 24 hours.
The representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Andrei Lysenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and 25 injured in the war zone in the east of the country over the past 24 hours.
The situation under Ilowai is extremely complex.
Until the withdrawal operation is completed, the details will not be disclosed.
Upon completion of the operation, data on losses and the reasons for the situation will be made public.
The perpetrators of such a situation will be held accountable,” Mr. Lysenko added, refusing to discuss the situation in more detail under Ilowaiski, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded.
According to the representative of SNBO, “every effort is being made to return the soldiers who have been taken prisoner”, reports ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had departed from Luhansk airport in the direction of the town of Giorgievka.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises.
The Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide the Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market-value company, access to luxury cruise ships and secured Prestige Cruises clients, as it competes with the larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, with sources reporting on Sunday warning that negotiations could still fail.
Prestige Cruises, a private investment company, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
Sources have asked to remain unnamed because the negotiations are not open.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while Apollo refused to comment on the information.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Her income was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 per cent over 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under Oceania and Regent brands, which jointly own eight cruise ships that travel to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She announced an income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the following years.
Companies race to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for primary public holding in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after the $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a share of 28 percent, Apollo owned a share of 20 percent, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP owned a share of 8 percent of the company, according to reports at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of the cruise traffic in North America, according to registration documents at the first public posting of Prestige Cruises.
Crimea television and radio can receive 250 million rubles of subsidies.
In the Russian Ministry of Communications, 250 million roubles are proposed for the State television and radio company Crimea in 2014.
According to the Ministry of Communications's draft regulation, which is posted on a single portal for the disclosure of information on the preparation of regulations, subsidies are to be used “to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of a modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also be used to purchase equipment, repair the roof and power supply systems at the building of the television and radio company founded in 1959, reports to RIA News.
Activists of the Hong Kong Democratic Movement are disrupting the Chinese representative's speech the day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress determined on Sunday the procedure by which only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the election of Hong Kong's leader in 2017.
All candidates should first receive the support of a majority of the nomination committee, which would probably be full of Beijingian loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot and has forced democratic activists to renew their promise to stop Hong Kong's financial center with the Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of Beijing’s paper describing China’s control over Hong Kong, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in the Special Administrative Region in June, and hundreds of thousands went to the city’s business centre and staged a sit-in.
The briefing by Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs of the State Council, Feng Wei, were also to address a series of briefings during the day.
The student activists announced that they would gather at the head of the Hong Kong Government building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to add 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced their intention to add 400 hectares of land on the West Bank belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to BBC, the decision to annex the land of Southern Bethlehem is related to the desire to repay the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers last June.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence announced the seizure on Sunday and instructed the military to establish an administration on the West Bank.
According to Gaza Strip spokesman Saib Arikat, world public opinion must hold Israel accountable for “the ongoing settlement activity on the West Bank and East Jerusalem”.
Putin demands Kiev to start negotiations on the “state” of eastern Ukraine.
According to Russian news reports of his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on “statehood” in the divided region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that East Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reviewed to enable the Russian-speaking region to defend its rights and interests.
But Putin’s call for the Kiev government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equals was consistent with the obvious strategy that he had followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared territory of Novorossia de facto independence to draw close to Russia, not to the West.
In an interview with Putin's State television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return separatist-held territory to the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently called the seized territories Novorassia, or New Russia, a name that refers to pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, a prisoner of illusion, reported ITAR-TASS.
“We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there”, he said.
Peskov said that Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, “because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict”.
The intervention of the Kremlin Press Secretary to correct Putin's “incorrect interpretation” of the words underlined the decision of the Russian leadership to behave towards the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much heavier battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were not Russian, and the polls showed widespread support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine before the conflict began.
Autonomy, which Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums, would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, by transferring to the Kremlin actual control of the territory that would link Russia’s main territory with Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, which was attached five months ago, there is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
There are also mines, factories and foundries in the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea, which produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
The Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, proposed in his inaugural speech on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, weigh constitutional amendments allowing for more control over their finances and the status of languages in the divided regions.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose weapons and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s last call for Kiev to agree with separatist leaders, as equals, followed the new rebel offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists took control of the town of Novoazovsk in an offensive about which Ukrainian security officials say they fear that it is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory up to Crimea.
This has led to extensive civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, between Novoazov and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko addressed a gathering of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that had been independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for the drafting of more severe sanctions against Russia to be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Iloweisk after two columns of Russian armoured vehicles and 1,000 soldiers had entered the Donetsk region last week to support troubled separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Iloweisk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian air ambulances captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, reported Lysenko on Sunday.
A naked scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco.
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his aversion to hackers who may have stolen naked photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged by the fact that a series of frank photographs of naked Jennifer Lawrence have been placed on the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with celebrities.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have some 60 frank photographs of the Star of the Hunger Games by Lawrence and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Kara Deleven, singer Rihanna, Ariane Grande and Leah Michel, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahowski, who lives in Melbourne, also allegedly stole photos from iCloud.
The name of the celebrities is 101 on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, said, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs should remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York City, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was “infamous” and that those targeted “feel that they were invaded”.
The hacker is believed to have 30 photographs of Palmer with former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two footage of her lying by the naked breast pool.
Palmer's film work includes Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of "Chuck" Strahowski and the actress from "Prohibited Reception" Browning didn't comment on stolen photos yesterday.
Representative Lawrence said to TMZ, "This is a blatant invasion of privacy."
Acter Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker by tweeting: "Putting photos stolen from a mobile phone is really no different from selling stolen goods."
It's just from a legal point of view, you can't tolerate publishing stolen photos.
A potential way to steal photos of naked celebrities has been discovered.
The massive hacking of star accounts may have been done through vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario was described by The Next Web.
A script in Python was released on Github, which allowed for the selection of passwords for the Find My Phone service of Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
The login and password of Apple ID is the same as that used to access the cloud Apple iCloud, from which celebrity photos were stolen.
The script allowed you to over-recognize the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces all kinds of combinations of characters, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The script author argued that the number of passwords entered in Find My Phone was unlimited.
If the security system is properly organized, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and the user informed of the hacking attempt.
Because of vulnerability, users have not received any reports of an attempt to access their account password.
The hackers recognized the password from Apple ID and used it to access the iCloud.
According to Hackapp on Twitter, vulnerability was detected two days ago, Saturday, and a scripting program was written to select passwords.
Currently, vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user Hackapp and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was common to many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability had been used to access the star account.
It's not me, plz RT.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister once again made foreign entries.
Although there is no firm evidence that the vulnerability of Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there was previously a wave of harmful actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In the case, Apple stated to the media that in this case the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, had also previously been hacked into Twitter.
If the intruders gained access to the iCloud described above, the password to the head of government's microblogging account could be stored there.
The Next Web was unable to get Apple's comments on vulnerability at Find My Phone.
Putin has granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-compartment
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the well-known Ukrainian athlete Anna Burak.
The relevant decree has been published on the Internet portal of legal information.
Earlier this year, an athlete moved to Russia permanently and applied to the Federation of the Modern Pentecostals for the opportunity to speak for the Russian Federation.
In 2013, she won two phases of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European personal championship and became the world champion in the mixed relay race, which is one of the new types of programme in this sport.
It holds a leading position in the current season.
According to the rules, she will need special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee to perform at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Anna Burak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to Chessman Catherine Lagno, a native of Lviv, who is twice the champion of Europe (2005, 2008), the world's blizzard (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of the Ukrainian women's team, she became the winner of the 2006 Turin chess olympiad, the 2013 Astana World Team Championship, and the 2013 Warsaw European Team Championship.
The SCR stopped investigating the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo.
The Russian Investigation Committee (RCC) has discontinued criminal proceedings in connection with the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft Red Wings.
The agency's press service reports it.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the flight engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the accident was caused by the increased speed of landing, the crew ' s failure to comply with standard boarding procedures, and the inadvertent introduction of the engines to the higher speed of direct propulsion.
The Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings, on a Prague-Moscow flight, crashed on 29 December 2012 while landing at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.
The aircraft took off behind the runway and caught fire.
The commander of the aircraft, the co-pilot and the flight engineer were killed at the scene.
Two flight attendants were taken to treatment facilities, where they subsequently died of injuries.
Three other flight attendants, hospitalized with serious injuries, were given long-term treatment.
In addition, a driver of a car travelling on the Kiev highway was seriously injured.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The Transport Prosecutor's Office conducted an inspection at Red Wings after the disaster, which revealed numerous irregularities.
The airline ' s licence was suspended in February 2013.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Yemelyanenko started training in SIZO
A well-known Russian mixed-style fighter, 33-year-old Alexander Yemelyanenko, who is in SIZO on charges of sexual assault on a domestic worker, has fully recovered from his injuries and has begun training.
It's being reported by the Championate.
Last May, the Russian Investigation Committee charged Alexander Yemelyanenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted and detained in Tambowe on 9 May following a traffic accident that caused him to fracture his thigh.
Yemelyanenko, Jr., was arrested until 31 August, and a sentence was scheduled for 1 September.
However, the trial was postponed and the investigation insisted on extending the period of detention until 30 September.
If proven guilty, the athlete faces a prison sentence of up to six years.
What's the strength, brother?
"Lenta.ru" recalls the most scandalous stories in Alexander Yemelyanenko's career.
In January this year, Yemelyanenko played his last match, losing a technical knockout to his compatriots, Dmitry Sinoski.
Alexander is the younger brother of the most famous fighter Fedor Yemelyanenko.
The latter is the four-time world champion of mixed martial arts, the four-time world champion and the seven-time Russian war sambo champion.
Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional human emotion.
The hearty expression of a face is biologically universal to mankind, and every organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not an accident, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, learned by Australian and U.S. scientists.
They described their discoveries in Evolution and Human Behavior magazine, and they can be summarized in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - the eyebrows bent down into a thin line of lips, the bloated nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and even the children born blind and never seen it, is noted by Aaron Sell, the lead author of the study.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has emerged to effectively manage disputes during conflict.
The more physical harm one person can cause to another, the more he is able to dictate his conditions, and he communicates them with anger.
Researchers have also found evidence of another hypothesis: physically powerful people are more likely to be angry and to use their hands, to impose conditions that are unfavourable to others, and to prefer violent methods to resolve conflicts peacefully.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of bargaining”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create the angry expression of a face must represent an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer - and thus force him to accept its terms as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, researchers modeled on the computer faces where each of the seven elements of the angry face was present or missing, and showed them to informants.
Although the lower eyebrows or the forward chin alone did not make the face evil, the more powerful man-like face of the study was unanimously accepted.
Man’s anger, like that of animals, is a threat: an exaggeration of self - power that compels consent and submission.
A man blowes his nostrils and presses his lips for the same purpose as a frog that inflates, or a baboon who shows his fangs.
Anger is “launched” by the respondent's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form most effectively showing the opposite side the consequences of the refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry face is arbitrary, all of them express the same thing," said anthropologist John Toubi.
The Ministry of Communications has offered 250 million rubles from Crimea Radio and Television.
The Ministry of Communications has proposed that 250 million roubles be allocated from the federal budget to the autonomous non-profit organization Crimea Tele-radiology Company in 2014.
This is stated in a draft government decree prepared by an agency which was consulted by Lena.ru.
According to the Explanatory Note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed “to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of a modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is proposed to upgrade the studio unit, the video walls and the central hardware and video server for the money allocated.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the fibre-optic link (VOLS) and the maintenance of the energy system.
Grants will be provided within the federal budget allocated to the Ministry of Communications.
The State broadcasting company Crimea was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, more than 75 per cent of the territory of the peninsula has been covered by television and radio.
In 2011, Crimea Television received a licence to broadcast in digital format.
