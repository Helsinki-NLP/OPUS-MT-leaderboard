28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell at the local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, saying, "He was finally doing well."
The body found in Westfield Moll on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia, reported to the San Francisco Forensic Unit.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told KGO to ABC in San Francisco that Frank, the former chef of the Boston distribution line, had his dream job as a cook at San Francisco's Sons & Doughters six months ago.
Sons & Doughters said they were "shocked and crushed" by his death.
"We're a small team that works as a friendly family and will be very missed," said the spokesman.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying in hostels at first, but lately, "He's finally doing well."
"He found an apartment, he dated a girl," Louis Galicia said to KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a great heart.
His way of communicating with his family was always to make us a dish, to cook us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any fight.
He was a brother who sailed the stream.
"In spite of all the bad things that are happening to this world, he was the unbounded diamond that shined brightly every day," he said.
Anyone in possession of information is requested to call the SFPD Hot Line at 415-575-4444.
Churkin said that the United Nations meeting on Crimea was useful.
The Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, said that the United Nations Security Council meeting on Crimea had been useful, transmitted by Interfax.
"I think the discussion was good for us, and we gave them information about what happened," said Churkin.
He explained that in closed consultations he had provided Member States with information on incidents in the territory of the Republic of Crimea and read out a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, which “expressed concern and outrage at the attempted terrorist attack and sabotage in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.

The size of Italy ' s public debt has risen to record levels
Italy's public debt in June 2016 exceeded Euro2.248 trillion.
At the central bank, the countries stated that the amount was the historical maximum, transmitting the RIA News.
The previous negative record was set in May this year.
At that time, the amount of public debt reached 2,228 trillion euros.
It is noted that in the first half of the year the debt burden of Italy increased by Euro77.2 billion.
It was previously reported that Italy ' s public debt stood at 132.7 per cent of the country ' s GDP at the end of 2015.
Meanwhile, the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Pierre Carlo Padoán, projected a decline to 130.9 per cent in 2016 and to 123.4 per cent of GDP in 2018.
The airport paid 141 victims of the attack at Domodedovo.
141 people received charitable payments from the Aviation Foundation, which was set up by the management of Domodedovo Airport to assist victims of the 2011 attack, reports Interfax.
According to Aleksandr Vlasov airport press secretary, two other applications are under consideration.
“The foundation continues to provide charitable assistance to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and provides comprehensive assistance to resolve existing issues,” added Vlasov, recalling that a website of the foundation was set up specifically to facilitate interaction with victims, providing full information on the procedures for the provision of charitable assistance.
In 2011, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device in a foreign airline flight hall in Domodedovo.
The terrorist attack killed 37 people and injured 172 others.
Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years.
The International Group of Biologists concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenlandic polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, transmits RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the eye crystalline of 28 Greenlandic sharks.
The largest shark, longer than five metres, may be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in shark longevity, leading to slow development.
Females of Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only by the age of 150.
Previously, it was thought that the longest vertebrate animals lived next door to the shark, the Greenland whale.
The oldest known species was just over 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of the Sovbeza Russian Federation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin by decree changed the composition of the Russian Federation's Security Council, reporting to the Kremlin press service.
It was previously reported that Putin had removed President Sergei Ivanov's chief of staff, Anton Vino, as his successor.
Ivanov will now serve as Special Representative of the President for Environmental, Environmental and Transport Affairs.
The Deputy Secretary of the Council, Rashid Nurgaliev, was removed from the permanent membership of the Russian Federation Security Council.
The council includes Sergei Ivanov, Anton Vino, half of the president's PFLP, Sergei Moylo, and half the PFLP, Nikolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov has been relieved of his post as head of the President's administration.
By presidential decree, Sergei Ivanov was relieved of his duties as head of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov has been appointed Special Representative of the Russian Federation for the Environment, Ecology and Transport.
Anton Vino, formerly deputy to Sergei Ivanov, has been appointed as the new chief of administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to be transferred to another job.
Should we go to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief physician of Olga Bogus Sanatorium.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to a sanatorium?
Sanitary resorts are essential not only for treatment, but also for disease prevention.
In a sanatorium, a person can check his or her body and get medical advice on how to live so that his or her health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations would not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal to the body, and it's not something to be dissuaded from.
Persistent stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.
And the stress is about 90% of the visitors.
People in large cities between the ages of 45 and 55 are the most affected.
So it's better not to complicate things and let yourself rest in time.
Studies show that 98 percent of people have reduced their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend a vacation with the kids, you don't have to break up with them.
Children, even the youngest, are provided with health programmes, which include both diagnostic services, paediatric consultations, tests and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children’s swimming pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, and physical exercise.
The course of procedure is determined by the doctor, taking into account individual indications and the characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, an animator club with children is generally available in sanatoriums, where children can attend play classes and various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even to guests with babies, provide breast-feeding facilities and provide an experienced nanny.
Soft winters, long summers, the abundance of sunny days per year (over 300) create good conditions for a year-round rest at the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Waters.
And then the body doesn't just need to rest in the summer.
So there's no need to be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most of the procedures are indoors and don't depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for adults.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Waters region is, of course, therapeutic mineral sources: Slavianovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters are unique and affect the various systems of the body.
Water varies by temperature, number of salts, general mineralization, chemical composition and gas composition.
The doctor picks up the water depending on the patient's condition.
For example, Narzan has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating effects, re-establishing gastrointestinal tract functions and metabolism.
Essentukki-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract and reduces sugar levels.
The "Essentuke New" produces anti-inflammatory, gallstone and urinary effects.
The water Slavanovskaya has the same effects.
When assigning water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the circulatory system.
If there's signs of hypertension, he picks up less salty water because salts hold the liquid, which increases the pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires a regime: water should be drinking at a certain time, at the right quantity and at a specific temperature.
Various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are now available in sanatoriums.
What types of recovery based on the natural features of the North Caucasus can be obtained at resorts in the region?
In the vicinity of Fiveigorsk, for example, there is a salty Lake Tambukan, from which tin mud is useful for joints, spines, and internal organs.
It produces anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immunomodulating effects.
They're recreational walks on individualized routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the mineral source Narzan.
You can also take baths of wine, pearls, iodine, selenium, sage lacory, depending on what a doctor assigns you.
Let's prolong the procreation.
What can we do to keep the harvest running until the end of the season?
It's from Julia Belopuchova, the agronomist and the lady of the house.
It is time for the tall Tomatos to have a haircut: to remove the new shepherds, to cut the tops, to remove all leaves to the penultimate brush with the fruit and the flowering with the small cords - they will not be ripe.
All tomatoes, regardless of the “constitution”, as well as peppers and eggplants, are fed with salt-superphosphate extracts, treated with biopreparats (preservative - to accelerate the filling and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Baktofit - to prevent disease, Immunococytophitis - to increase immunity, Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocide, Phytoverm - if there are pests).
In late summer, only copper corn, colloidal sulphur, and green soap should be used.
We're doing the last watering of the plants.
The long-fingered cucumbers in the greenhouse let the lower, naked part of the stem lie on the ground, water the warm water and the Circon solution, and put the stem 5-7 cm compost on the ground.
It is also easy to extend the fruitage of the courgette: cut down the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution to the whole fertiliser, and put the fertile soil under the bush.
In order to protect against the cold of the night, place an arc of hidden material above the line.
Keep the plants open during the day and close after sunset.
Signs of an end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists saw signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in 20 years.
According to analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the GDP of the Russian Federation shows a positive trend, with GDP falling by 0.8 per cent in annual terms in the second quarter.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the Russian economy slowed down to 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The situation has also recently been stabilized by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development.
Slow growth ahead.
According to CDB experts, the recession in the Russian economy is behind us.
“The index estimate of Russian GDP shows that the recession is behind us and the slow growth of the economy ahead,” says the Bank of Russia's bulletin “What Trends Speaks”.
The GDP model estimate for the current quarter has been raised to 0.4 per cent by regulators, and the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Development, in the second quarter the Russian Federation ' s GDP fell to 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.
In the second quarter, the seasonally purified decline in GDP was 0.2 per cent of the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the recession stopped: in April it was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June the change in GDP was between 0 and 0.15, quotes the representative of RIA's IRE "News".
The slowing down of the Russian economy during the last five quarters indicates that it has passed the bottom.
Among other markers indicating signs of recovery in the national economy, Bloomberg refers to the growing demand for electricity and rail transport, and the revitalization of business.
If the year is a leap year, it is understandable that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half of that of an additional working day.
Add to this a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it's hard to get accurate data, and plus or minus 0.5% of a half a year's volume can also be explained by seasonality,” Cyril Yakovenko of ALORO BROKER explains.
There are, however, other more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressures.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared with 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
In fact, for the past two weeks, Rosstat has been recording deflation.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the performance of the ruble, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery that should be followed by indicators from the real economy," Yakovenko stresses.
In addition, industrial production in the Russian Federation has increased since April.
The figure rose by 1.7 per cent in June.
The rate of decline in foreign trade has slowed from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The situation in the labour market, where unemployment has fallen to 5.4 per cent, is also showing positive developments.
It was only lower in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the favourable situation in the labour market, the question of the real disposable income of the population is left to be desired.
In annual terms, the figure decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This may hinder economic recovery, as household expenditures contribute significantly to GDP.
In general, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the tight policies of the Bank of Russia can also be cited as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
Lack of investment is also a negative factor, which constrains the development of industrial capacity.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the Russian economy will be slowing down to -0.5 per cent, as opposed to -3.7 per cent in 2015,” says the GK Forex Club analyst Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, which was recently launched in Russian football and was well established in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not yet been developed in summer sports.
While former foreigners are in favour of Russia at the Rio Olympic Games, in most cases they are natives of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
In Rio de Janeiro, however, we can see the reverse process: quite a large number of Russians are flying the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of change of nationality varies.
Some parents took someone to another country when they were little, leaving no choice.
Someone failed to compete for a seat in the Russian team.
And some thought that the best conditions for development in sports would be created abroad.
Aif.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
A 27-year-old girl's German passport says her name is Lisa Red.
But earlier, she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Only four years after the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
That's where she decided to follow in her older sister's footsteps to do a little athletics.
Like my sister, Lisa chose to jump with a sixth.
If she stayed in Russia, I don't think she'd be able to move Elena Isinbaev off the throne.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be the only girl of our kind, though ex-girlfriend, in the sixth-jumping sector.
Her best achievements in this sport were the 2010 European Bronze and the 2016 continental silver championship, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
==Biography==He was born in 1986 in Novokuznetsk.
Her parents are religious propagandists in the evangelical direction.
Many because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in a small town called Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started a fight back in school.
In good performance, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued her studies at the US Training Centre under the leadership of another former Russian, Vladislav Izbornikov.
At the 2012 London Olympics, Elena lost in her first battle.
But at the World Cup that same year, it was a victory.
Before that, by the way, she had won silver at the 2010 World Championship.
This was followed by the 2013 bronze and 2014 silver.
The 26-year-old Maria was born in Yaroslavl, where she first met the synchronous swimming.
But it would be wrong to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
She soon joined the U.S. team and performed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
Clearly, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America, their numbers are the ceiling.
A new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Christine Shaldybina at the age of 11 when her parents decided to continue the girl's education in the art gymnastics beyond the ocean.
Until then, the girl had a favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
When she emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth team of the country and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
She certainly didn't have to fight for the first positions on the world stage, but for the US, she staged a real breakthrough, bringing the star-spank team to the Rio Olympics.
Another former artist of ours, Jan Berezko-Marggrander, who is in favour of Germany.
Jana was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had a better chance of joining the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In fact, Jana was only able to take 17 places, not enough to enter the finals in her personal first.
But two years earlier, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games, a young man.
Another gymnast, except this time, Irina Sazonova.
If the routes of emigration of the sportswomen mentioned earlier can be described as standard, the choice of Irina’s family is very unusual — Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd Sports School.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became a champion of the country.
True, Ira is training in Russia, but he's coming to his country on purpose so as not to lose his skill.
In Rio, she didn't do as well as she'd like.
The best place is 40 in the private line.
There is very little information about the swimmer Maria Ugolkova in Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria has lived and trained in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it played under the Russian flag, showing good results – even the country’s record at 200 meters of batterfly.
In 2015, she acquired Swiss citizenship and became a red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place on the 4×100 integrated relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project that brought together some 6,000 francs to pay for her preparations for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old freestyle fighter, Adam Batirov, spent most of his career under the Russian flag.
In that time, Hasavürt became a three-time winner of the European Championships, a Russian champion, and an international-class Russian sports master.
When he stopped joining our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from the sports posts.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships, where Batirov was already represented by Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a ride to the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-Rossian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less known at home than even the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The thing is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started sports gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, the best result was 40 places on parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting into the Olympic Games in gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Nasteh, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronized swimming activities, showing good results at the national level.
In 2014 at the 2014 European Championships in Berlin, the girl took sixth place in the synchronized voyage.
In the duet with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
She was the fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Creiter is in favor of Israel.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, Dmitri became the national champion at the age of 17.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Creiter also wins the gold of the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitri is involved in long jumps and triple jumps.
31-year-old Albert is another resident of Hasawurt, who, after a long campaign for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, however, he competed for the Krasnoyarsk High School of Sports, even becoming a national champion in 2011.
==Early life==Oleg Antonov, 28, was born in Moscow as a member of the USSR volleyball team, Yaroslav Antonov.
Just one year before his son Yaroslav was born, he was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained permanently there.
In 2015, he became a bronze winner of the European Championship in his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and joined his family in the middle of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original target was Norway, but it was impossible to get to that northern country, having to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued his training in free combat.
Soon he won the world's first juniors, and later he qualified for the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the competition.
Once again, a free fight, and again a former Russian.
This time, we're talking about a North Ossetian who emigrated to Spain, Tymuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is now in favour of the Spanish team.
Before that, however, a 30-year-old athlete had also made good progress in Russia.
He became the bronze winner of the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
The rules of non-entry, Tymuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last one on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in Dagestan Mahachkal, the capital, Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur began boxing on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has been the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 became the champion of the youth world.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why do kids need Cossack classes in school?
According to Governor V. Kondratiev, "the police should not be raised with stocks and parades, but systematically."
They must grow up and at least realize that they are Cossacks and education must be Cossacks from the age of 7.
But so far, I think, this work is going on formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If Cossack classes embrace all the positive things that have been built up in the past, at a qualitatively new level, I'd be happy to.
If everyone's in the air and they don't know how, the new idea will turn out to be cheap populism.
WHC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors in the country ' s economy.
There is an attacker on funds allocated to the public sector from different levels of budgets.
According to the Office of the Attorney-General, overcharges are one of the most common crimes in the area of HKH.
As a result, consumers in the region have overcharged more than 170 million roubles in energy.
The other day, the Krasnodar Krai Prosecutor ' s Office had also found evidence of the inclusion of unreasonable costs in tariffs.
A total of 4 million roubles were charged to IV Consulting (cold water) for the rental of vehicles at a higher price than the market price.
And there's a lot of such examples in the country.
According to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection rate from the population is 94 per cent.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of the proceeds of crime, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as head of the fund, which was involved in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov entered into contracts with entrepreneurs, which were not actually performed, but were paid for.
Businessmen just gave him most of the money back.
And as the owner of the PC, Makarov raised money from the public, but the service providers didn't pay or spend it on their own.
As a result, there are millions of rubles of damage to the budget and residents.
The scheme of makarov's machinations is, alas, typical of Russia.
There has been a wave of arrests and detentions of leaders of the Criminal Code who have stolen money from citizens throughout the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Cohan, by the way, is ongoing, also by way of a former councillor accused of fraud of 91.7 million roubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012 - 2013, he established six companies in Elizovo, Kamchat province, and created three limited liability societies.
One of them was contracted to the PC, and the other two were paid centres, i.e. they took money from the population.
However, A. Cohan's energy did not transfer the funds, but spent on himself, the beloved.
It's hard to sue in the area of LHC.
There's no case going on, no case going on.
And "helps" in this very complicated housing legislation, Svetlana Rashvernev, executive director of HKH Control.
We don't have the time to make one law, as we make a new one that should make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, on VAC issues.
The lawyers themselves acknowledge that housing law has received very little attention in higher education.
Denials of criminal proceedings and delays in investigations are also reported in the Office of the Attorney-General.
Less than half of the 3,500 crimes in progress in 2015 were referred to court.
For the remainder, the investigation became protracted and one in five was suspended due to the failure to identify the accused person.
Often, the shortcomings of law enforcement agencies are reduced to gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the authorities of inquiry are slow to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of forgery - only 60 criminal cases have been initiated.
In the five months of the current year, the number had increased only slightly - 99.
And what is falsifying the protocol of the assembly of tenants?
This means changing the management of the house, financial and other matters bypass the views of the owners.
It also means that the housing and public services market cannot be reached by normal companies that want to work honestly, not to feed the population.
So, tenants in minus, small and medium-sized businesses, too.
First of all, through the eradication of corruption as such throughout the State, Anton Jarkov, member of the State Property Committee, is certain.
This work is now being actively pursued.
These are not just isolated actions; they are targeted against corruption.
Of course, not all regions are in such a sad situation.
In particular, the capital doesn't smell like scandal.
Why is there no such scandal in Moscow as in many other regions?
Because the capital government has shown iron will and ordered order, told the Aif, Anatoly the Chosen, a member of the State Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both the personnel issue, the legislative amendments, and the legal education.
Managers are closely supervised and all have been licensed.
Citizens ' complaints are dealt with promptly in public space (both residents ' communications and responses are posted on the Moscow Government portal).
Many do not simply pay for monthly receipts, but pay close attention to what is written there, how the house is kept.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and obligations of resource providers and managers is very high.
Plus, Moscow is testing the validity of tariffs on housing and public services - a large part of the budget is allocated to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
It's probably all together, and it explains the calm situation in Moscow.
So it's all about the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the unwitting should change their place of work.
Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdoğan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan proposed an ultimatum to the United States, offering a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d'état.
That was what he said when he spoke to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdoğan called on Americans to give up their support for the “Fethullahist terrorist organization”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey calling on the US to change its position.
Experts believe that Turkey’s division with the West is increasing and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO sooner or later.”
It's either a FETO coup or a democratic Turkey.
She must make that choice," quotes the Anatolian Agency, Erdoğan's address on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
Turkey’s president once again, but more than ever, demanded that the US comply with his demand for the first time in the immediate aftermath of the rebellion.
It should be recalled that, on the night of 16 July, Turkish military officials in Turkey attempted to overthrow the legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the Head of State.
However, after Regep Erdoğan addressed the population, the mutiny was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In all, some 8,000 people were suspected of being in the ranks of teachers and scientists, in addition to the military.
According to Recep Erdoğan, they were mentored by Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, United States.
Erdoğan’s supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the coup d’état.
The United States denied all claims against it by refusing to issue Gulen and recommending a change of tone.
The latest statement of the State Department on this subject was made at the time of Erdoğan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey, who insists on his own and also demands on his other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfil his obligations under the EU migration agreement if Brussels does not state the date on which the visa restrictions for Turkish citizens will be lifted”, stated Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer Chelik on August 9.
He said that Ankara’s amendment of the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe’s own security.
Note that on August 1, German Vice Chancellor Zigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders to migrants in order to facilitate visa treatment with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement made by the head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu was made last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not exclude that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance if it did not receive the support expected from it.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the field of defence is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign states in the defense field, importing missiles,” Chavushoglu said in an interview with Anadulu.
Turkey, he said, now needed to build its own defence system on the basis of its technology, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
“To date, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others”, said the Minister.
Experts believe that all this points to Turkey’s serious disagreements with the West and the country’s reorientation towards the East.
Evgeny Minchenko, head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, believes that Recep Erdoğan is now playing his game and cannot go into a violent confrontation with the West.
He's got a lot tied to the West from a business point of view, and from a military point of view (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdoğan will try to balance by maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a fully obedient person in this post,” Aif.ru explained the expert.
According to him, it is possible that, following statements by the Turkish leader (on the non-payment of EU compensation, the demand for visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States), he will be pressured.
"Regep Erdoğan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press him on humanitarian issues, on dictatorial methods of governing the country, and so on," says Minchenko.
The head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, admits that the President of Turkey will change his view of relations with Russia as soon as it benefits him.
Eight months ago, Erdoğan was extremely tough on Russia and sought favor in the West in every way.
In a very short period of time, the situation has changed to the contrary.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again after a while.
I think Erdoğan has entered the period of shuttle diplomacy.
Between the two poles of the West and Russia, he will try to obtain the maximum benefit for himself," says Muhin.
In his view, the main challenge for Turkey’s president today is to retain political power in the country, and for that he needs Russia and his partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop the US from supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus will be reached with Turkey”, the expert believes.
A different view is taken by Anna Glasov, the head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East.
Turkey’s relations with both the EU and the US are now quite tense, and this is primarily due to the domestic policies that Erdoğan personally pursues.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reboot policies both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, have declared that they are prepared to change their position on a number of issues concerning Syria, that relations with Israel have been settled, and that there is active political engagement with Iran,” explained Aif.ru Glasov, suggesting that Erdoğan's next step would be to normalize relations with Egypt.
She said that Erdoğan’s current policy was a return to the foreign policy stance that Turkey had followed prior to the Arab revolutions.
“It was then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in a zero-neighborhood position.
The President of Turkey has now made very successful visits to Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's position on both the regional and international scene,” the expert believes.
Glasov believes that returning Turkey to its former relationship with the EU will be incredibly difficult, but the question now is whether the EU will start to respond harshly to Turkey, which can open borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Strike of junior doctors: Calls for new collective protests
The representatives of the junior doctors asked the union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over the new employment contract.
The Junior Physicians Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says the ministers were unable to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel a contract of employment negotiated with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of the members voting by secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCord said that the government had continued to “controversially remain silent” about the problems that, she said, had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, "In view of the current situation, the JDC leader voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in its entirety and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues."
In response to the Government's silence, the head of JDC today made a formal request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuing programme to expand collective protests, starting early in September.
The dispute resulted in young doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
BMA's junior doctor, Dr. Joan Malawana, resigned after a vote to cancel the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
He told the BMA members that the deal was a good one that should be accepted during the pre-vote meetings of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "The Bad Alliance"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden palace hall in St. Petersburg, I had a strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile seemed strained, and he hardly radiated warmth even according to his own self-restraint standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in contrast, repeatedly spoke of his "Dear Friend" Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdoğan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm suggested otherwise.
But the chilling chill coming from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first reason for the crisis was what he mentioned in his introductory remarks: Turkey hit a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at that moment was ferocious.
Mr. Putin broke out with an angry tirade accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even greater on the basis of the alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, State-controlled media carried out a staggering, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to be guilty of everything.
The most serious allegations were that Mr. Erdoğan's own family had profited from the illegal trade in oil from Syrian areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it strongly.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdoğan.
Russia could claim a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost deposed last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number plummeted by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly feel relieved when the flights finally resume.
They're peaking at the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables once Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists in there, tomatoes back here," as the report in Vedomosti said.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers to be a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this its long-standing dissatisfaction with the tortoise tempo of accession talks to the EU and Mr. Putin’s move to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won a bonus with Ankara for calling for support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Bear in mind, this is a tribute to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this brilliant palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described as a "alyan of bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West join forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still differ significantly.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
Perhaps it is self-evident that after almost three hours of initial talks, while two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even address the issue.
Turkey’s president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and given the possibility of a total catastrophe when a NATO member of Turkey hit a Russian jet fighter jet — it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Brenda RBS should be reduced to the role of a back-officer, according to the bank's executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the Scottish BBC that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and needed to be saved.
During this period, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of international sports sponsorship, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it's been decided that it's right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for banking services to individuals who will have more influence -- Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a client and employee tour in Invernessshire.
He said to the BBC Scotland, "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming more of a brand bank."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something quite different in its own population, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building a profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
"This is a good time for us to move the brand bank, because at the base (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for clients and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on the needs of our clients rather than our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can get those brands back, so I think it's a good time.
Francky Dettori goes to 3,000 winners with a Newmarket victory on Addiction.
Detori sprinkles champagne after a take in Newmarket leads to 3,000 wins.
Frankie Dettori's jockey won his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track, the Addiction trained by John Gosden.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this remarkable mark in smooth racing.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eidderi and Willie Carson.
Three times the champion of the Dettori jockey who had previously won the Guyyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm really excited because my family's here, too.
I'm really glad this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I moved in 30 years ago.
It's not a big social event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night since 20000 people.
I'm free of business, and I'm very innocent.
Detori accepts applause when she brings predisposition after victory.
Two jockeys have reached the level of obstacle racing: jockey champion Richard Johnson, and retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, 20 times, who won over 4,300 victories in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career victories.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern age, and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical tact that distinguishes him from the others in the weight room.
He's a great representative for the races, and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey of weekends and big races!
And seriously, Frankie's been bringing the winners to the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for the British races, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Francky Dettori celebrated this remarkable mark with a brand-new, fast horse slip.
From the fast finishes to the fast slips, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of the British smooth race for two decades.
They were ups and downs.
Many of the winners of the big races, including his famous "G7" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and was disqualified for doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed great willpower to challenge skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while -- Detori said earlier that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Putin's firing Sergei Ivanov's chief of staff.
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed representative for the environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President,” but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Wino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he was the head of the Office of the President's Protocol and the Cabinet, reporting on the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thanks for your trust."
I think the most important task for the administration is to support your work as head of State in drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be relieved of his position and recommended that Vino replace him.
Do Smiles Convince?
It's a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters for a long time and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was shown on State television, both men stated that the head of administration had resigned of his own free will.
But despite the smiles on the camera, it convinced few people here — especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, these are the unintended consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that a man once campaigned for as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russian environmental policy — was met with great scepticism.
In Putin's comments quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It's true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very difficult position, even a problematic post, for four years.
Well, I guess I was president's chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russia’s president after Putin’s second term, because Putin’s third term would be unconstitutional.
However, another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, took the position.
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson was fired after a fight with the producer.
Gibson was part of a fight on a show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced his resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday, before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences of opinion and opinion.
I regret that this happened,” he said in his statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be erased from the show, which is monitoring the FBI's team, are expected to be received later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor who had previously played the lead role in Darm and Greg's sitcom was on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "thinking as a criminal" and put my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of the day, but now it's not gonna be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team, and, most importantly, the best fans the show could ever dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: The fish landed in the garden of Banfa
A man from Banff sought help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bane thinks 75 fish could be sandstones left by a water storm.
Bane, who lives 500 metres from the sea, posted a film of this sight in Periscope, hoping that someone could shed some light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
The bridge is now connected to Fife.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers connected the northern passage and the Viaduk Quinsferri Crossing, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It's the first of four joints between the painting veres, which are now approaching completion near all three of the bridge's sawons.
The Fife Bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vants of bridge.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinberry Crossing.
We're all witnesses to engineering art on a really epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the connection between the viaduct and the bridge is a virtuoso operation using extremely precise assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79% of the total bridge is now in place, and for the last section of the canvas, concrete is being laid out today in Rostika, which means that the whole of the canvas is ready to go up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first link on every bridge project is always a milestone.
In this amazing project, this connection is the most modern construction art.
Once the last section of the road had been installed and connected to the expanding northern pylon road, we were left to close the remaining gap on the north side, or on the shore side.
This was done by pushing the viaduk of the northern approach 700 millimeter south.
It was a massive, yet very delicate operation.
Large, because the viaduk is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and should have been raised to an angle of about 3%.
Fine, because the clearances the team was working on were tiny — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Rescue in the Gulf of Moelfr: Three men's "lucky to stay alive"
Three men's lucky to be alive after being thrown off a fishing boat in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 1:20 p.m. in British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in the Gulf of Moelfr.
Three men tried their best to get to safety while their ship continued its course.
"We saw their ship ploughing next to them and suggesting the worst," said Moelfrey's lifeboat, Vince Jones.
"Happily, by the time we hit the water, a strong wind had taken him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and a third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and caught in a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were taken on board the shore lifeboat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky they're alive and unharmed.
The boat engine had an emergency breaker, but somehow it got off the man who ran the boat when it collapsed.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people away from the couch and engages them in some physical activity.
Time in the screen was initially limited to television, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
It's so great to see that technology and street activity aren't mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the whole thing, which is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which later produced a series of cartoons, play cards and other branches).
Like many other pop cultural phenomena, all of this was overtaken by events just before this new game became available in the US, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed at the time because of a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, smartphone players go looking for Pokémons who are tracked through GPS and, when discovered, can be 'photo' (through a screenshot on your phone) or 'captured'.
The generation that played the game, when younger, joined in a groovy hobbie by breaking away from the couches to find out.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in the number of steps that a "normal" person walks daily.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch application that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people they track, who performed 30 minutes of exercise every day, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary levels.
Many health campaigns that convince people to find 30 minutes, get off the couch, and be active every day, have not been answered, because most health messages are boring and express themselves to people who look unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of advantages too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she drags people out to do what they love.
Thus, three fundamentals of health are covered: movement, fresh air, and sunlight, and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring nerds looking for something to complain about.
And, yes, someone might come across the door.
So what?
There's been a breach.
Because even though smartphone apps like Fitbit might have been able to track our physical activity before, they didn't give us a reason to study, as this game gives us.
The new one will come along, and the use will weaken over time.
However, the success of Pokemon will result in more games that combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Bales wins the gold of the absolute first in women's gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the fuss.
Simone Bales is invincible for all of this.
It's dynamic on a back-up jump.
Unforced on a log.
It's overwhelming on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of absolute first champion on Thursday, placing the gap between herself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under close Olympic scrutiny.
Her total score was 62.198, a long way from the silver medalist and teammate Eli Reisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alya Mustafa.
Bales from the United States performed on the gymnasium log during the final of the women's individual absolute first in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bales became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the title of absolute first and fifth, establishing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She cried when she showed her final score and her long journey was over by now.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare trackers, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Bales has spent the last three years, dominant in her sport, winning 15 medals of the World Cup -- including 10 gold medals -- with such stunning programs in their mix of industriousness and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One final test was waiting in Brazil, not so much a competition between Bales and the rest of us in this field, but between her and the cargo of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's house in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unfulfilled expectation.
Simone Bales of the United States, on the left, and Eli Reisman hugged after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the finals of the women's individual absolute first in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Byles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of the retired coordinator of Martha Karoli's national team.
While Bailes insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, she did not.
Part of her free exercise program -- the one that includes her brand-new pass -- is set up on Latin American music, which would fit just like a house on the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandfather and grandmother, being a child starter and discovered by Coach Aimee Burman's mother during a visit to the gym where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn't lost a single absolute first since summer 2013, a line of luck that should go on as long as Bailes wants.
Although Mustafa was given a small advantage by two rotations, it was a mirage.
Gymnastic log and free exercise — where Bales defends the title of world champion — are ambushed.
She went forward again with 15.433 on a log and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
Reisman gently hugged her while they waited for the final account -- a clean formality -- and the tears appeared around the shiny red with the white and blue eyeliner of the Bales, when the design that she had once recorded in the clipping album came to fruition.
Reisman's performance was a small revenge for four years ago when she shared third place, but lost Mustafa's bronze on a tai break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of a team that Americans call "grandmother" was far ahead.
She was sending kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, covered in return, which at times seemed in question.
As for Bailes, the viral tweet of 19 years old from the beginning of this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who had died in the most deadly attack in the case of Phoenix's first serial killer over the past decade sat in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot dead on 12 June when their car was parked on the carriageway, declared to the authorities.
The perpetrator fired approximately eight rounds from a pistol standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, and then escaped from another vehicle, as reported in the report.
The police claim that the triple homicide does not appear to be the result of a robbery, as the perpetrator did not take the wallets or $2,900 from one of the adult victims.
The Finix police officer, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting had prompted the investigators to verify whether he had been involved in the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American regions for four months.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of the house," Howard KPHO said to CBS, early this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan of the late 1990s, the black BMW of the late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence which led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, the aim of which was an empty truck half an hour before the triple murder, which was believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found casings and pulled a bullet out of the seat and fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old with a microcephalus: "It's getting better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picsivto loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund's microcephalus is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picsivto, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not really true -- of course you're signing up for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized treatment facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that," said Picsivto.
Edmund walks with walkers.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund invented for "please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just plain sign language, she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalus can arise from a variety of different circumstances: genetic infections, such as Edmund, during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zeka.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary significantly.
It is too early to tell how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zeke virus.
Pixivto remembers emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I keep telling you what was gonna happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a life forecast, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picsivto has some encouraging advice for mothers of babies with congenital defects because of Zeke.
It's getting better.
You know everything will be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding is responsible for rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected to fall over the state up to and including Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of Mississippi have come out of the banks and threaten large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, as reported by the National Meteorological Service.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bell Edwards, stated that government officials were in constant contact with the local authorities and had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, representative of the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that requests were being made for transportation for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only Tanjipahoa's arrival had requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The risk of flooding remains valid until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
Meteo said in a statement that an extra 3 to 5 inches could pop into the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood was expected until Friday, as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comit River near Baton Rouge and the Aimit River near Den Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set a flood level record last weekend.
Synoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in peri-urban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that flooding downstream in the Assenchen parish was a threat, as those bloated rivers would flow slowly into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday morning.
Squads were still pulling people out of floods in the districts of Aimit and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepdaughter were among those rescued early Friday at Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the Beaver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said that the other stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept coming," said Hansford.
She's reached my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest tributary she'd seen in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family members have a disability, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says the flood is spreading rapidly, as the rain continues, noting that officials are considering the evacuation order.
Krautmann says that an observer outside Livingstone reported a 13.75-inch rain fall from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated with rainfall from the environment.
Heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of residents from their homes in the parish of Tanjipahoa and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, the authorities state.
WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, reports that councillor Tanjipahoa spoke about 200 flooded houses.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but they're both flooded now.
The President of the parish, Robbie Miller, stated that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets in high water.
Shelters were opened in the city of Aymit and the city of Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
"They'll have a chance to go home as soon as the water starts to fall," he said.
In the city of Hammond, the Tanjipahoa parish was closed down about two dozen streets due to high water levels, and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said the city manager Lacey Landrum.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Services, Rupert Lacey, reported that the heavy rain continued on the Gulf coast.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Aymit, has been living in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Tawson said, "and it's still pouring on the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "battered with bullets," survives a shootout in Philadelphia.
Police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting at a 6-year-old in town this week.
The baby's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandma and Grandpa say Brown sustained numerous gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was mutilated by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez said to the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is hospitalized in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
Family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who was shot in the Germantown quarter.
Three men, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old, were also shot.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were reported to be in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting to the station.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been an exchange of fire between several armed men.
The semi-automatic weapon casings, attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons, were used to detonate the scene.
It seems like it was definitely a long battle.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So there appear to have been a number of armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting,” reported Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi to the station.
Many homes and cars in the area were also damaged.
No arrests have been made and the police are reportedly looking at surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the arm by a stray bullet on Tuesday when he played in front of his home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Lori?
This is what I call this year's female Olympic team for several reasons.
First, I've been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simone Bales, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Lory" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Coshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It also strengthened black and Latin American women ' s presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the female gymnast number one has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
The world may now have witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time World Championships Simone Bales, Douglas and Lori Hernandez, performing unexpected yet virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in a woman's individual absolute first.
And Ali Reisman's teammate earned silver.
We're witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like it in gymnasiums all over the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Lori have all chosen the same path as Ali and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the final five, because the next Olympic gymnast will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Karoli's training.
But in reality, gymnastics is expensive, and gymnasts are trained first in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents who pay the cost of education, equipment, travel, uniforms, contributions to competitions, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy peri-urban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and it's an expensive and long-term duty for gymnast families.
Aimee Burman, coach Simone Bales, and Maggie Hani, coach Lori Hernández, both trained their athletes from the moment they started gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and affordable gymnastics training for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnasium fund 20 years ago.
In my organization, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mostly black and Latin American) and have raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to exhausting work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive impact on good health, success in school and work.
It's the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
Sporting is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Ali, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison, for this serious demonstration of the Women's Power in winning command Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The junior doctors went on to call for further strikes after Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected.
Ministers had hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing on an amended contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the contract, saying that NHS was on "no ground" and any further delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes night and weekend changes to improve out-of-hour services.
Dr. Helen McCott, chairman of the BMA Young Doctors' Committee, said in a statement last night: “The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it feeds the current labour crisis and that it cannot be applied fairly to all doctors.”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors are reappointed, progress is needed and time is running out.
The VMA's attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes complete silence on the part of the Government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the fears of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to organize further strikes.
The last strike at the end of April delayed some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurse appointments, while nurses and consultants were hired to replace doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing on a modified contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants better pay for the weekend for 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue their strikes.
Mortimer stated: “The strikes do little or nothing, but they put pressure on already-working teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, nurses and their families”.
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the Associate Doctors Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of guardians and corporate information policy.
Workers hoped that the continued positive assistance on other important topics — such as staff distribution, learning flexibility, additional training for those returning after a career break, cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differentials in medicine — was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health intended to meet the conditions achieved by the WMA in November, February and May.
A 2-pound drug a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use the drug in two pounds a day, after the authorities have recommended that they give it to more people and for a longer time.
The anti-removation drug has reduced the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart problems.
The drug is already scheduled for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new one.
The NICE National Health Service has advised that it should be given to people for four years to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE now advised the British National Health Service to give it to people for four years to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
An estimated 140,000 people in England have a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of galleries.
If the plaque is torn to pieces, it could cause a clot blocking blood access to the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the flow of blood and block the bloodstream to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already experienced one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Tickagreglor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 milligrams of tick-heater for 12 months, then 60 milligrams with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said, "Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention methods, with about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that the Tekagralore, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
In recommending the ticking wheel, we are pleased to be able to expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of the ticker — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment beyond that period.
The culture of PC possession allows for the flourishing of vote fraud in Muslim areas.
Ex-Mayor Tower-Hamletts Lutfur Rahman was suspended last year for corruption, triggering a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the closing of eyes, which has resulted in the widespread falsification of votes in Muslim communities, according to the destructive government report released today.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles is criticized by the police, election observers and city administrators for ignoring evidence of election irregularities because of “excessive sensitivity about race and religion”.
A former community secretary, now an anti-corruption king, reported that religious intimidation of voters was so severe that the police should be allowed to put cordons outside the polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identification cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At this point, voters must simply state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting permanent ink on people's fingers when they surrender their ballots in order to exclude anyone from voting twice.
Better protection for whistle-blowers is needed, said Sir Eric.
He called for greater press access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it”, he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street due to a voting scandal at Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor of Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office because of a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, “acted his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of the Muslim believers to vote for him”.
Up to 300 votes were cast in doubt or were the result of a person's vote, introduced by someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about post-vote fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the photograph, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your identity card to prove who you are.
His report states: “There has been evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There were fears that public institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of `political correctness' to ethnicity and religion.”
Cheese Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from work on the ballot papers to stop the “sound harvest”.
The report before Theresa May also calls for stricter registration checks to prevent the use of the electoral roll for immigration fraud and privileges.
Consideration is being given to requiring voters to present an identity card before voting.
Use permanent ink on people's fingers as soon as they give up their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on requests for automatic mail voting.
Remove political campaigners and activists from work with completed correspondence votes and postal envelopes.
To empower the police to install cordons around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation in accordance with the 1983 People's Act.
To make it illegal to take photographs at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force voters to go to the booth one at a time.
Sir Eric is fiercely attacking the city's police, claiming that this is “surprising” that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The electoral court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts”, he said.
He was found guilty without reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful "checks for the ticking" of the city administration's electoral registration offices.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's court order in Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of the parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Crazy about Kate's bike counterpart and the other celebrities of the Rio Olympics.
The fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week were crazy about French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who turned out to be an impressive duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic contestant is not the only sportswoman fighting for gold this summer who can boast of her own famous doppelganger — at least, according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people appearing on our screens so far, FEMAIL has compiled a list of olympics with more than a superficial similarity to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: Member of the U.S. male archer team Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate's double on the bike track, many people online have rushed to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A man's archer team in the United States, Brady Ellison, caused a hurricane on Twitter, after images of him that looked frighteningly like a Wolf star from Wallstreet.
And in fact, the archer found out about social media madness and admitted that he'd heard that he looked like Leo ever since he was a kid.
"I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe with the exception of the vegetation on my face," Brady Huffington Post said.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt point to even more this year: the striking resemblance between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast, Alya Mustafain, with her big, articulate eyes, is said to be a true copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron Van Der Burg has been compared to the star of Glee Club Matthew Morrison for many years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user thinks Nathan is the "sport version" of the Start actor.
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The silver medalist, the Russian swimmer, Yulia Yefimova, can boast not only of the tanned skin and blond hair of actress AnnaLinn McCord, but Nathan Adrian of the US team, according to fans, is like the "sport version of Joseph Gorgon Levitte".
Fat women: The football star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, right, have the same shapes of face and eye
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
By creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this pair.
One Twitter user recently contacted the site to make public his enthusiasm that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
Indeed, the US football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar facial and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Lynny, as well as the winning gold medal for gymnast Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful, broad smile, which resembles the smile of the star "Appoint Success" Gabriel Union.
Olympiad commentator at the CBC apologizes for speaking of the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
The analysis of Byron McDonald's fourth place on the finish line of 14-year-old Ay Yanghan on the 4x200 m female freestyle relay has outraged CBC viewers in a live broadcast of the Olympics.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started as a stench" and "dead as a pig" during the swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was offline when he started expressing his own opinion at the end of the final female relay 4x200 m freestyle.
You could hear McDonald being drawn to the CBC comment team to "dilute it in color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, starting like a stench, dying like a pig.
Thanks for that.
China's 14-year-old swimmer, Ay Yangan, sailed the second phase of the relay at 1:57.79 – 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rak, allowing Canadians to catch up with China.
The audience across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language used
Emmett McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announce that a 14-year-old swimmer from China died like a pig?"??"
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan of China, in the final of the 4x200 m female relay, was said to the freestyle, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Twitter criticism immediately hit Byron McDonald, with many urging him to fire him.
Twitter users didn't stop when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who was broadcasting CBC, apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, 'We're sorry that the comment about the swim show was aired.'
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
IFOR concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement
A fellow commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald.
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The network also rushed to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
We acted quickly last night to apologize to our live viewers and our social media subscribers.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments referred to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, stating that he did not think his words were interpreted as an attack on a person.
'I'd like to take the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the female relay,' he said at the CBC Olympics.
'I was talking about a swimmer's performance, not her in person.'
'It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I'm sorry.'
Primark's buyer insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of the store.
Buyers didn't know where to look when some woman was naked to try on her panties on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she tried on what she looked like in them, grabbed them and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Falxton.
Primark shop at the Bouverie Place mall in Falxton, where a woman tried on tricotous panties before putting them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson's mother, who was at the store at the time, said that after putting on her underwear, the mystery woman again "dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the storeroom, she took a couple of panties off the window, took off her own tights and panties and put them on.
"She didn't try to find somewhere private to do it -- she just stood there, shameless."
"Everybody was staring when she took her panties off again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing to three other couples before she finally decided there was nothing here that she liked, dressed again and came out.
"It doesn't look like she cared who was watching her or what she thought of the person who would eventually buy those panties she was trying on."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "It's disgusting to think someone's going to take home the underwear someone else's already worn, and they weren't washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these clothing items from the market after she left -- much better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's panties and find out that another woman wore them and took them off, and they weren't washed."
Primark said, "Primark knows about an incident that happened at our store in Faulxton on Tuesday, August 9.
All the goods in question have been removed from the market.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks using krav-maga
The outside world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Misrachi, M.A. of the Kraw Maga Federation in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether it comes from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If you come in the back, the first thing Misrachi said is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and 'release the line of fire'.
Then you squeeze the gun firmly between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then a knee in the groin follows, and as the attacker bends in pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, you stab him in the face with a gun, and you walk back with the gun pointed at him.
For an armed man coming from the front, the way you do it is to get your body out of the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and pull it out so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, place the weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before you step back and target him.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video to see exactly how the Mizzards do it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery -- if you're not a master krav-maga -- is to give up your cash.
For the guide, traveler Jan Wright walks his tongue through the dirtiest places in Europe.
The British traveler put his immune system and vomit reflexes to a serious test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The director and author of travel books, Jan Wright, 51 years old, from Suffolk, spoke the euro note, the Tsirk Piccadili rails, the flushing of toilets on the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used the luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is going to be a movie called "The Guide of the Traveler-Lizun to the Inner Force," has produced some amazing results.
The idea of licking a flush button on a train used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his tour of Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and medical staff about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the licks brought him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known through tests on his bowel strength, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public rails at the train stations to the toilet flush button, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he made, he said, 'I've been completely carefree of my health since I was a kid, and I pulled a lot of things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test swab showed a luminometer value greater than 4,000 units.
In comparison, the hands just washed should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after its luminometer value was over 4,000, while the newly washed hands show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio made a movie about a traveler called "Traveller-Lizun's Guide to the Inner Force", which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet.
In the film, he said, 'It's close to one of the worst things I've ever smelled in the bathroom.'
There's nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
"Traveller-Lizun's Guide to the Inner Force" was filmed together with the Finnish dairy manufacturer, Valio.
The company provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains acid-milk bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
The senior vice president of Valio for snacks, juices and new categories, Nico Voorenmaa, said, 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see, and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added, 'Let's just say I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film.'
Naturally, some things were easier to lick, and some were rather harsh.
I'm glad we got some of these licks on tape.'
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of respondents linked acid-milk bacteria exclusively to the good state of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes products containing the added acid-milk bacteria.
The hooligan family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall Municipal House, on the eve of the eviction.
The hooligan family left their municipal home with a loss of 50,000 pounds after being evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were expelled from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing cooperatives found the property in a state of repair.
The walls were left with the gaping holes, the floorboards were opened, the garbage was sprinkled on the floor, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family has now been resettled and is believed to live in a private apartment
Donna McAvoy, the resident at Cornwall Houseing, said she was afraid he couldn't be saved.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are many things to weigh, because this real estate is likely to be known as the not-so-good aspect of Cornwall.
This family is infamous, and its name is infamous.
The couple had three sons who lived in a real estate facility from time to time, and the police reported that the reign of family horror included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents in nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screams, disputes and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms, a house that could be demolished was found with old garbage.
The floorboards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out.
Neighbors say they saw a fight in the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Houseing forced her and her partner to leave the house this week after being granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was welcomed with relief by neighbours who said that their lives had been turned into hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'This morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet, we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the head of the Cornwall Houseing team, said that the family had not been able to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in a house for 20 years, with the police, and they called the police regularly.
Garbage and old toys were scattered down the edge of the municipal house.
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant was unable to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family, as eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Houseing considers.
It was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been terrifying to its observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police, and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done bravely to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to neighbours and send a signal that asocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said that they were all a little over 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the eviction
The resettlement workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that surround the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales, supplies and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he pleaded guilty to possession of Class B drugs for delivery.
She claimed that the money went to pay for a tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were rendered homeless, it is reported that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
Many rooms in the house were covered with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they'll try to evict tenants who don't comply with rent rules.
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall PD, stated that the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to break the rules.
'It's a message to those who feel they can behave without the prosecution's charges, as well as to those who are harmed by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying warplane almost touched the beach.
In the city of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who love to relax in the sun were terrified of their lives.
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew in incredibly low.
Air Force reported that he was on a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk
This is the moment when frightened tourists start panicking, while a low-flying plane matches a crowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost at a distance from the hunters on a strip of sand to Aveiro, northern Portugal.
As soon as they became understandably concerned about the noise of the aircraft’s engines, the resters were on their feet, but were unable to see what was moving toward them through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveiro in Kosta Nova.
Daniel Fernandesh, one of several vacationers who posted a video of a shocking flight on social media, said, "He flew very low twice, and there was a moment, at some point, it seemed like he was going to crash."
Nuno Arroza added, "I surfed, and I swear, it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on the Aveiro beach were horribly frightened when the plane showed up out of fog and flew at extremely low altitudes.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to locate fishing vessels off the coast and was forced to descend so low that it was the only way to check them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft had flown slightly lower than usual due to lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and claimed the lives of four people on Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances — thick fog and smog from the forest fires that made the appearance worse.
The plane was on a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to locate fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASSP system has been compulsory for the general public for over a year, but most of Petersburg's cafes and restaurants have not yet introduced it.
Checks are increasing, and businesses face fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year now, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACSP) - risk analysis and critical control points - are mandatory for food producers and carriers, as well as catering companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Rospetnadzor's business checks for compliance with these standards began in Petersburg in February 2015.
But for the time being, officials only issue fines for certain breaches of the regulations (see List of Documents...).
The failure to comply with the regulations in general would cost the enterprise 600,000 roubles for the first offence and 1 million roubles for the second.
As a system that takes into account and prevents risks in food handling, HASP was introduced in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about food security for astronauts.
The system is now used in all food factories, not only in the US, but also in Canada and the EU.
Since February 2015, HACSP has been operating in TC territory.
Business had four years to develop and implement the system (the demand for HACSP was introduced in the TC Regulation in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of the rule.
Unfortunately, we had long been convinced that the rule applied only to food production and not to restaurant workers, as explained by the head of the Elena Cereteli Public Council.
Now everyone's trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August and the beginning of September.
But they're not going to demand much, because their target audience -- families with children -- is already getting ready for school, experts are celebrating.
The Tourist Alliance sent a letter to the Government yesterday asking for permission for charters already.
“For many Russian tourists, the choice of quality and affordable sea holidays is an insoluble issue, since most of the accommodation facilities in the resorts of Krasnodar Krai and the Republic of Crimea have already been booked before the end of September”, the authors point out that the opening of charters in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for Russian marine tourism.
According to the Northwest Regional Office of the Russian Tourin Industry Union (RTA), if the Russian and Turkish aviation agencies agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding as to when the charters will resume does not yet depend primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly build programmes and arrange with airlines for the required ships,” says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the Northwest Regional Office of the RTA.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters was good news, but it would not affect market power, because the main buyers of charter tours, families with children, had already returned from their vacations and were preparing for school or taking vacations in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are bought mostly by single travellers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously," says Pavel Rumyansev.
“Turkey has a chance to attract many tourists if it now offers very budget proposals – 50,000 to 60,000 rubles per trip for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours,” says Valeria Rosenthal, the general director of the Optio-Travel travel agency.
Otherwise, it's certainly not worth counting on -- the bulk of the travel has already been planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be needed, but there is no need to wait.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal of the next season," says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season," Valeria Rubtsov agrees.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from NPFL of statutory compensation payments within the limits of the approved rules relating to compensation for injury or other impairment of health.
Article 222 of the Code provides for the distribution of milk to workers engaged in work with harmful working conditions.
However, the rules and conditions for extradition are established by the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation in its Order No. 45 of 16 February 2009.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other food of equal value is made to workers on the days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful factors in the workplace.
On the basis of the above-mentioned rules, the FN of Russia concluded in the letter under consideration that, on the basis of article 217, paragraph 2, paragraph 3, of the NC of the Russian Federation, income in the form of milk given to workers on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions is exempt from the imposition of the NFL on them, in accordance with the Regulations and the conditions approved by Ministry of Health and Social Development Order No. 45 of 16 February 2009.
The Moscow Gazstroybank was not licensed by the Central Bank.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew its licence to carry out banking operations from the Association Commercial Bank “GASSTRYBANK”, a credit organization registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, GASTROYBANK was implementing a high-risk credit policy involving the placement of money in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a fair reflection of the value of the bank ' s assets have given the credit organization reasons for taking measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in questionable transit operations.
A temporary administration has been appointed in the bank until the date of appointment to a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization are suspended in accordance with federal laws.
GASSTROYBANK is a member of the deposit insurance scheme.
It should be recalled that the payment of insurance compensation to the depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Act No. 177-FZ “On the insurance of the deposits of natural persons in banks of the Russian Federation” is set at 100 per cent of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total per depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will start no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the accounts, the value of the assets of the ACS-GASTROYBANK was 335th in the Russian Federation's banking system as of 1 August 2016.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIL died in Syria
Kadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, was reportedly killed in Syria.
Counsel Tasnim Akunji stated that her family had learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died from a Russian air strike in Raqqa, a stronghold of the group in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was planning to leave a war-torn country and return to England.
“It is only to be hoped that the only advantage of this is as a tombstone and a will to others, that these are precisely the risks involved in going to a war zone to dissuade people from ever making the same choice,” Akunji said.
In February 2015, the Sultan and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reid claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge if elected.
Democratic Leader Harry Reed in the Senate says he is convinced that a democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if elected President.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's claim, the way President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next president will choose the person who can replace the last Supreme Court judge, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said at a conference call on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with a certain degree of confidence."
Representative Reed later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and she was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to rock the boat with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Reed said that the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are the hijackers and supporters of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't right for the job.
"Treats claims that erotic calendars are for "women as well as men."
The "Treats" magazine is working with photographer David Bellmer to release the 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude museums.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of naked models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy, because "Playboy is for men."
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is the same.
"We need to go back to a demonstration of an eternal and classic naked figure where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can provide photographs online or in person in open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moskwich will be given memos about unscrupulous Internet stores.
Moscow is about to issue a memo that will tell you how to avoid becoming a victim of an Internet store.
This was reported in Rospornadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the agency's specialists are preparing a leaflet that will help citizens to choose the Internet store correctly and identify possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of the brochure contains several sections.
It will be general information and a legislative framework, rules of delivery of goods, ways to protect their legitimate rights.
The annex will provide guidance on how to prepare the claim, and so forth”, presented in Rospornadzor.
The memo is currently being finalized.
It will subsequently be posted on Rospornadzor's website in Moscow, and it is planned to produce a printed version and distribute it to Moscow.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement in which it gave the name of the second suspect in the organization of the diversion in Crimea.
Persons from Ukraine and Russia who have assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts have been detained.
Among them were Panov Evgeny Alexandrovich and Zachtej Andrej Romanovich.
"They're all confessing," says the report.
Earlier, a resident of Zaporizhia province, Yevgeny Panov, who had been detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, pleaded guilty during interrogation.
FAS will fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) imposed an administrative fine of 438 million roubles on Google Corporation, which is reported on the agency's website.
"The Google fine for violation of the antimonopoly law was 438 million roubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine soon,” Aleksei Docenko, Deputy Head of FAS, said.
In the course of the investigation, FAS found that Google supplied smartphone manufacturers sold on Russian territory with a Google Play application store only on condition that other corporate applications were installed on the device.
Among these applications is a search engine to be installed on the main smartphone screen.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of the Competition Protection Act (abuse of dominance).
We are confident that the enforcement of the regulation will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will benefit our consumers.
The Law on the Protection of Competition must be observed by all companies whose products are imported into the territory of the Russian Federation and by transnational corporations, among others,” the head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Authority of the Russian Federation, Elena Zaeva, noted.
The agency suspects 16 Russian shops.
The New Books Network was fined for selling the book "50 Days Before My Suicide."
The New Bookshop Network is fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 Days Before My Suicide," reports the Moscow City News Agency.
As reported in Rospetnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book may be regarded as “provoking or motivating the suicidal behaviour of children and adolescents”.
The Court of the Remand of the District confirmed the violation of the prescribed requirements for the distribution of information products to children and ordered the imposition of a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of the printed matter seized by the Rospornadzor Administration.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it was Stace Kramer's work.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow were being tested for 50 days before my suicide.
There's an evening in Moscow to commemorate Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow, there will be a sculptor-sculptor-sculptor Ernst John Doe's evening, reported by TASS.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Letters.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the John Doe personally in the United States.
So it was decided to arrange this evening for those who want to remember him on their own land,” said the Russian Jewish Congress Press Service.
They said it was important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown were invited to the evening, including the poet Yevgeny Evtushenko, the artist Boris Messererer, the President of the Pushkin Irina Antonov GMI, director Mark Rosovsky, as well as Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinski, head of the Moscow Department of Culture Alexander Kibowski, deputy mayor Leonid Pchetnikov of Moscow.
Previously, it was reported that the relatives of Ernst Unknown were planning a memorial service in New York City, presumably before 14 August.
End user of vinyl: Who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men love vinyl.
And while you haven't slammed the comment section with gross insults under the pseudonym of Not All Men Middle Summer, this statement is based on factual evidence.
According to YouGov, so much of the renaissance discussed is not due to a boom among a generation of 2,000 who want to enter a new material subject, but to the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high probability are between 45 and 54 years old, according to data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It is also not just an act of gathering amateurs; it has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to hold their feelings (56% versus 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% versus 66%).
But are the YouTube results correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking down the middle of the busy Soho Street, wearing a modest gray suit and gesturing around before the stop, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, "Okay, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho’s heart is slowly losing its charm and dirt — hotels, cafes, Papershase shops have now flooded buildings once occupied by independent vendors — several music stores with fantastic specialists remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these stores and trying to assess their age and emotional attitude through observation.
A native of Glasgow Stewart, 55 years old, who followed me from Sister Ray (two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reccles Records (eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20 years old), in London for half a day to meet, and walks shopping to take a few hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I suppose so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, shown above (he e-mailed me a picture, I didn't follow him home) are lined up the walls of his living room.
His reason for buying so many albums and singles is partly derived from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn't afford when they first came out and buy back the items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many of what I'm buying is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my fault.
Wes, 25 years old, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouTube profile.
He noticed, however, a new wave of people influenced by media noise, people who heard about their return and felt the obligation to buy back their old records.
From the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says.
This may explain the boom in the vinyl renaissance of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of records?
It takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wes, some older clients, in particular, are insulted by the cash-free pay system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel the shock of the digital world and prefer to retreat into the constant existence of familiar vinyl envelopes, objects that awaken memories of a serenityful youth.
"I think sometimes it could be filling a void or possessing material things as a sort of calm," Wes says.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's a simple way to keep your head occupied.
"We're their social workers!" said a colleague from the record stack.
A survey by ICM in April showed that almost 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% had a record player that they never used, while 7% of those who buy vinyl had no record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled by stylizing the Bosanov collections.
The "Trofayal" aspect of regeneration is what Johnny, 42 years old, observed working at Sounds of the Universe.
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it in the shelf," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More of a piece, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not old people, just under 20 who are just getting to know it.
Fopp, who's now taking almost the entire floor of the vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples over 70, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores — the last Synth and Sexy Pop Wild Best, not jazz improvisation — it is nice to see the diversity of its clients.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to establish a painful psychological trauma standing around someone for 30 seconds.
Eleanor, 27, walked through Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available on the market.
She's looking at the goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make a lot of money, she says, so picking up records isn't a good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of the vinyl is..." - it plunges into dreams with a sigh of love.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop is the store, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: the city fashions.
While I'm creating the illusion that I'm looking at denim tight shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gather around Polaroid's camera every minute before dad and his daughter start talking about buying Crosley's player.
On the left is a ladder with a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mack: a mix of modern style and classics, compulsory records for any medium collection.
No one is looking — perhaps because they are just ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real art vinyl.
But, given that any focus on these items could mean more money to the industry and send a few clients to Soho's depths for a while, there's hardly anything to complain about.
Not surprisingly, a segment of the population that is more likely than most people to have more time and money than most people have is the one that spends most of the money on luxury goods like vinyl.
But as long as my findings indicate that YouTube results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they do not rule out the existence of a huge number of women collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or offices.
But they obviously don't spend the morning of Thursday walking through record stores on Berwick Street, scrolling records and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake host who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland Polar Shark — The Longest Living Vertebral Animal — A Video Report
Scientists claim that the Greenlandic polar shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, claims that the record set a female between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long.
The French court has rejected the proposal to demolish shops in the Jungley refugee camp.
The French court rejected the Kale authorities ' offer to demolish dozens of homemade shops and restaurants in the Jungley camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At this week ' s court hearings, Kale authorities stated that the State should be able to demolish a total of 72 homemade shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer a haircut or sell tea for 50 cents (40r) or simple meals for several euros in homemade restaurants.
Prefecture Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and health risks.
Humanitarian teams told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, claiming that free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for a growing population in the camp.
They said that home stores and restaurants often provided shelter and free food to those in need.
Lille's court held that there was no legal basis to expel people running 72 homemade shops, but stated that the problems of Kale Prefecture were “fully understandable”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the role of grocery stores, cafes and restaurants was much greater than merely feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions”.
He said that the spaces were safe places for refugees and volunteers to meet.
One of the places that was threatened with demolition was the children ' s cafe of the Jungle Book at the camp, which works for no profit and offers 200 meals per day, English and French classes and counselling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect a children's cafe.
The letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not older than eight years of age."
Two charities, Aid to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungley camp had increased to over 9,000 — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Neighbourhood libraries invite young free people to study programmes.
This week, the branch libraries will hold meetings to celebrate City Day, the Year of Russian Films, and even the Day of Physical Education.
The programs are child-friendly, so most of them will be in play form.
Today, August 10, the branch library No. 2, in a polynomial neighborhood, invites to a cruise presentation of "My City is Small".
On August 11th, at the library headquarters No. 1, it'll be a provincial hour, "I live in this city, I know this city."
There will be a multimedia lesson on the same day in the Library-Library No. 2.
And in Librarian Library No. 4 in Surazevka, there's a game program called "Film, Film, Film."
On Sunday, August 14, for the kids from the northern neighborhood, the branch library No. 3 will run a game program called "Fizcult Hello!".
Britain stops at silver in rugby-7 after Fiji's master class allows them to take gold.
An impressive episode of the UK in Regby 7 was severely stopped at the final obstruction by the Fiji team in the finals on Thursday evening, when they were completely defeated at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji was given a master class in ball ownership, plowing, evasion, game support, line runs and brute force to win gold, their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat came with the not-too-poor solace of silver — Britain’s third in a day — and they could be proud of their efforts at the first rugby 7 Olympic tournament, in which New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa were defeated along the way.
The Boks 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier that day could have returned to have a negative impact on them in the finals.
But, no matter what, Fiji won the best team of 15 in this form.
This may be some consolation for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British will put a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach, Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon.
It was a trip for the UK.
Eight years ago, on Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
These blows will hurt, but progress is remarkable.
Fiji started out great, fighting back Britain's attempts to catch the ball for fun.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osei Colinisau dived into the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank, which was realized.
12.0 and the UK barely touched the ball.
A magnificent attempt to intercept Mitchell prevented Mount Leon Nakarawa from beating the third, but it only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another one after the resumption, and there was still more than a minute on the clock... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through a few more sluggish attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
The implementation led to a 29-0 break.
It looked like Fiji was born to play rugby-7, while Britain was still in possession of the craft.
Which, to a large extent, is true.
Britain was making mass replacements for half the game, and they blocked the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton took an attempt for the UK, making a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game long ago followed the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags, and danced on the podiums.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji’s full joy at its approach.
Mata William decorated a Fijian cake that didn't need embellishment, another attempt in the last few seconds.
There was a whistle, Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-finals, and Britain slightly bypassed South Africa in a tense semi-final of one attempt each, the difference between British implementation.
Kyle Brown takes the Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great legwork, tore the line and tore the line under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, 15th brother to England's team, Anthony, secured a victory — and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the rowing coach's battle with cancer.
There won't be any more exciting gold in these games, and that points to something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy climbs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional meanings for their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in the boat, the echo of Coach Robin Williams was always as long as they sought second-round Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sports to reach that height.
Their superiority was absolute, and in the end it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant athletes, sliding on the surface with swan elegance, do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind each gold was a battalion of ready-made hands, contributing to gradually increasing victories that mattered, and there were no hands that were more important than the hands of the coach, who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live to see the day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
This could be a pretty bad situation.
She's changing your outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014 in the off-season, keeping the break in schedule minimal if it could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed payment, so I needed to recover quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital walking around the office -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said there were enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The ridge itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
The moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, captain of the artillery regiment, with a service in Afghanistan behind her back, said, "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
It's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank him very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner to practice or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
This couple sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even at the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark's teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much to spare.
We were in a lot of phase.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's very important not to get carried away right now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to row and get out and win this race, which we did.
It's gonna take a couple a year to figure out their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, her own with Steve Becksholt's adventurer.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government has extended the destruction of the sanctions products
The Government has extended until the end of 2017 the destruction of food prohibited from entering Russia.
The decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in August 2014.
The ban has since been extended several times, now in force until December 31, 2017.
It is prohibited to import certain agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the countries of the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products have been banned.
The disposal of food imported in violation of the embargo has been under way in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were seized from sale.
Hunting the "prohibited"
Rains and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region that will bring precipitation and lower air temperatures.
The air will warm up to 25 degrees of heat in the afternoon.
For example, on Saturday night in Moscow, there will be short-term rains, storms and gusts of up to 15 m/s.
Rain is expected during the day with thunderstorms and gusts of up to 12-17 m/s.
Rainstorms are also predicted in Orlov, Kursk and Voronezh oblasts, reported to Day.
Next week's work week, the rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO Panel of Arbitrators found Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil to be contrary to the rules of the organization.
Import rates are higher than Russia's accession commitments to WTO.
“This is the first time the WTO has made a decision against the Russian Federation”, says the report on the organization's official website.
However, the arbitrators emphasized in their opinion that the EU had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures were “systematic” or “comprehensive”.
Russia, for its part, has promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is mentioned in the report of the Russian Ministry of Development.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which had imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, Financial Times wrote that U.S. conduct in resolving disputes in the WTO undermined the organization’s principles of discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of the Americans to approve South Korean Judge Jang Song Hwa for a second term.
Therefore, Russia will not address the WTO on the question of Western sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined in 2012.
In the President's administration, there's been a change of leader.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed former Deputy Sergey Ivanov Anton Vino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin reshuffled the President's administration and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
Anton Wino, in turn, stated during the meeting that he considered the anti-corruption work that he had begun as President Ivanov's head of administration to be important and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, Izvetia had written that experts considered the situation of Sergei Ivanov's resignation as head of the administration to be transparent and understandable, and that the reshuffle would not fundamentally change the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader, who served for a long time in the President ' s administration, has left, has effectively built up the activities of the AP.
He was replaced by the deputy chief of administration, Anton Wino, a man who is well aware of the specifics of this work.
In Poland, it is accepted that they will not purchase fuel from Gazprom.
The State-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it as a result of a shift towards fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Boguslav Majec.
His words are conveyed by TASS.
"Maybe we're not going to buy gas at all, "from Gazprom, "we're diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, our main supply lines will be the East, LNG terminal raw materials and Norway,” Majec said.
Gazprom currently dominates the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that a Russian supplier had supplied nearly 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, 30 per cent higher than in 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG procurement rose to 49.8 per cent, compared with 40 per cent a year earlier.
It will be recalled that on 22 July Poland's anti-monopoly agency did not agree on the establishment of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners in the construction of the Northern Flux-2 gas pipeline.
Poland, however, had earlier this month left Gazprom's request for 11 billion cubic metres of gas on “Northstream 2”.
This was stated by Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Holding Board.
The Northern Flux 2 auction will take place in 2017, and an auction is scheduled to take place in autumn 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom was not yet planning to take any action on the Polish side's intention to abandon long-term gas contracts from Russia after 2022, and was announced by Alexander Medvedev, Vice-Chairman of the Board of the Company.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, Poles had only increased the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation by 42 per cent.
Gazprom added that the mere fact that the Polish PGNIG had filed an application with the Stockholm Arbitration Tribunal did not yet mean that the negotiations had been terminated.
Previously, a Polish company had applied to a court in order to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall that the Polish Government's Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, Peter Naimsky, the Polish Government’s Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, stated that his country could stop supplying blue fuel from the east in six years’ time.
He said that Warsaw planned to build a new liquid natural gas supply terminal, Baltic Pipe, which would connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
The “Northern Flux-2” provides for the construction of two sea pipeline threads with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the Baltic Sea floor.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMS) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine ' s border with Crimea.
This was reported by Alexander Hug, the first SMM chapter in Ukraine.
“I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this field,” he said, responding to a question from journalists, transmits to RIA News.
According to OSCE, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm, and there are no security incidents.
Observers monitored three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a Yak-42 passenger plane landing at Ufa airport appeared on the Network, which rolled out of the runway by 400 metres and landed on the left wing.
The video was released on Channel 360.
The emergency occurred at 4:30 Moscow time.
Krasavia Flight has arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to safety, no casualties.
The aircraft itself was being transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport is running normally.
The Volga Department of Investigation in Transport has been investigating the reasons for the heavy landing of the plane.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stephen de Mistura, considers the fact to be undeniable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, which are scheduled to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have initiated investigations into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on the toxic gas attack, suspected chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that, in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, the aircraft dropped the poison bombs, but in Moscow the charges were described as a drop.
The Russian Ministry of Defence later accused the opposition group Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zinki of what had happened.
It soon became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I smelled gas, I started to burn my eyes, it was hard to breathe," quotes the account of the eyewitness.
At least 7 people were killed in the attack and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be considered a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told journalists, "The evidence that this really happened is a lot."
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is prescribed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict have denied the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of chlorine used by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the daily shelling of its areas and by the terrorists ' obstruction of the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current three-hour daily quiet regime in the organization is considered “not sufficient to help the nearly 2 million civilians trapped”.
The Humanitarian Adviser, Staffan de Mistura, Jan Egeland, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required each week to bring the sick and wounded to the city.
“We have to send bulk cargo from a convoy of trucks to an area where the roads are virtually destroyed and those left are mined”, Mr. Egeland said.
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” are continuing.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle over Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, on 11 August announced a three-hour cessation of hostilities regime, which will be in effect every day starting Thursday.
The creation of humanitarian windows is intended to enable the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow to halt the military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
Four people were killed in a series of explosions at Thai resorts.
Just a few explosions went off in the south of Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed and 19 injured in the attack.
The explosion's epicenter came to Hua-Hin.
Ten foreigners, nationals of four States, were among the victims, and there were no Russians among them.
No terrorist groups have yet claimed responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs has hastened to state that Islamists are not involved.
Several persons have already been detained on suspicion of causing explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military in charge of the country.
Attacks occurred at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in Phuket and Hua Hing, Trang and Surat Tani.
Following the assumption of power by the military junta in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been apprehended, as reported by police colonel Crisana Patanacharoin.
He added that it was too early to talk about the goals, but that the Ministry of Internal Affairs was “confident that they were not linked to international extremist groups”.
It's too soon to draw conclusions, Mr. Patanacharoin said.
But we know for a fact that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are actually local sabotages, and we're trying to identify those behind them.
The bombings took place on the birthday of Queen Sicrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to Police General Sithichai Srisopacharoinrat, the bombs were detonated remotely within half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with restaurant dinner tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who sold street food.
The identities of the remaining victims were not yet known, but they were known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, four of them are German citizens, three are Dutch nationals, two are Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
Russians are not among the victims of the explosions, as reported by the press service of Rosturism.
Local experts have also linked the explosions to the referendum held on 7 August, in which 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution-making commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters needed to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper house of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role in the election of the country ' s Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the parliamentary elections of 2017.
It will be recalled that on 22 May 2014, Thailand experienced a military coup led by the country ' s army commander, Prayat Chan-Ocha.
He said that the army had led to an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, and dispersed the protesters and the upper house of Parliament.
How Bangkok was in a State of Emergency
The Thai Government, led by Premier Yinglak Chinawat, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
It's like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions took place in the centre of Bangkok at the Victory Monument, where a major protest took place, in which 28 people were injured, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions were caused by unknowns on motorcycles.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and engaged military forces to protect the demonstrators.
The development of conditions has begun in Dry Loga.
As IA has become known, the Government has been asked to agree on draft terms of reference for the Dry Log goldfield auction, with two key limitations remaining.
It is proposed that companies with 25 per cent or more of foreign ownership and those with no minimum 25 per cent of public participation be excluded from the auction.
The industry does not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are no longer at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction could be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature has submitted to the Government a draft order and terms of auction for the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, Dry Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), and has shared two sources of IO that are familiar with the situation.
The draft was introduced on Wednesday evening, with a clarification of one of them.
I.E.D. confirmed I.A. that the project was in the government.
Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Hloponin's supervisor said "IOI" that the project has not yet entered the office.
“An auction may be announced as early as August, immediately after the issuance of the Government's order, and in view of the deadline for the collection of bids by potential bidders (at least 45 days), a tender may be held as early as October”, they say at the Ministry of Nature.
According to IA, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as set out in the version that was sent to ministries and FOIVA in July (iA).
The first is the presence in the capital of applicants of at least 25 per cent of the State's participation.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investments in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the draft, FZ, as IE had already written on 2 August, may exclude from the auction companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, since Dry Log is of federal importance (over 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Environmental Protection confirmed that the project “has restrictions on the admission of foreign companies” but refused to comment on the details before the government order.
The demand for State participation in the auction was raised by the Irkutsk region, said "I" in December 2015 at the Ministry of Nature and later confirmed by the Governor of the Region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor, Sergei Eroshchenko, “with investment agreements with Rostekh”.
Those who lobbied for the alien admission limit don't say "I" exactly.
"But it's in the spirit of time: not to give up control of Russia's largest gold deposit against the backdrop of Western sanctions," says the interlocutor, who is familiar with the preparation of the auction.
On 1 August, the head of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Sergei Donska, stated that foreigners “may join a consortium” if the applicants involved them “as financial entities, technology partners”.
IA interviewers don't think it's likely that the government will adjust the terms.
A consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation, Polus, controlled by Suleiman Kerimov's son Said, and Rostech, are considered the main contender in Dry Log in the industry.
As IE wrote, in July, the partners created the SL Gold SP, where the Pole has 51% shares, and RT-G has 49%.
In Rostech, they refused to comment, and the Pole said "I" that "of course, they're interested in this asset" and they have all the necessary competences and resources to develop it.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the conditions have been announced," added the Pole.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the Russian government's decision was said to be "I".
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops assets on Chukotka, claimed to be able to participate in the development of Dry Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to IA, are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, Russian gold union leader Sergei Kashuba estimated "I" investment in Dry Log at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants deter not only the level of investment, but also the complexity of the project: there is a need for serious intelligence of stocks and complex ore technology, explaining IO interlocutors in the industry.
In the pension market, the largest M&A deal, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, started the process of bringing together the four NPFs under its control.
As a result, the National Fund for Pension Savings will be established on the basis of the Gas Fund, with savings of about 373 billion roubles.
The commencement of the merger of four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promgrofund, Heritage and Gaz Fund Pension Savings - was reported yesterday by the owner of 100% of the KIT Finance Pension Administrator's funds.
“Reorganization shall be carried out in agreement with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement that the terms of the contracts in force shall not deteriorate”, states the company's report.
The merger is conducted on the basis of the Pension Savings Gas Fund.
As the NPF CEO, Oleg Bialoshitzky, notes, the pooling of funds has several objectives: to expand the geographical presence, to concentrate resources for development, to reduce costs, to replicate the best practices of each of the foundations and to optimize corporate governance.
He said that the target date for the completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the GPF, the Gas Fund for Pension Savings will be the largest player in the GPF market.
As at 31 March, the pension savings of the pooled funds exceeded 373 billion roubles.
According to the accounts on the foundation's website, the beneficiaries of their owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently Anatoli Gavrilenko (65 per cent owned by the DOS) and the Gazfund NPF (35 per cent).
However, the group itself launched the competitors much later.
For example, NPF Future's O1 group absorbed Stahlfund early this year.
This joint NPF is currently joining Uralsib and the Russian Standard.
“Uniting in a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to meet structural challenges”, notes NPF’s “Future” CEO Nikolai Sidorov.
Since April, active fund consolidation has also been taking place in the Safmar-European, Education and Science and Regional Fund pension group, which is expected to join the Safmar-NPF before the end of the year.
In 2017, they will be joined by the NPF Trust.
“The pool of funds will have the effect of enhancing control over risks, transaction processes and costs”, noted the Safmar Pension Group.
The pause in the pool of funds sustained by KIT Finance Pension Administrator may be due to several reasons, as indicated by the experts.
Until recently, the NPF could not buy more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure bonds to which the group was heavily placed.
Since the amendments to the SC Regulation in March this year, there are no further restrictions on a number of issuers meeting the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, one major player can buy the entire issue," pointed AKRA’s financial rating group director Yuri Nogin.
Several NPF leaders from the top 15 assets list another possible reason for the pause is the separation of spheres of influence and, as a consequence, the staffing assignments in a single fund that the owners of the group had to agree upon.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
There was no response to an "I" call from the Gazfund NPF either.
While the consolidation of funds is a time-consuming and costly exercise, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
As the CEO of the Pension Partner Consulting Company, Sergei Ocolesnov, notes, the Gas Fund for Pension Savings has fewer outflows, and accession will stabilize the base of other group funds.
In doing so, the NPF KIT Finance and Promgrofund will require better experience in the construction of retail sales of TSOs, as well as the use of more modern software.
The CB requirements for NPF processes and personnel are constantly increasing, so it is not appropriate to duplicate infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, according to Pavel Mitrophanov, Managing Director for Corporate Ratings “Expert RA”.
“The effect of reducing duplicative functions will clearly close down the potential costs of integration,” notes Mr. Mitrophanov.
The cost of merging the four funds is estimated at 30-50 million roubles.
“The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million roubles a year, with the budget being effectively halved in the medium term,” I am sure.
A good Disney movie, Pete and His Dragon, was released in Russia.
New Zealand’s beautiful species, a comforting dragon, a soul-pushing story, and country-style songs are enough to believe in old - fashioned magic again, says Elena CRAWTSUN.
A frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human baby and a gentle babysitter, and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot, after the fairy tale puppy, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in his arms.
Six years later, he was thrown into a loin band, no longer distinguishable from the other clever forest raven, Mowgli.
In this way, Pete discovers the redheaded woman of Grace (Brace Dallas Howard), while Gavin's crew (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively running the forest.
Now she's not only gonna have to believe in the existence of the dragon, she's gonna have to help save it.
Pete's taking an accelerated "be human" course surrounded by idyllic Americans wearing cowboy shirts, a moral code in the heart and smiling more dazzling than any commercial.
No character looks or acts too bad to really hate or be afraid of.
Even Gavin, who discovered the hunt for an atypical forester, is far from an irreparable villain.
A huge fuzzy dragon, too, came out of a very fine, good-looking bulldozer, wing-wide airplane, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon makes fun, purring, even grinding, and fortunately does not speak, but it always wants to be petted, so it's advantageously different from all the known cinematographic dragons.
Elliott’s visual image and manner of dealing with it provide such a high degree of emotional engagement that at the most intense moments, not only small viewers but also adults begin to weep desperately in three streams.
Amazingly good, too, young Oaks Figley as Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford is virtuoso giving up a canonical grandfather who would be happy to have every single child.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastic remake of a forgotten 1977 Disney film, Dracon Pete, mediocre from the nose to the tip of the tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and a game movie, and make it the most emotional film this summer?
It wasn't a miracle that helped.
In his painting, Lowry, from the original, took only two things: orphan Pete and the dragon.
There's music numbers and most of the weird jokes on the side.
This good story reads features taken from "Bamby", "Alien" and many other sweet children's hearts.
Disney continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes in the 21st century.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon isn't as amazing as the book of the jungle, and it doesn't have the skillful villain that Kate Blanchett turned out to be as stepmother in the new "Cinderella."
But this naive film is no less successful in believing in miracles and goodness in the best Disney tradition.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magic castle, director Lowry, will get another one for the artistic adaptation of the story of Peter Pan.

RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged with a new offence
The lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing extremist activities, stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had found shortcomings in their client ' s case.
The fact that the D.A.'s office made such a statement was revealed to us just yesterday by the investigators.
We were scheduled to take part in a court hearing on the issue of restricting access to the criminal case file, but the meeting ended up not taking place, and the investigators informed us of the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office,” RBC quotes lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had pointed out to the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the materials collected were not consistent.
The investigators will now have to fill the evidentiary gaps and bring a new indictment against Alexandra Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) appears in the case or will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze explains.
Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015, according to IE.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation had removed from the charge the RBC journalist the phrases “the breakdown of the political situation towards instability” and “the overthrow of power through illegal means”.
The correspondent for Kommersantboscossport, ALEXANDRE ZILBERT, spent his life in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, had lunch in the local dining room, and even passed the WADA test.
Life doesn't seem to stop here for a second.
Even at night.
The final starts are sometimes completed at midnight, after which the athletes will need an hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, resettlement and eviction from the village are carried out without interruption, as some athletes finish their speeches and leave Brazil, while others only arrive here.
At 7:30 in the morning, heads of all Olympic delegations are drawn into one of the temporary tents.
At these gatherings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues,” Igor Kazikov, head of the Russian Olympic team sports delegation, says.
Hot water problems, sorry, toilets.
We fought a long time for purity.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cliners started coming, but they just pop some stuff on the floor, and that's it.
They have, you see, some innovative floors.
Like, you can't wash them like a human being.
We know these floors-- laminates!
Anyway, we've got a change in the cleaning company, and now it's OK.
The Olympiad village is a southern Butovo, a sleeping area surrounded by mountains on the one hand, an impressive moat of water on the other.
And for safety, there's still a two-metre iron fence all around the perimeter, along which there's automatics.
In total, up to 17,000 people can be accommodated in 3,604 apartments located in 31 homes.
On one of the 18-story buildings, there's a huge Russian flag-- this house is completely for our team.
By looking at a small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine which problems seem to be most pressing for the domestic team.
There are two announcements at the registration counter: "Please don't throw paper in the toilet!" and "I'll give you badges.
The bar itself drowns in the booklets.
Their funny color contrasts with the headlines of the brochures: “Infectious disease note for travellers to Rio de Janeiro”, “First aid for drowning, foreign body in the airway, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiovascular resuscitation”, “First aid for burns, heat shock, fractures and bleeding”.
The text inside is kind of encouraging.
For example, “infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
However, not all will have a favourable outcome.
Of course, there is a medical centre in the Russian team, which is ready to provide qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massages, to the residents of the house at any time.
Opposite the health centre is the very headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspirational poster, "No matter what, we'll win!"
And, of course, the poems:
All arguments are bullshit!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let the least of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And in order to raise the spirit even more, there is an announcement: "Dear brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and of all Ruth Kirill, the spiritual care of the athletes of Russia's Olympic team is exercised by the protojeres, Andrey Vladimirovich Kareniev.
You can order a molebean and other bets on the phone...
In fact, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious rites for all denominations in the village.
Well, Russians, in a privileged position, they have their own chapel.
Because of the elevator load from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs recommended for use during the fire.
And in the dark, he tripped over the bodies on her.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of a new cleaning company.
I think they're ready to throw themselves at the washing of the innovative genders at any time, and they've decided to have a quiet hour right on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with a longtime acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our Batutists, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, the champion of Europe, Jan Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
There's nothing to complain about, but Russia's well-deserved coach shares his impressions.
It's one for four, but it's wide.
The closet is funny, of course, and it's not trusting, but it's something you can put in.
"No, you're just playing, they're out of tea." Svetlan Kuznetsov, a tennis player I met in the main dining room, is doing it with her hands.
It's called the main one because it's 2,700 square metres and it's ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
They give 60,000 meals a day for free.
The menu options are: Best from Brazil, Kitchens of the World, Asian foods and Pizza, pasta products.
The last version, as I've seen, is very popular with our volleyball players.
So, let's just say I didn't find soup in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
I'm surprised at Kuznetsov's soup.
It's a good thing I brought Chinese with me.
And a kettle.
But just so you know, we've got worse food on the corts.
At least there's something you can choose, even though you can't stand the uniformity.
I personally picked a cod for a pair and meatballs in tomato sauce.
A sign is placed next to each dish in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, indicating the food value of the product and the presence of allergens.
Well, I'll tell you, it was edible.
I don't even know why that line is always in the local McDonald's.
Satisfied, relaxed, you can say "heaty" athletes on the way out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, the representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're baiting you with a Victorian who gets the winner a T-shirt.
Inflammatory, you might say!
To get a gift, you have to answer at least eight questions out of ten properly.
- I was attacked by a WADA girl.
But I did the wrong one.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic rush, of course.
The situation has become more acute on the second question: “If I have received a notification of doping control, do I have to go to the doping control point immediately?”
I stopped at option B, "No, I have one hour."
I lost my guard, so to speak.
I forgot that you can't expect any relief from WADA.
Anyway, we have to report immediately.
And in the seventh phase of the quiz, my position became quite critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I find it difficult to maintain a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and by the way, it's hard for me) I could use bio-addresses to get "additional nutrients to increase my productivity."
No, they won't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not categorically prohibited, but strongly discouraged in several sentences.
It's not fair playing this WADA!
- What's up, Russia?
There's nowhere to go, behind Efimov, Isinbaev, and all our bloodless crew.
That's why I focused, and I won a poor T-shirt out of my power.
Know ours, as they say!
In a winning mood, I wandered into a fitness center next door.
He's into counting the simulators.
He's down by 250.
He noted with surprise that no Russian sportsman had ever been found in this pile-up of treadmills.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let the man who can't play be trained!
And here's a guy sitting in a nearby clinic.
In line for the eye doctor.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
There's a condom distribution machine in the clinic, just like in the village, where I don't care.
It contains an encouraging call, "Celebrate with the condom."
The only thing left to do is spin the iron that resembles the door lock handle, and the condom made from the natural Amazon latex readily falls out of the machine.
I took one for my memory.
There's no way they're getting 450,000 of them.
The Olympic village has an entire entertainment centre for celebration and celebration.
There's an educational sign in front of him just in case, reminding him that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiard and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange devices that look like videos.
- I'm interested in a fellow Ukrainian team who is actively using a wild toy.
You could have just said that you didn't want to talk to a man in Russia's uniform, that's all.
By the way, there's a strange set of circumstances in my eyes that's squealing from the guys in the billboard.
The most playing team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the village by looking at each of its corners.
But if you walk rather than ride electric cars, you'll have a Canadian team home with a moose at the entrance and a tent with a replacement bathroom, and a ticket office, and a laundry office, and a dry cleaner, and a hairdressing shop, and a flower shop, and a store with everyday items, and a mail with unique stamps (only you can't wait out of Chinese philatelics), and a bank, and a find office, and a photokiosk.
And later in the evening, you will sit in the middle of an olive tree, hung with colorful ribbons, in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who have left this world.
And you'll be on the back of a machine that sprays the fluid to kill insects in a random manner, thinking about eternity.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which in this village doesn't stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was holding its breath, watching the Australians almost punish the American Dream Team, real fans went online.
Few people know: The news that Inna Deriglasova won gold in the rapire at the XXXI Olympic Games was my first.
Maybe I'm the only Moscowman who's ever seen this happen, except for those of course who were watching the Carioca competition that night.
Only a real fan can understand that.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors at the bottom - as always by 1:00 a.m. - wake up and start screaming at each other.
And threatening to move furniture.
There's a crane running in the kitchen - there's no time to go to the market and buy a new one, like the plumber asked.
There's nothing on the television schedule, so I just kept the Match, the First and, in case, the Rossia channel in check, even though it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is the home of repeaters, all the sports are on the record for some reason.
It's live on TV.
The hope, of course, at the Match, was that the young man was shouting in the news bulletins all night, first about the great semifinals of Deriglas-Shanayev, then about the upcoming gold fight.
Makes sense.
But instead, basketball is the U.S.-- Australia.
I can't say anything wrong with that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half won.
They've put in place some great Americans of their own.
As a result, they lost, but, as it is now stated, the Olympic basketball tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but there's a fight with Dee France, and there's no change on the screen.
In a little panic, I'm starting to see the canals.
It feels like it's the second time in a row.
All right, let's go back to the cable.
There's no fencing on any of Matthew's theme sites.
Oh, I feel like the fight's about to start.
Texting and tweeting some sports sites don't suit me.
Sour-road surfing produces an unexpected but brilliant result.
The site “First” turns out to be a live technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at this point in time.
I click on fencing, I get a gold fight.
Deriglasova's doing a great counterattack, goes ahead on glasses, and clearly starts to take her time.
The Italian girl's playing the whole thing out.
Ours is one point ahead, just over two seconds to finish.
Dee Francesca is throwing herself at Deriglasova, she's falling back, time's running out, Italian woman's giving an injection.
Victory!
In a few seconds, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports the fourth gold medal.
So I'm the first one to see it.
Crazy, loyal, involved.
The spiritual administration of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan has refused to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the Plenum of DUM ordered his imams to preach Fridays only in Tatar to force young Tatars to “learn their mother tongue”.
The Directorate states that this does not “in any case infringe” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
Some mosques in Kazan complain that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60 per cent of the parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
The imams fear that their Tartar sermons "will not reach the entire audience."
Yesterday, the plenary of the Duma of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic in Tatar only.
According to the Tarstana Mufti Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their mother tongue”.
“For those who say it's heavy, in every big mosque, we intend to organize the Tartar language lessons entirely free of charge,” Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and today, in all mosques, the sermons “should already be in the Tatar language”.
He recalled that Tatarstan's DUM publishes "Shura" magazine with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
An imam who doesn't speak Tatar enough "can prepare for them thoroughly."
The Tatarstan DUM has more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to the mufti, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language in the districts.
At the same time, in Kazan, Russian was previously the predominant language used in a number of mosques.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was the practice in Burnayev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
Mr. Muhametshin stressed, however, that the goal of the leadership was for all students to speak both the State languages of the Republic, regardless of their nationality.
“No harm can be done to the Nettar Muslims”, Mr. Muhametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself “is not compulsory, the main part of the prayer”.
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, and Russian-language lectures and lessons will be retained in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "I". There was no serious threat that the Tatar language would be removed from mosques.
Apart from Russian and Tatar, other languages such as Uzbek or Tajik are not used in sermons in the Republic, according to him.
The decision of the DMW was actively supported in the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WTC).
Rinat Zakirov, head of the VCT executive, said, "I'm an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tartar language were out of this area.
He pointed out that preaching only in the Tatar language “the wish of the imams themselves”, but in the WCL executive board “considers it right”.
The IYI imams who preached in Russian are willing to implement the decision of the DMM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulties understanding the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
A lot of people don't understand the language.
It's gonna be a little tight for them, of course.
"It will have to be rebuilt," says the Imam of the Burnayev mosque of Farhat Maveletdinov.
According to him, Russian sermons are closer to even many Tatars, because “Russian, in schools and kindergartens, on radio, everywhere in the first place”.
He believed, however, that the mosques would be able to continue with lessons and lectures in Russian, which were held on other days.
In Allah do we put our trust.
He said, ‘Allah will bring a way out of this.’
But about 60% of us don't speak Tatar.
These are Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in Russian for four years," says the imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language, the sermons “will reach a narrower circle and not reach the entire audience”.
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
It's just that the end of the sermon will be different.
But time will tell.
"For example, it will only be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my mother tongue," concluded Gabdullah Galliullin.
Former Director of the Federal Penal Correction Service has been prosecuted.
The Moscow Prosecutor ' s Office confirmed the indictment of the criminal case of misappropriation of the budget allocated to the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service, which was investigated by the SSO.
The former head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, will be brought to trial, causing more than 2.7 billion roubles to the Federal Penal Correction Service.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office sent a criminal case against the former Director of the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service, Alexander Reimer, and his former deputy, Nikolai Kryvolapov, as well as the Director of the Federal Penal Correction Service's “Information Technology and Communication Centre” (FUPC), Victor Vrov, to Zamoskooretskrei court.
Depending on their role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged with committing offences under article 285, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official functions with serious consequences), article 159, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (fraud committed using their official position, as part of an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under article 222, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, between 2010 and 2012, these individuals fraudulently stole from the State Treasury the budget allocated to the Federal Penal Correction Service to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for persons under its control, the so-called electronic bracelets.
For the purpose of misappropriation of budget money, the team developed a scheme according to which the company under its control, the FGP CITES, with which the relevant government contracts were concluded, carried out technical controls and supervision, including “electronic bracelets”, and performed at prices that were several times overestimated.
Despite the fact that the CITES FPU did not have production equipment, buildings and facilities to accommodate the production capacity to create a complete cycle of “electronic bracelets”, five State contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles were concluded between it and the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles were recorded in the accounts of the Samara branch of FGP, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
As a result, Mr. Reimer personally received more than 140 million roubles in cash in his office from an accomplice in criminal proceedings.
Nikolai Kryvolapov, who was involved in the fraud, was found to have an unknown origin of the ammunition for the reward pistol, which allowed him to be charged with additional offences.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the Federal Penal Correction Service filed a claim for damages of 2.7 billion roubles.
Football player Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then of a Member of Parliament, Hakan Shukur, and searched two of his family ' s homes.
The star of Turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s, Hakan Shukur, is wanted by the country's authorities in connection with an attempted coup d'état last month.
Forward, who graduated from sports in 2008, is accused of belonging to an “armed terrorist group”.
This is the Khismet movement, a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious figure and opposition, Fethullah Gulen.
It is its President Erdoğan who considers the attempted military coup of 15 July to be the organizer.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media reports, a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukur was issued today, and the police have already searched two houses belonging to the family of a former football player.
According to the investigation, his father, in addition to Hakan Shukur, was a member of the Fethullah Gulen organization.
However, neither the former footballer nor his loved ones were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a footballer, Hakan Shukur defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and advocated for the country.
He spent most of his career at Galatasarai.
Italian "Torino", "Inter", "Palermo" and English "Blackburn" are on the list of foreign clubs.
He hasn't spent more than one season in any of them, though.
Hakan Shukur is still Turkey's most successful attacker, with 112 matches for the national team and 51 scored.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur resigned due to an ongoing corruption investigation into Erdogan's party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriet, at least 42 journalists were arrested in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and of being associated with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, the media can wait for long prison terms ranging from 10 years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovski wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, which cost tickets two to three times as much as foreign films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovski notes that Russian films find it difficult to compete for an audience with large Hollywood ribbons.
We have more than 100 paintings a year, with an average of 20-25 ribbons reaching our screens.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with the "Transformers" and the "Iron Man" "who are being pushed by huge budgets," said the filmmaker.

INews - The new contractor promises to hand over Zenit Arena by December 26th.
The new general contractor for the stadium under construction in St. Petersburg, which is to host the Confederate Cup 2017 and the World Cup 2018, Metrostroy promises to hand over the arena by 26 December, reports to RIA Novosti, referring to the head of the Interim Commission of the Federation Council for the preparation of the 2018 World Cup.
"Today, with Russian Minister of Sports Vitaly Mutko, we visited the construction site, and we were accompanied by Vadim Alexandrov, CEO of Metrostra.
He said he'd rent out the stadium by December 26th.
It's a serious peterburg company, it never breaks deadlines.
Vitaly Mutko and I were satisfied with what we saw and heard," quotes the interlocutor's agency.
Formerly, Vitaly Mutko arrived in St. Petersburg to inspect the venue of the upcoming large-scale competitions.
Mr. Tülpanov also noted that his commission, Sovfed, would continue to monitor progress in the construction of the stadium and would regularly visit the construction site.
As will be recalled, it was reported yesterday that Metrostray will complete the construction of Zenit Arena, the contract will cost approximately 5.4 billion roubles. The same company has won a tender for the improvement of the area around the stadium, the contract price is 2.4 billion roubles. Contracts with Transtroy Corporation, TransSpb Engineering Corporation and TransStroy Engineering Corporation have been terminated.
Two other companies were not allowed to compete for the stadium.
For more information on the selection of a new contractor, see "I" for "Metrostroroy" in the field.
In Miassa (Chelabina region), the lawyer of former Lieutenant-Governor Nikolai Sandakova Konstantin Akulić was detained.
According to another lawyer for the accused, Sergei Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulić was summoned to the SCR Miass Investigation Department today to charge him with a battery case one year ago.
Konstantin Akulić then went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to assist one of the participants.
“It was initially initiated against unidentified persons, now that he has begun to defend Nikolai Sandakow, it appears that it was Akulić,” Sergei Kolosovsky says.
Konstantin Akulić became a lawyer for the former Deputy Governor in early August.
However, half an hour before the lawyer was summoned to the SCR, the defence party was informed that the deadline for reading the fraud case file against Nikolai Sandakov was due to expire on Monday.
Let us recall that two criminal cases have been brought against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first (fraud case), he is charged with a promise of 1.5 million roubles to promote the appointment of the mayor of Magnitogorsk as head of the administration of Evgeny Tarasov Lake.
The second criminal case concerns a bribe that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from the director of Python PHOP, Igor Kalugin, in the form of illegal, pro bono services of a property nature amounting to at least 1.3 million roubles.
For more information on Mr. Sandakoff's case, read "I" in "The former Lieutenant Governor demands that his affairs be consolidated."
The Russian Copper Company (RCM) is ready to assume social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RCM has undertaken to modernize one of the country's oldest and most environmentally dirty enterprises, the Karabash Copper Smelter.
The Karabash Copper Smelter was founded by an English joint stock company led by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a meaningful industrial enterprise for the economy of the country, and it actually ensured the viability of an entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was halted, causing serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, a decision was taken to reopen the Karabash copper smelter.
It was also necessary to address one of the main problems of the Karabash factory, the environmental one.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already notorious as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation on Karabashmedi began to change in 2004 after the company was taken over by the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, gradually reducing the environmental burden.
The Governor of Chelyabinsk oblast, Boris Dubrovski, also recently noted this, visiting “Carabashmed” in the early months of July.
The head of the South Ural called the huge changes that have taken place with the company since Carabashmede joined the RMC group.
The main modernization activity of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sulfur acid shop, which captures up to 99.9 per cent of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian copper company All-Wald Levin, the investment in the project amounted to about 7 billion roubles.
The next stage of the modernization of the Karabashmedi AZO is the reconstruction of the conversion system.
The replacement of the three converters, the pulverizers and the gas pipeline is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, a new 1 billion roubles industrial waste-water treatment facility is planned for the end of 2016.
In turn, the amount of taxes paid to the city of Karabash will also increase.
During the entire period of the project of the Tominsk GHA, from the start of construction to the start of the second phase, the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
Once the GHP has been put into operation, the collection of taxes at all levels can amount to 80.9 billion roubles.
During the year of production, 346.3 million roubles were transferred to various levels of budgets in the Varnen region.
And that's in the first year.
“The longer the enterprise succeeds, the more the deductions may be,” Valery Ulanovsky added.
In the RCM, it was clarified that in 2015 taxes from the Miheevsk GHK were close to 1 billion roubles.
However, the participation of CMI enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to taxes.
The BMK enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and recreational facilities and the development of areas.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian copper company in Karabash was the major renovation, and in fact the almost complete restructuring of the N9 kindergarten into 95 children.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of emergency.
There will also be a landscape park with an artificial pond, an underground and above-ground parking area with 600 cars, cafes and sports stores.
The Arena RCM will allow for spectacular professional sporting events at the international level.
But the main objective of this project is to make physical education and sports in a comfortable environment accessible to the people of Chelyabinsk, especially children.

A fisherman caught a rare blue lobster off the coast of Cape Cod, U.S.A.
The man found crustaceans among the others caught in his underwater trap, reports ABC News.
The American plans to transfer it to the local aquarium.
Lobster weighs about a kilo.
It is reported that Wayne Nickerson has been fishing lobster for the past 35 years.
According to his wife, for the first time in his career, a man was caught in a blue lobster in 1990.
According to ABC News, crustaceans acquire blue or blue colour as a result of genetic changes.

The Black Sea Navy has been conducting operations on submarine-diversification defence in the Black Sea area.
Igor Dugalo, the spokesman for the Department of the Defense Press Service, reported this to RIA News.
The exercises were conducted during the first phase of the training exercise on special types of support for the operations of the Navy.
“Military personnel of the sub-water-diversification units have worked on the anti-submarine-diversification defence of the naval base of the coast and the surrounding sea area of the Black Sea”, Dugalo clarified.
Some 400 military personnel, more than 10 pieces of military equipment, including MI-8 and K-27 helicopters, Grachonok anti-diversification boats and Raptor patrol boats, participated in the exercise.

The pensioner turned the ladder into a budget beach tower.
Network users laughed at photographs of an elderly man putting a ladder on the beach and turning it into a water jumper.
The photo was published on several entertainment portals, as well as in a group called Moi Taganrog on the VKontakte social network, which led many to believe that the photograph was taken on the shore of the Sea of Azov.
In the comments, "innovation" was called a "budget tower" and a "mobile tram."
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "sneaking" and some pointed out that the man was at serious risk of being injured when jumping from his tower because he had placed it in insufficient depth.
However, one of the commensators on the Pikabu portal noted that it was not possible to judge the depth of the sea from a picture.
"First, we don't know what depth there is, the beach can be a blister with a sudden descent of a meter just behind the stairs, and second, even if there's a meter of depth, with proper skill, you can jump from a few meters," wrote the user under the name C0JIBAMDJZ.
The Italian edition of Roma Today, however, says that a man with a ladder was seen on a beach near Rome.

The owners of Messengers and Post Offices must identify users and remove prohibited information - this is the summary of a draft law developed by the Media and Communication Union (MCS), which unites the largest Russian communications operators (there are “Vedomostis”).
The staff of the three member companies confirmed that such a project was under discussion.
Early in the autumn, it should be presented to a working group led by First Vice-Premier Igor Shuvalov, speaking to an interlocutor of Vedomosti at the ISS.
These include amendments to the Communications and Media Acts.
They provide that any “convenor of the dissemination of information on the Internet allowing the exchange of electronic communications” is obliged to identify users on the basis of the information contained in the databases of the telecommunications operators by pre-contracting them.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation because of the hacking of Democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering new sanctions against Russia in response to the Democratic Party server break-in, writes The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, it is reported that President Barack Obama’s administration will have to formally accuse Russian servers or Russian-backed hackers of attacking them.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia's involvement in the cyber attack.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is the break-in of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database in 2014, for which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was officially responsible.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the imposition of sanctions on those who carry out or promote cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could be used against other countries as well.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be lengthy, writing a publication.
Even if officials have come to the conclusion that the hackers acted with Russia’s support, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before making a decision on disclosure.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It has been previously reported that the Barack Obama administration allows sanctions to be imposed on a State whose hackers have hacked into Democratic Party National Committee servers.
WikiLeaks published electronic correspondence from the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with Russian authorities could be involved in the hack.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles.
The reason for this was the lack of competition in the mobile applications market.
The antimonopoly proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company argued that Google provided smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the pre-establishment of applications from other developers, such as Yandex.
FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused its dominant market position and imposed other applications along with Google Play's store on mobile devices manufacturers.
As a result, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, reporting Alexei Docenko, deputy head of FAS.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FÁS concluded that all companies, including transnational corporations, must comply with the competition law.
Google, in turn, intends first to study the solution and then to decide whether to execute it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service found the company to be in breach of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered the contracts to be adjusted to 18 December.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that despite the fine, they were discussing with Google the possibility of a settlement agreement.
This measure will lead nowhere.
The leading analyst, Mobile Research Group Eldar Murtazin, expressed this view.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would not affect either the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.
He rented an apartment and then stole it for 84,000 rubles.
A 30-year-old robber sold stolen household equipment.

A man told law enforcement that an unknown man had rented an apartment from him.
When the owner visited his home, he found it completely empty: no washing machine, no television, no refrigerator, and no tenant.
The total amount of damage was 84,000 roubles.
The security guards soon followed up on the thief.
It turned out to be a 30-year-old unemployed Volzhan.
The man was arrested and confessed, saying that the stolen property had already been sold.
He will now be held accountable for the theft to the full extent of the law - criminal proceedings have been instituted against the detainee.
This year, the Crimeans will receive a transport tax notification.

The effect of "Anime" Snapchat is criticized as a cartoon of Asians.
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some commentators say that it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat tool allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to frame Roy Liechtenstein.
The lens is a crude, crooked tool that creates more than 30 million adjusted selfies a day.
Any mistakes are quickly becoming well known.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of their faces or promoting white faces as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them slashy eyes, curved teeth, and pudgy cheeks, some critics thought it was a racist cartoon of Asians, the yellow-faced ones.
And they wondered whether these recurring contradictions pointed to the more serious diversity problem of the company.
On Wednesday, messages and the ensuing anger in the reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat announced that they had removed the function.
The company commented that the lens was meant to honor the characters of the anime, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But experts who know about racism have been reminded of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an e-mail from Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about photographs was actively shared, said that the lens was "insulting and at least embarrassing."
She added that "it was hard to argue with the comparison side by side of a very crude cartoon on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced, but highly degrading-faced.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the deways we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- which is more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean that they are more likely to be understood.
When one of Snapchat's lenses created an image that was offensive to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, Katy Zhu, 25-year-old, said, "It's a lot harder to go unnoticed than it used to be."
On Thursday, Zhou, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her account at Snapchat and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believed that racial contradictions were the reason for the lack of diversity in recruitment in Snepchat.
Zhu criticized the predominantly white management of the company, consisting of only men, and ended her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, who is an American of Chinese origin herself, wrote: “They did not have enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people working, but they do not hold positions in which they can speak out safely and openly.”
Other commentators share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its staff, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to the trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to concentrate on underrepresented segments of the population and actively seek to mobilize domestic resources.
For her part, Joo said that she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to tell them they're not going to do that."
The military authorities distorted ISIS intelligence, reporting to the Congressional Commission
Officials from the Central Command of the U.S. Armed Forces have changed their intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground warrant, reporting to the Congressional Commission in a report released on Thursday.
The interim report of the task force established by the Republican Presidents of the House of Representatives Committee on Supreme Court Affairs, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations found “widespread discontent” among Central Command intelligence analysts who claimed that the leaders had been correcting their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Cent, is the main military command in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence documents approved by the Centcom High Command generally provided a more optimistic picture of U.S. anti-terrorist actions than is confirmed by real evidence from the scene, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies," said the news report.
“What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with a false analysis, our military is affected,” said Representative Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Management problems in Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report deals in detail with the shortcomings that arose continuously in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration have ordered the reports to be falsified, he claims that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership forces them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies from the Central Command in Congress were far more optimistic than actual events,” the report reported.
For example, Centcoma’s official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it's certain," said Housewoman Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence team of the U.S. Central Command forged command intelligence documents to minimize the threat posed by ISIL in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional investigation of Centcom intelligence is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party on the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States of America published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centk set up an overly closed procedure for conducting intelligence assessments concerning ISIL and Iraqi security forces”, claims House Member Adam B. Schiff, the chief representative of the Democratic Party on the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, “stamped the production of intelligence documents”, damaged the morale of analysts and “not sufficiently reflects divergent views”.
But Schiff and the Democrats claim they didn't find any evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to match their detentions to "a given or political interpretation."
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Best.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon Chief Inspector, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congressional report while the Chief Inspector's investigation was ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree when interpreting complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence welcome healthy dialogue on these vital topics of national security”.
The impact of the investigation goes beyond the question of whether the American bombing in Iraq and Syria (as is now being claimed by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence) is reaching its goal.
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on Central Command to provide truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis locations.
Criticism of Islamic intelligence repeats the debate that took place more than a decade ago when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article claiming that President George Walker Bush’s administration, because of protests by many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the Islamic intelligence protest.
Last year, according to officials, the Hooker team came to the conclusion that despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes on Islamic State-owned refineries did not lead to a significant deterioration in the terrorist group’s financial situation because it built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then Centcom Commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. wins four times in a row in a women's field hockey game, thus approaching a decisive battle with Britain.
Having once scored three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam opened the account on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's grass hockey team when the Americans defeated the 3-0 Indian team.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says she wouldn't be sure if she would ever do something like that.
"I can't put my mind to it," she said.
I'm not really the kind of person who tracks my goals.
Here's what she knows: the 4-0 American score in the Olympic tournament, and they're competing for the first place in their band with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan's 2-0 loss on Thursday.
The British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams compete for the quarterfinals, and the result of the game will determine who will take first place in their group of six teams and who will take second place.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of rivals from Holland, leaders of another group, a little while after the quarterfinals start playing.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made a noise in their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a hockey club on grass when she was three (her older twin sisters played this sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she didn't qualify for the finals.
Then came 2012, when things didn't work out with her and her teammates.
The following year Coig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything started to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical change," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the productivity we have now.
We've completely changed our minds.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand in a short distance.
India approached the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative.
She made a long passage with a ball down the left side of the field, then the spiral went into the middle and sent the ball to the gate, giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" victory was the first time that Jackie Briggs, a U.S. goalkeeper, missed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She's on fire.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the wildness of the Olympic Games, zen jumps on the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how much time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio appear to be constant and inevitable, a ferocious combination of competition and ambition.
It's like the Olympic fire itself is the burning torch that goes from archer to swimmer, to gymnast, to triathlonist.
You can't turn on a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbors talk in turn at the cafe, and not hear about Simone Bales, Katie Ledeki, or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time member of the Olympic Games, a handsome man with dimples on his cheeks, might well be among the celebrities shown in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-supporting commercials if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic battles for trampoline jumps.
The Olympic Fire does not cover all events in the same way.
Far from the centre, partly in the shadows, are those sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, bow shooting, badminton, Taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, a long reign for him.
But if I may speak timidly in defence of my personal addiction, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on a trampoline.
Although trampoline jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney Games, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed were unaware that they were even associated with Olympic sports.
It could be regional ignorance.
Even though the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won the batoon medals, and their athletes did not go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share male awards, and Chinese and Canadians share female awards.
Don Dong from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumps have an outsider charm, especially because for an unenlightened ear, they are associated with circus college rather than the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a landed enthusiast.
They do have a comical potential — a cartoon glimmer of endless jumps — but also the elegance of gymnastics and water jumps, the two sports they basically combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trumpolín", meaning "trumplin for jumping into water."
The winners jump on a giant trampoline, taking up almost 30 feet in the air, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends, and saltos) before finally landing on their feet.
They are assessed by performance, complexity and flight time, according to the official programme of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most popular Olympic course is ahead.
The medal winners must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to finish, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth in the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the start-up wall, but also, in front of television cameras, another irritating frontier: the world record or the Olympic record.
This obstinate pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical — and it is enough to make even the viewer weep.
But it's, in my opinion, a little exhausting watching the Games.
He gives you a break when you jump on a trampoline.
The Batutist's heading is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless, like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then without effort up again.
And, of course, they're not without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program, there's no crazy rush to finish, no jumps in length, just a wonderful, elegant disappearance of time and gravity.
This is the closest zen Olympic sport to the zen.
Women's qualification competitions, followed by the finals, will be held on Friday afternoon, at 1 p.m. Eastern European time; men's competitions will be held on Saturday, also at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals on the afternoon program starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected that can easily be seen in a common dump.
And if one can achieve greater consciousness only by subjecting male athletes to lustful views and objectivity — as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by male hymnasts from the United States — Dooley is just waiting for his new admired crowd of fans.
"The Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrations demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say that dozens of protesters were fatally wounded during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of division?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong West’s ally with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shocked the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s reaction was brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that dozens of unarmed demonstrators had been shot by police officers.
Video recordings of protests allegedly taken at the end of last year or early this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they were placed against the wall.
The highest United Nations human rights official now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It was always hard to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even harder,” said Rasheed Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The American military and intelligence services have worked closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa has received such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably, even with a new suburban train in Addis Ababa, the capital.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations constantly mention government repression — opposition in the territory of the State was suppressed by the fact that dissidents were effectively silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But that could change.
“If people are constantly repressed and left with no options other than protest, there will be an uprising,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints range from land use to the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the Government party and its allies completely displaced the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are increasing; the struggle for this uncertain, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit unrest and rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings that have been boiling deep for several years are now flared up.
The first one seems to be completely harmless: smartphones.
In the last couple of years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media because cheap smartphones have become commonplace and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government shuts down Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized the protests.
Second, there is greater solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Throughout the centuries, Amhara from predominantly Christian highlands in Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But it's also changing.
“We will act together under one command,” said Mulat Gemel, the leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics, are unfairly dominant in Ethiopia.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have foreseen the danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly skillful in recognizing the first signs of discontent and using intelligence agents to extract data and remove opponents.
“The present regime lacks common sense,” Abdi said, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalen, came out of nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he doesn't have the confidence of the security services under Tigray's control.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said appeared to be elections that the Government had ruined and then forged results.
In the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, albeit in smaller numbers than in recent months, a period of unrest that passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopian leaders for the far-sighted development of infrastructure, such as the new long-distance train and the significant progress made in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the Ethiopian government from increasing its domestic discontent.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondara, the city of Amhara, attacked enterprises belonging to Tigray, and the anti-Tygray hatred on social media is becoming comprehensive.
The analysts claim that the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aerial missions over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose its strength in an already volatile region.
"And it's gonna be hard to walk on that tight rope," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIS was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the last conflict that hit his campaign headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the terrorist group the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to deal with the American people in a reasonable manner.
It also placed his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
After suggesting this at a convention on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his assertion on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton had founded ISIL.
But in a post on Twitter, early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just shakin'.
This post was the exact opposite of a statement made just a day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When Radio Conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the speech, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIL, Republican presidential candidate did not seize the opportunity.
The latest scandal broke out when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy against a background of declining ratings.
Trump and Clinton made competing speeches about the Michigan economy this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to get back to the subject.
Again, using Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s plans would lead to increased taxes, and stated that he thought her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm earlier as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he came across a general criticism, practically suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his remarks, saying, "Of course, I'm joking."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is acceptable in political speech and to take back what he says when necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some messages that find feedback among his fans, watching them act, and then "explaining" them in one or the other direction, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, the communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his remarks and knows they're vague enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening the words for a broad electorate, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days, while his rating continues to decline.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist ranking, published on Friday, showed that Trump is down from Clinton with a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and is at a level in Florida.
Although Trump tends not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has been the focus of much attention in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his faithful allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, however provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most famous deputies, made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview given by CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he says is an acceptable political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true, in the sense that before Obama, ISIL was an almost unknown little organization, he called it a threat-free, completely unfair, and that's why it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most average Republicans claim that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIL to develop as it failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued Twitter to attack the media for despoiling every word he said and prejudiced against him.
He made fun of "poor poor" TV experts trying to solve it, and he said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats have mocked Trump's excuses as an unnecessary confirmation that he's not fit for president.
Once displaced coffeehouse returns to Greenpoint.
The Verb coffee shop was full of cash only in Williamsburg, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of her Bedford Avenue window.
Soup Sheri, which took the place of Verb in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soap.
The locals mourned it as a final loss in a revamped city.
Artist Molly Krabaple tweeted, "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The reborn Verb coffee shop opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar, simple atmosphere.
Plus, coffee's still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verba in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said he'd love to do it.
Rodriguez, 36, left much behind.
Verb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even has chandeliers from the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu presents bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches and provides toppings from capers or fried onions.
There's brown rice.
The coffee shop doesn't serve beer anymore, but now they're making fresh juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said that he had drawn attention to the steady flow of old regulars.
"Many ex-clients were also priced from Williamsburg," he said.
Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients on a recent Sunday.
Oliveira, 34 years old, used to live in Williamsburg and frequented Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized it was the coffee and the atmosphere that was implanted in Verba," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although that day she ordered bathed tea instead of regular ice coffee, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time client, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
He stopped by before work and ordered the same thing all the time.
"At fifteen past eight, every day as clockwork, I came, and my bagel was made for me with oil and all the stuffings," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and put new dishes on the menu.
Rosenthal's still doing a regular order today, but one day he'll change something with bacon, egg or cheese on a bagel with all the stuffing.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended that the soap shop once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sheri suggested making special soap for Verba, using coffee from a cold coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer," Rodriguez said.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved the coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the window to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
There are other benefits to a new place.
The local juice shop plans to spill bottles and sell cold coffee.
There's a possibility that the coffee shop will be attached to a building next door.
For a lot of clients, it's enough that the new Verb will put their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and told him that he was heartbroken when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was coming home.
"How long I've wanted to smell that smell," he confessed.
The depressed food of depression in "The Swamp Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after taking up the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras and Merriland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and pruning pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in food history.
Koua's last book, "Raga in Chinese", was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a rented apartment in the Lower East Side through food in her book "The 97th Street Fruit Garden."
Their new joint work, "The Pilot Meal", to be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
Some of their own cooking solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, simple diner in Flatairon District, which has been operating since 1929, the year of the Exchange crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and an olive sandwich, and Koe, 57, took turkey, mashed potatoes, and vegetable mix.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for a discussion about food in the depression era.
"Rulets were in high demand," Zigelman said.
There was peanut roll, liver roll, bean roll.
They were made of the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to be stretched.
Imagine eating as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe's shriveled.
"It must have been a stone in his stomach," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in the countryside, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans were the ones who sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. The “Float Meal” describes how the country was able to cope with the fact that suddenly it was no longer a country of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult subject for Americans," Koh said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was similarly challenging: mysterious foods such as roulettes and casseroles became basic foods; casserole was “a beautiful way to dispose of the leftovers,” Siegelman observed, because cooks could hide the non-appetite ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
The meat, which for many years has been the basis of American food, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even cooking common sense.
In research for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that era: baked onions, stuffed with peanut butter.
"This supplement to the dinner table was not successful," Koh said.
Siegelman added, "It was very strange."
Peanut butter doesn't match the livered onions at all.
This was typical of many homemade recipes.
More than ever, homemakers — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Economics Bureau, from 1923 to 1943 — managed the country's food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budget makers,” to accept the challenge, and to convert a burde of like rubbed spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"The Swimming Meal" is a feast of curious historical facts.
Particularly spicy stories about the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let's eat pies" attitude.
Publicly praising the simple farm cooking of Iowa during his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he became.
"He liked continental cuisine, like a fish with cucumber sauce," Koh said.
He was practically eating in a gilded dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically disconnected from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't told him to set an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was completely unattractive, and this resulted in the White House "using not only the saddest food in Washington but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked."
Many of the depression-era cooking habits were forgotten as soon as the country was back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Siegelman, and on how science was used in cooking.
As they wrote the book, their husbands said that they had a better understanding of the eating habits of Zigelman’s mother — that she could not throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being careless about food," Koh said.
Siegelman recalls, "She seriously poisoned people."
There was a bad case with the professionals.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe got the dessert they made at home: the pruning dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a pruning mousse," said Siegelman, adding that it was a common technique - to give modest recipes catchy names.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to put a spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe asked for more twice.
In the voice of a confident budget-writer, he said to his wife, "A little ruble walnuts could use it."
Arrest of the perpetrators of the case of mass fighting in the Khovan cemetery extended until 14 November
Until November 14, the Presnaen court remanded the subjects in a case of mass fighting in the Khovan cemetery, granting the relevant request of the investigation.
There are 14 accused persons in the case.
It will be recalled that on 14 May, several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus were subjected to a massive gun fight in Hovansk Cemetery, killing three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev, and a lawyer, co-founder of the public organization Healthy Nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, have been charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by Olga Holodec, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, during a visit to Bryansk province.
We have specific parameters on the extent to which pension increases are needed in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Economists are now taking stock of the half-year, and we will complete this work in the next two to three weeks,” quotes Interfax, the Hungry Man.
Commenting on the proposal by the head of the Strategic Development Centre, Alexey Kudrin, to raise the retirement age by six months each year, the Vice-Premier reported that the issue was not addressed in the Kabmin.
At the end of July, it was reported that the Government had agreed on a full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan entered the finals of the small-calibre shooting contest.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan competed in the finals of the small-calibre shooting competition, which was held at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and ranked first, the new Olympic record.
Kirill Grigoryan became the second - 628.9 dill.
In all, eight of the best athletes were in the finals.
Kamensky is the world record in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition Fethullah Gulen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d'état in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d'état,” quotes the French newspaper Le Monde, Gulen.
The Turkish opposition also stated that “if any part of the charges were confirmed, I would return to Turkey”.
However, Gulén denies any involvement in the coup d'état, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court previously arrested in absentia an opposition Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen.
Let us recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15-16 July.
Gilead companies will reimburse legal fees during a dispute over a patent from hepatitis C with Merck.
Guilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement for legal fees it incurred in a lawsuit over a patent for hepatitis C medicine with Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead's medicines, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge discovered a number of irregularities by Merck, including sworn lies and other unethical acts.
At the court hearing on Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to compensation for costs incurred in challenging the claim.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the laboratory work underlying the sophosbouvire, the active ingredient of the Gilead medicine.
U.S.-backed armed forces claim to have intercepted full control of Manbij from the Islamic State.
United States-backed armed forces seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left the city, and the team was informed by a spokesman on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now cleaning up the city after the remaining group of fighters who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militia, informed Reuters Agency Charfan Darwish of the allied military council of Manbij with VTS.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we're doing clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released his tax returns for 2015, which showed that the presidential candidate from the Democratic Party and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received some $5.3 million in performance fees, and the former Secretary of State announced a $3 million return from Simon & Schester for her book on her tenure in the Department of State.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, released tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency," said campaign adviser Clinton Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and violates his past promises to release his tax returns.
It's common practice for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited the State Revenue Service audit as a reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your move," tweeted campaign adviser Clinton Jan Sams, referring to the declaration of a Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the tests were completed.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican brothers in 2012, said that his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grasped the issue and released an online video on Friday that focused on outstanding Republicans who convinced Trump to release his tax report.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in a speech about the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades without exception: to publish his tax returns,” she said to the audience.
Politico reported that Trump had not paid any or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a business columnist in the New York Times quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who believed that they might still be doing so.
Federal tax rates were disputed in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire, investor Warren Buffett, that would ensure that people receiving over $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, he suggested Trump meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he was also under IRS scrutiny, and that Trump was not afraid of the tax agency, but of the voters.
Clinton's elected headquarters released tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, in New York City, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration of 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from salaries.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons announced dividends and capital returns of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania are using an innovative way to prevent elephants from ploughing into communities by throwing condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, along with the United States Nature Conservation Committee, took over its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
A lot of people used spears earlier to protect themselves.
On Friday, there will be World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
“Since we have invented a set of tools... we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants,” said Executive Director Honeyguide Damian Bell.
The first two steps are to light a torch in front of a cross-border elephant and to give horn signals.
If he can't be scared off, they throw away the so-called chili cloud.
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with a clap in a condom, and its end is twisted, leaving only the wick outside.
When a condom is lit, it bursts with a bang, spraying little chili powder in the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn the elephant the other way.
The ultimate measure is a launcher that shoots Roman candles in the air, making a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats who left the country after the attempted coup d'état in July of this year have still not returned to Turkey.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevlüt Chavushoglu, spoke with local journalists.
In the first phase, we withdrew 208 staff diplomats to continue their work in the centre.
Of these, 32 did not return without objective reasons and explanations,” said the head of the Turkish foreign policy agency.
It should be recalled that an attempted coup d'état took place in Turkey in July.
The authorities had officially declared that the coup d ' état had failed and had also reported the detention of more than 6,000 persons, including senior and middle-ranking military officials.
According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 290 people died as a result of the coup attempt.
The Jewish director strongly criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's telephone code on the Arab “request” – reported RT News
A French director of Jewish origin started a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have Israel's phone code on the list, and officials referred to "requests" from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of a documentary on the Holocaust, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media, FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lantzman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the telephone code list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the States to which you can call directly from the room.
In 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, how could Israel be expelled and eradicated?
He wrote Lantzman.
In exchange, the Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the issue at the hotel's office.
The answer he received there was, according to Lanzman, "shocked him."
The hotel clerk said that this measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel network."
The reason behind this move has caused even greater anger on the part of the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's code be deleted," said Lanzman, hotel employee.
Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Jacov Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as “a terrible disgrace,” reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and this hotel network is even more embarrassing.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident caused a lot of publicity on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply "was on the line" with the alleged demands of Arab clients.
“Be ashamed of yourself,” said another post, where it was stated that the hotel on the glorious street of Kurfurstendamm was near the synagogue.
The hotel itself rushed to dismiss any charges, calling it an "inaudit" and "apologize" to Lanzman, reports Der Spiegel.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel in the rapid recruitment list,” quotes the representative of the Kempinski Hotel in Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they met to protest against government reforms in public education.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riots began when the police tried to disperse the students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in a demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of São Paulo State, Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some protesters were seen writing graffiti on the walls against interim President Michael Temer.
This last protest took place just a few days after the protesters came to the streets to support the suspended President, Dilma Roussef, when the Senate voted in favour of her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71% – reports RT Business portal
With the lifting of the sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador Levan Jagaryan of Iran.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest on the part of Russian firms in doing business in the country, said the ambassador.
Russian companies are reconnecting with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent from the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was due to the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the Ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic representation in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran entered the top 20 countries for the first time in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year’s record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition,” he said.
The State continues to roll nuts in the defence and industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the director-general of Almaz-Antey, the “miss of work” and the “loss of trust”.
Gennady Benderski has been appointed as NGO leader for the next three years.
The news of Nestrorodov's dismissal did not appear until Thursday evening and did not give rise to widespread media resonance.
How can such silence be explained in the context of large-scale rearmament of the army?
It is likely that the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumours or negative assumptions in the public domain.
This confirms once again that the defence and industrial complex (DFC) has many problems and the State does not wish to attract greater public attention to them.
The removal of Non-Springer is undoubtedly an important development in terms of industrial order.
The NGO Almaz is the parent company of the company that specializes in the production of maritime and land-based anti-aircraft missile systems.
At present, Almaz is working on the establishment of the Poliment-Redut and Morpheus ZKP, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia portal, Dmitry Cornev, believes that Nestrorodov's dismissal is due to a delay in the projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007 and was expected to be operational in 2013.
Poliment-Red should be the main air defence system on the newest Navy ships.
According to the information I'm receiving, no real success has been achieved in a few years of testing.
The truth is, as far as I can tell, it's not exactly the fault of "Almaz," said Cornev.
The expert is concerned that the "C-500" RAF may also delay entry into service.
Project development has not yet been completed, but the first compounds are expected to enter the troops during 2016.
The Department of Defense is assured that “work is being planned and everything will be completed within the prescribed time frame”, although in 2014 the agency acknowledged that there were problems with the development of the C-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the qualifications of Neskorodov, who has been managing Almaz since 2011.
Cornev noted that project disruptions could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in PCOs and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large amounts of money are known to love silence.
As a rule, directors of defence companies resign on their own volition, under an agreement between the parties, or are reassigned to other jobs.
In this case, the suspension took place in public, although it was not resonated.
This suggests that the leader of the Diamond may have been a figure of strategist, resisting the top-down "orders."
It seems that the State no longer intends to tolerate such behaviour.
With the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the Department of Defense ' s installations and fail to fulfil its objectives.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish corrupt managers (the “Star” shipyard scheme).
The President himself has given increased attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin chairs the Military Industrialization Commission and holds periodic rearmament meetings.
The Kremlin defends the ranks of PKK managers by seeking to have a loyal board of directors who will follow orders from above.
This is far from ideal policy, but the State has no other instruments against the backdrop of corruption and a lack of normal competition in CCPs.
The current situation in defence is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation is encouraging the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning-up” of managers in the PKK, the Russian Federation leadership has taken quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The army has acquired a new quality with the assumption of the post of Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoiga.
The president seems to have adopted the famous saying, "You want peace, prepare for war."
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established Moscow’s sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the flaws in the bipolar system, it worked quite well.
Proof of this was the absence of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the “winners” in the cold war ultimately resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of attacks in Europe and the United States, there seems to be no quiet corner left in the "civilized world".
Despite the common disaster, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
Under such conditions, the fleet and the army remain the only allies of our country.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to better defend national interests and enter the new frontier of world politics.
The Scotsman Callum Skinner runs the finish line, causing the British to capture bicycle gold.
The Scottish Callum Skinner raced to triumph in a male team sprint at a bicycle show in Rio last night, as a result of which the British command trio protected its title from London in 2012.
A 23-year-old from Glasgow was the strongest that his fellow Scottish Sir Chris Hoy had made his own, and the young man proudly entered history running through the finish line to win a victory from the New Zealand Favorite team.
Britain claimed rights to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed rights to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Championships in London, even though Hoy had since finished his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staffe's specialist.
They did exactly as they did when the Hindes showed up.
Hoy's departure also created a void that Kian Emady and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches, seeing potential in a Scotsman, which was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny, the Hoy champions four years ago, and Skinner set the Olympic record, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind him after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner was supportive.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes went on a larger show to slow down and let Kenny and especially Skinner keep up the pace.
Hoy observed from his seat as a BBC guest expert and caught Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes' eyes when they joined the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes deliberately fell to the track after a failed start.
He later recanted the comment, and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such question this time for the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like London, with all those British flags on the podium."
We've all met like a team in the last three months.
We've lost so many races with a world name that it's been amazing to win the Olympics again.
It's one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten race titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress over the past five months, then the bike has five more successful days ahead of it.
With Kenny's uniform, it's not beyond the ability to imagine how he replicates Hoy's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would make it possible to see Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (this seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) — bring his account to six gold medals and one silver medal.
It'd be just like Hoy's.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team racing is always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely winning alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must win the knighthood."
It was the only medal that ever happened, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke, and Owen Dooll are qualified for the fastest four-kilometre command race of four.
They finished at 3:51,943.
The world record for winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be the focus of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In an appropriate women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Shend, Elinor Barker and Cathy Archibald of Milngawi improved the world record by showing 4:13,260 times.
Britain’s team has come to rely on a strong team of cyclists to own the middle of the Olympic Games and earn a bunch of medals.
After the truly exceptional demonstrations of absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the second place, not the last, the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April due to allegations of sexism and harassment, and the departure of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first night's race on the bike, it seems that the now legendary glory of Britain in reaching its peak at the right time may just happen again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant is threatened by the cancellation of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminium factory in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of its owners, is about to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to extend the subsidies provided to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed grant for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the steel mill consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down a steel mill in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the Englesey power plant last year.
The Portland Alcoa steel factory loses money and risks closure.
These actions were the outcome of a reflection on the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, initially because of the strong position of the Australian dollar and later because of the price of the plant ' s products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Young A power plant in Latrob Valley, said it expected the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contracts.
The controlling share of the plant is owned by a joint short-term enterprise between Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
“AGL expects that the Portland facility will continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, the contracts in question were so-called “hedged contracts”, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"As a consequence, AGL still expects these contracts to deliver their share of the revenue in fiscal year 2017," said the electricity company.
Any potential impact on AGL’s profits since the financial year 2018 is now limited by forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in terms of "forecoming termination".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect the ability of Alcoa to operate the metallurgical plant or to supply electricity to the metallurgical plant”.
The American company stated that it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November this year, but that it had yet to explain why it had terminated the contract.
The analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland steel factory in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL's chief of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen, said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us, as a producer, that would be bad," he said.
Not just Kardashian reality show star Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter of Cardashian-Jenner Mother Manager Chris, appeared on the desired September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Eastey Lauder brand and who defiled during fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"As I was in the room with my favorite people, I looked at this cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The cover news was strange (or simply in the spirit of the Kardashian Family?) prepared by a reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (Rob and Caitlin, who also joined them as the world's favorite show business uncle, producer of the Kardashian Family, Ryan Seacrest), forgot the appearance of her sister on the cover, and at the end, a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It's the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's birthday television shows (Sicrest says, "Did you think we'd forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit in the program at 8:00 a.m.), but Chris needed to get that glory somehow to the other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Even though Kendall Kim's older sister was on Vogue's cover earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the best-selling issue of Vogue in the year.
More like a gift edition than a fashion magazine, it attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the Fashionista accounts, 615 pages from last year's 832-page edition were advertised).
The news of which stars will be on his cover is so much expected that in the last two years, the magazine's photos have merged before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly represented more “remarks that work models” than “models that are celebrities”.
The winner of the Oscar Award and the face of the brand Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gage's honour.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, who was described by the magazine as the "outstanding model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality-show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
They're really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the best in his career with the release of Lemonade's album.
Of course, not everyone's happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, in view of her past star television reality show, always had to remain fragile.
In June, one of Victoria's first models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
These moods have been rife again after the news of Jenner appearing on Vogue's cover.
But it doesn't make sense to dwell on discontent.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you Estonian Lauder cream.
She, and all of her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available on a fee-paying subscription.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter herself to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, maybe to still see her sister Courtney and her kids, she's on a reality TV show.
Public law centres refuse to provide services to 160,000 persons per year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the least protected people are denied services in public law centres, as the sector is preparing for an impact that will further cut funding to already stretched activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly older people, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to cope with unfair deprivation of property, and so on — have already been denied access to free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside the scope of their capacity are preparing for further reductions.
From June of next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of Queensland Public Law Centers, James Farrell, said that according to the latest census report of the National Association of Public Law Centers, thousands of people a year have been rejected.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not overturned, the situation will only get worse.
“The Queensland Public Law Centers are consistently underfunded, meaning that thousands of people are denied vital services they need,” he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families going through divorce, unfairly dismissed workers -- all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected people in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately cancel these cuts in funding so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government met its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to focus on the needs of public law centres and communities, their clients, and the Palachuk Government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign headquarters was sued after a staff member allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York City, Donald Trump's campaign headquarters was sued: it is alleged that the headquarters did nothing after reporting that his operating director in North Carolina had threatened a staff member with a gun while driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday with the state court in Charlotte Vincent Bordiny, a former software instructor at the state election headquarters.
Brady said he'd been waiting months for the problem to be resolved internally, but he realized that "that's not going to happen."
Director Earl Phillip "takes out the gun, puts his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the blow on Vincent's kneecap," says Brady in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional office of the campaign headquarters, Bordiny realized that at least four more people had been involved in similar incidents with Phillip, and was reportedly being treated.
"Pistols don't have to shoot to cause harm," said Bordiny in the complaint.
The lawsuit took place just two days after the Republican presidential candidate made a furor, telling North Carolina’s listeners that “the Second Amendment people” — understood as arms owners and their amateurs — could act if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and could choose judges.
Trump's select headquarters said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken in favour of violence.
In his complaint, Bordiny claims compensation from the campaign staff for negligent control, and Phillip for threats of physical violence, assault and mental harm.
Representative Trump Hope Hicks is slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left campaign headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ran a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordiny v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg High Court Division (Charlott).
Britain must harness the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Renaissance and prosperity, not only in our localities here and in London as a whole, but also throughout the country, will also bring sanity and prosperity.
To me, this was exactly the huge advantage of Heathrow, just like it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympic Games were of great benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we'll do it again, creating opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow.
For our communities here alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Like London 2012, there will be those who think Heathrow expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would be in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Heathrow Olympics, it is an infrastructure project for most people, not just for the narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent team in Heathrow, which has introduced the 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment program on time and within budget, from T5 — the top terminal of the airport for five consecutive years, to T2 built in the middle of the world's two most occupied airstrips.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 Olympic Games in London were a huge success for the UK, and I'm sure Heathrow expansion will also be.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton — Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Trade Attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing cat-mouses about blocking ads.
For companies that make money in Internet advertising, trying to bypass software to block advertising is a game of cat-mouse, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertising blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted on the blog that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social media again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site would change the crowd around its ads to make it harder for advertising blockers to recognize which parts of the page were advertising.
But Adblock now claims to be able to bypass the new code.
In his blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open source blocker community and those trying to circumvent it has continued since the invention of the blockage," and that Facebook may be presenting its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world's largest social network has entered the struggle is a clear indication of how much of the problem has become for industry blockers.
Worldwide, some 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to last year's study of Pagefair and Adobe; nearly four times as many people used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising income.
However, the company hunts the desktop version blockers, as mobile blockers are not effective in Facebook mobile applications for social media and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, the desktop ad is a lucrative enough article for Facebook to consider such a move a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its "advertising preference" tool to give people more control over how they were being targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters were disturbing, as they would also block some non-advertising content on the website.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said a Facebook representative in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a crude tool, so we instead focused on creating tools like Advertising preferences to hand over control to people.
A woman was moved on a Swiss freeway in an episode of apparent suicide.
The victim was on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman moved several vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident took place on A1 near the Morge in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman took the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, and reported to the police in a statement.
In an apparent attempt to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police have informed them and others who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case, a “logical” step in this situation, was initiated by counsel Gilé Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That's what the D.A.'s supposed to determine, said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case, both involving a person walking in the dark on the highway, it was ruled that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on A1 near Payern in the night of August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim was drinking and unconscious on the road, hearing a trial.
The court found that a female police officer, who responded to an emergency call, was driving a vehicle in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was “a perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation”, the judge said.
Anyone who has information about an incident on Thursday near the Morges should call the police at 021,644,83 46 or 021,644,444.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have been once inhabited, according to the estimates of the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the Nasov Institute of Space Studies Goddard developed a model for research into the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions like the Earth could ever exist on Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide.
Scientists previously assumed that Venus's low rotation rate was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could probably have had a diluted atmosphere like the Earth and still rotate slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on the Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographic variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent of the party.
"According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus puts the sun on its afternoon side for almost two months at a time," explained the journalist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
It warms the planet’s surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer, acting as an umbrella that protects the planet’s surface from a substantial part of solar heat.
The result is average climatic temperatures, which, surprisingly, are a few degrees colder than they are today on Earth.
The model shows Venus's history similar to that previously envisaged by planetary researchers.
Although Venus may have been inhabited at one time, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapour was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen disappeared, all that remained was a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving the Avalanche team coach position.
Patrick Roy left as coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
Executive Vice President/Chief Manager Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as chief coach and vice president of the hockey activity Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Over the summer, I've been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey must match perfectly the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost the playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a 39-39-4 score in the 2015-2016 season and was five points behind Wild in the fight for a second favourable trip to the Western Conference.
The goalkeeper from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two each with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oilers resume negotiations and suspend strike
Work strikes on oil salaries in the North Sea have been suspended, and all sides of the discussion are entering a new round of talks, as reported by the leading representatives of the parties.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil service company were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiating process to resolve ongoing disputes”, says the joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of next week, to take a fresh look at the problems.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract workers in the North Sea by about 9 per cent this year due to negative market tensions.
The decline in the company ' s rates followed a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for shore-based contract employees in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts would give it the space it needed to overcome the recession.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries to 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-merger with the British power company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower prices for untreated oil: the economic situation worsened because of the decision to withdraw from the European Union in June.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for most, not just for some,” he said in the statement.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, in contrast to the average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiade cluster
The latest mission of the Space Telescope, Kepler, helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue of the rotational speeds of the stars forming part of the Pleiade cluster.
New data help astronomers to understand why stars in a cluster rotate at different speeds and how rotational periods relate to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology in a press release.
The Pleiade cluster is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are just reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll ever be again.
At their peak rotational speeds, these growing stars emit large amounts of star wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds act as a brake on the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star, tracking the time between recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest speed catalogue suggests that more massive stars rotate slowly than less massive stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: larger ones make pyruettes slower than smaller ones.
At the Pleiade Ballet, we see that those that spin slowly, usually more massive, while those that spin faster, usually belong to very light stars,” Riball said.
As the Pleiade cluster is so close, it is the ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with rotational speeds.
"The Pleiade Star Cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of rotation of stars, both younger and older," Riball said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, where, and why stars slow down their speed and hang their dance shoes on the nail, so to speak.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiade speeds in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Two agencies are investigating the activities of a group of Ukrainian subversive detainees in Crimea and writes "Commersant".
The FSB is gathering evidence of the detainees' involvement in the preparation of sabotages in Crimea.
As previously reported, a Ukrainian resident of Energodar Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation, made a confession.
According to him, he considered the Titan Chemical Plant in Armeniansk, the Peodosia Oil Base, the Kerchen ferry crossing, the gas pipeline and a military airfield as diversion sites.
Law enforcement believes that not all the collaborators of the sabotagers have been apprehended.
This was, inter alia, the basis for the arrest of the suspects in the Kiev Rhyde of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Cherchesov was the chief coach of Russia's football team.
At the meeting of the executive committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as the chief coach of the Russian football team.
The contract will last for two years, until the conclusion of the DM 2018.
On 11 August, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as Russia's chief football coach.
He was a well-known footballer who had played in Moscow's "Spartacus" goalkeeper position, as well as a well-established coach who mentored Russian teams such as the same "Spartacus" team, "The Pearl Sochi" and "Terek", "Amkar", "Dinamo" and "Legia" of Warsaw, who won the national first and the country's Cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed as soon as possible and will last for two years.
Thus, he is the one who is obliged to prepare the team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Pannikov, will be part of his coaching staff.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff is 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the Russian Federation’s leadership has set the goal of bringing Russia’s team to the semi-finals and winning medals.
As the coach himself stated, he considers it a priority to create a competitive environment for the team and is going to give the football players the opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Čerchesov, he's glad he's made a choice.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov will be held on 31 August in Antalya, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Let us recall that Leonid Slutsky previously served as the head coach of the Russian football team, combining him with his coach at the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after the Russian national team's failed performance at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the failure of the team.
Overwhelmed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, since its independence from South Africa in 1990, the country, with a population of 2.4 million, has made tremendous strides, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success was that the Government attached great importance to education.
While people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce training fees for “cost recovery”.
In Namibia, however, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also been free.
The authorities are also active in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of cases per year by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, a standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
At that time, 23 years ago, that figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also declined, from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The United States and other rich nations are far ahead of the country.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Corruption Perception Index, which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia also has some problems.
Unemployment, at least in traditional estimation methods, remains fairly high, at almost 28 per cent.
Like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS infection - almost 17 per cent of the population.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is among the upper middle-income countries, but the authorities insist that their State is in fact a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The State has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
There are isolated nomadic hunter-gatherers living in the deserts, who must be integrated into modern society in one way or another, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia had not given up, but it was addressing the challenges it faced.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities had begun to build a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that rival political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides affordable health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that separates the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that they did not choose their neighbours, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, participate in regional health projects, encourage investment and exchange of students.
Furthermore, the Namibian Government has rightly considered that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that Namibia ' s natural wealth must be invested in infrastructure and productive capacities.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum profit from the country ' s resources, and they are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, and strong government support for freedom of expression is so important.
As Head of State Hage Heingob noted, the media often say things he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has gained, says the President.
Not all of Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, were renewable, and the Government was making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Each year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia has shown that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings — racism, colonialism, inequality and underdevelopment — can embark on the path of shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard of the Golden of Varna, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600-4200 B.C.E.).
Perhaps it was the most dramatic archaeological sensation in the 1970s: Bulgaria, during the excavation of the Varnen Necropolis, found a fantastic amount of gold artifacts - more than 3,000 weighing six kilograms.
Only one grave, known as Mogil No. 43, produced 990 gold items with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold may soon turn to the unscrupulous bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
Again in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, a port town, Tell Yunacite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunacite in the Pazarjik district.
The bead is a golden stripe wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Boyajiev, the dig leader at Tella Yunacit, dated the discovery 4,600 B.C.E., and stated that she was at least 200 years older than Varna's gold.
Varna’s treasures, let us recall, date from about the same period, 4,600 to 4200 B.C.E.
There are currently no technologies that can date the metal with precision.
How can you be sure which gold is more ancient?
Apparently, Professor Boyajiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I'm pretty sure Yunacyte's gold is older than Varna's gold."
It's an extremely important find: it looks like a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Boyadziev, scientists will soon analyse the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine and study the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location explains a lot, too.
Tell Yunacite is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Tell Yunacite is now considered the oldest city in Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium B.C.E.
Over the next centuries, metal processing in the region has developed rapidly, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the establishment of a full-fledged industry.
In the national history of this archaeological community, the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province has a special name.
In the 5th millennium B.C.E., urban settlements began to emerge around metal processing centres.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tall Yunacite may be the oldest, because the artifacts of 4900 BC were found.
I'd call Tell Yunacite a prototype of a modern city, even though it's an ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This place is a thousand years older than Sumer,” says the Boyajiev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in the south of Mesopotamia, a modern Iraq.
There, the first cities were created in the usual sense of the word.
Telly Yunacite's excavations have been under way since 1976.
During that time, archaeologists dug up almost 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total settlement area.
Remains of the serf wall were found, once reaching three metres high.
There is little left of houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, urban dense buildings, a “business centre” and residential suburbs.
Tell Yunacite is often called the Bird City, where dozens of clay birds were found.
All birds are depicted in a state of rest, suggesting that they were not decorative objects, but objects of a local cult.
Bird City was destroyed around 4100 B.C., possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
The nomads had no towns, but they had horses and guns.
The three - metre walls of the fortress did not stop them.
Archaeologists found obvious signs of atrocious slaughter: within the houses, remains of old people, women and children were found with traces of wounds caused by battle axes.
New findings and new facts emerge every year, changing the way we see ancient human history.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly referring not to individual cultures, but to the lost first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
The “Golden Varna” found relatively recently, in 1972, was a powerful incentive in the search for this civilization.
Logically, Varna's golden luxury had to be preceded by something like a tiny golden bead created in Tella Yunacite.
In Porsche, the 911 Targa model was artificially aged.
It is officially stated that the training of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the unit who work with serial machines.
"Retro-Look" consists, for example, of a special colour for the body of Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, even the model logo was painted in that color.
In addition, the targa received a brand-new white graph along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel discs, as well as some body design details painted in white and gold metal.
Retro-drawn interiors are markedly smaller: they differ, in large part, from grey-blue gamma to new chairs with extended electrical banding and separated black anodized steel-based floors with a unit logo.
In addition, when a special version is purchased, each buyer will receive a gift car cover and a richly separated album with photographs of the production process.
The power plant of the Porsche Exclusive did not touch: the retro-targa is quite the same as the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a 3.0 litre turbocharged engine developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in four seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued in limited print runs, but neither the volume nor the value of each particular sports car is reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers started an arms race.
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented the cover-up of advertisements on social media pages, provoked decision makers to block advertising in response.
The AdBlock Plus released an anti-venom, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus promoted its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
Social media representatives noted that in an attempt to deceive the new technology of unblockable advertising, the AdBlock Plus decision, along with commercial ads, also blocked many regular posts from friends or pages.
Facebook deplored this policy by AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among social media developers of TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook's desktop website will be ready within the next hours.
So the social media and the blockers started a sort of "arms race," trying to beat each other, the injured side became users who missed interesting recordings from friends or saw ads where they weren't used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of the blocking of advertising have recently been a source of heated debate.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought before the court; Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been completed in the Russian Federation's Investigation Committee for the Murmansk Region.
The charge against a 54-year-old man is very serious - sexual assault.
The investigation found that, at the end of November 2015, the accused in the Pavlova Street area of Murmansk committed sexual acts with violence against a 20-year-old girl. The criminal case with the confirmed indictment was sent for trial on the merits.
The sanction provided for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring the Fengguang 370 cross-van to Russia and the Rich New pick-up site behind the wheel www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a member of China's most popular car class, combining minivan and crossover.
Another declared Russian premiere is the Rich New pick-up truck.
Many Western firms in the Moscow International Highway have decided this year to ignore the emptiness of Crocus Expo's exhibition halls, which will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation will be a powerful front, with large views on the Russian market and the intention in the near future to offer our auto lovers a number of interesting innovations.
One of them will be Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which was sold in China this spring at a price of RMB 55,900 (just under RMB 550,000 at current rates).
Russia is unlikely to have such a value, and the issue of supply to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to make it to number 11 on the list of the most sold minivans in June, although due to a large road clearance (175 mm) and a protective plastic covering on the lower perimeter of the body, it can easily be attributed to crossovers.
Crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the junior Fengguang 360 model, and 370 has a similar wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4,565 mm versus 4,510 mm), the design is more robust, and the equipment is richer.
The hall is decorated with wooden barboards, but the large vertical sensory screen "like Tesla's" on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of the cross-van, and the "music" cars were sold.
Five of the seven seats are easily stacked, forming a smooth loading area with a length of 1,650 mm and a maximum boot capacity of 1,500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine has only one - 1.5-litre 115 hp petrol "atmosphere" connected to a 5-speed manual gearbox.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the machine, but promises an appetite budget of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara from the previous generation, but with a little Chinese styled design.
Despite its morally outdated design, the model is still in stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and non-hospital “work horse”.
At a similar price, Rich New will certainly be interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickup trucks have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two choice engines: petrol 2.4 litres (137 h.s.) or turbodiesel 2.5 litres (116 h.s.).
The gearbox is only mechanical, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigidly plugged front.
He will be on the Dongfeng stand and the new A9 flagship sedan, and his Russian Premier's office was announced by the Chinese firm as early as June.
Minwano-like crossovers are growing in the Chinese market, one of the latest developments - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Dongfeng line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
In the seven months of this year, Chinese dealers sold 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices will stop sending mail - website behind the wheel www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate changed the procedure for issuing notices of property taxes.
All Russian auto-owners are accustomed to an unchanging scheme: they receive mail receipts for the previous year’s transport tax in the summer and autumn.
However, many of them will not be expected this year.
The fact is, the tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for notifying citizens without undue noise.
Those who are registered with the Taxpayer's Personal Cabinet on the official website of the nalog.ru will be informed electronically.
Inspections automatically considered such Russians to be online users and deleted them from the standard, “paper” mailing list.
All vehicle and real estate owners will be affected.
Everyone else will continue to receive the usual letters.
However, the owners of the account on the site also have the possibility of going back to the old scheme.
In order to do so, they would have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notice will appear in the “personal office” as soon as it is written, while the letter will go on for a few days and may be lost altogether.
In addition, the number of Internet service users of the tax inspectorate exceeded 18 million, which would allow the agency to save a lot on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some may have registered in a “personal office” to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait to be notified in the mail and, without knowing, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the Taxpayer's Personal Office is done in three ways: through the account of the Gosuslugi.ru portal, by electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person from any branch of the tax inspectorate (regardless of the place of registration).
We recall that this year the transport tax must be paid before 1 December.
Notifications began in July.
A Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, which is designed to achieve very high returns, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not embarrass the masters of the G-Power company, who were engaged in modifying the Mercedes-AMG G63 sport version.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human masters are alien.
Indeed, why not upgrade the G 63 to 571-strong flying sledgehammer with tank aerodynamics and up to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Inflating the muscles of a crazy "helician," the masters took advantage of the 5.5-litre inflatable "eight."
But the momentum of dispersal up to a hundred has improved by indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying brick is capable of a 5.3 s jump.
However, average speed accelerations are probably better for him.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if a standard G63 is not driven faster than 210 km/h, a full-vehicle with a deactivated electronic collar can squeeze 250 km/h.
Outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its original source, except for the other 23-inch Hurricane RR wheel discs of 305.35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach suite announced an amazing concept coupe 6 m long, which will be presented as part of the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "green subbrand" BMW i and will promote its electrical models under a separate brand name.
A minimum of four green innovations are expected in the coming years.
